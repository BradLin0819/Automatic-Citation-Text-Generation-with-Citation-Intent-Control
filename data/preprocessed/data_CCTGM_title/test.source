@background global data re-allocation via communication aggregation in chapel the next generations of supercomputers are projected to have hundreds of thousands of processors. however, as the numbers of processors grow, the scalability of applications will be the dominant challenge. this forces us to reexamine some of our fundamental ways that we approach the design and use of parallel languages and runtime systems. in this paper we show how the globally shared arrays in a popular partitioned global address space (pgas) language, unified parallel c (upc), can be combined with a new collective interface to improve both performance and scalability. this interface allows subsets, or teams, of threads to perform a collective together. as opposed to mpi's communicators, our interface allows set of threads to be placed in teams instantly rather than explicitly constructing communicators, thus allowing for a more dynamic team construction and manipulation. we motivate our ideas with three application kernels: dense matrix multiplication, dense cholesky factorization and multidimensional fourier transforms. we describe how the three aforementioned applications can be succinctly written in upc thereby aiding productivity. we also show how such an interface allows for scalability by running on up to 16,384 processors on the blue-gene/l. in a few lines of upc code, we wrote a dense matrix multiply routine achieves 28.8 tflop/s and a 3d fft that achieves 2.1 tflop/s. we analyze our performance results through models and show that the machine resources rather than the interfaces themselves limit the performance.
@result prevalence rates of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity among adolescents in iran. we conducted a household survey of 3,012 adults aged 18 and over in order to estimate the prevalence of dsm-iv obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) in urban areas in konya, turkey. trained psychiatry interns administered the 2.1 version of the ocd section of the composite international diagnostic interview (cidi). the 12-month period prevalence rate of ocd was 3.0%. the mean age of onset of ocd was 25.9 +/- 12.5 (range, 7 to 63) years. the prevalence rate of ocd was slightly higher among females (males 2.5%, females 3.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant. the relative risk for divorced, separated, or widowed subjects was approximately 4.2 times higher for ocd than others (2.7% v 10.5%). the 1-year prevalence of ocd inversely related to age group in male subjects, but increased with age in female subjects. the prevalence rate of ocd was not different by the level of education, except it was statistically higher among subjects who were literate but had no schooling, of which the causal relationship was high prevalence rate of ocd among female literate-but no schooling subjects. subjects with few (one or two) and more siblings (seven or more) had a significantly higher prevalence rate of ocd than subjects with moderate numbers of siblings (three to six). no significant difference was found according to employment, fertility, birth order, and income of the subjects. about 30% of subjects with ocd had only obsessions, whereas 68.5% had both obsessions and compulsions. only one subject (1.1%) with ocd met compulsion criteria without obsessions. the prevalence rate of ocd we found in konya, turkey was similar to the prevalence rates of most epidemiological studies.
@background quality of life and nutritional consequences after aboral pouch reconstruction following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer: randomized controlled trial ccg1101 quality of life is an important outcome measure in the care of patients with cancer. we developed a new scoring system specifically for the evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. this study was undertaken to evaluate the scoring system’s validity in comparing outcomes after gastric resection. patients with gastric cancer, 3 months to 3 years postoperatively, were surveyed using the survey instrument. postoperative dysfunction scores and the status of resuming activities of daily living were compared with the surgical procedure performed by analysis of variance and multiple-comparison techniques. of 211 patients surveyed, 165 (119 men, 46 women; mean age, 65.1 ± 10.5 years) responded. procedures included distal gastrectomy in 100, total gastrectomy in 57, and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 8. the overall dysfunction score was 61.8 ± 15.5. the dysfunction score was 58.9 ± 15.0 after distal gastrectomy, 66.8 ± 14.1 after total gastrectomy, and 62.4 ± 21.6 after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy. these values differed significantly among the groups (p = .007). dysfunction scores according to postoperative activity status were 49.1 ± 15.6 in 71 patients who resumed their activities, 56.9 ± 15.7 in 39 patients with reduced activities, 57.3 ± 8.8 in 15 patients with minimal activities, and 63.3 ± 11.8 (p < .05) in 16 patients who did not resume activities because of poor physical condition. this scoring system for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction provides an objective measure of dysfunction related to specific surgical procedures and correlates with activities of daily living in the postoperative period.
@method homeostatic regulation of h‐conductance controls intrinsic excitability and stabilizes the threshold for synaptic modification in ca1 neurons in the cortex, synaptic latencies display small variations ( approximately 1-2 ms) that are generally considered to be negligible. we show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of l5 and ca3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of pr. changes in synaptic latency were also observed when pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic ltd and reduced after ltp induction. we show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. in conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.
@background a cell line-based neutralization assay for primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates that use either the ccr5 or the cxcr4 coreceptor abstract we have investigated whether the identity of the coreceptor (ccr5, cxcr4, or both) used by primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) isolates to enter cd4+ cells influences the sensitivity of these isolates to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and cd4-based agents. coreceptor usage was not an important determinant of neutralization titer for primary isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. we also studied whether dualtropic primary isolates (able to use both ccr5 and cxcr4) were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the same antibodies when entering u87mg-cd4 cells stably expressing either ccr5 or cxcr4. again, we found that the coreceptor used by a virus did not greatly affect its neutralization sensitivity. similar results were obtained for ccr5- or cxcr4-expressing hos cell lines engineered to express green fluorescent protein as a reporter of hiv-1 entry. neutralizing antibodies are therefore unlikely to be the major selection pressure which drives the phenotypic evolution (change in coreceptor usage) of hiv-1 that can occur in vivo. in addition, the increase in neutralization sensitivity found when primary isolates adapt to growth in transformed cell lines in vitro has little to do with alterations in coreceptor usage.
@method human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung progenitor and alveolar epithelial cells attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury. the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) provides the opportunity to use patient‐specific somatic cells, which are a valuable source for disease modeling and drug discovery. to promote research involving these cells, it is important to make ipscs from easily accessible and less invasive tissues, like blood. we have recently reported the efficient generation of human ipscs from adult fibroblasts using a combination of plasmids encoding oct3/4, sox2, klf4, l‐myc, lin28, and shrna for tp53. we herein report a modified protocol enabling efficient ipsc induction from cd34+ cord blood cells and from peripheral blood isolated from healthy donors using these plasmid vectors. the original plasmid mixture could induce ipscs; however, the efficiency was low. the addition of ebna1, an essential factor for episomal amplification of the vectors, by an extra plasmid greatly increased the efficiency of ipsc induction, especially when the induction was performed from αβt cells. this improvement enabled the establishment of blood‐derived ipscs from seven healthy donors ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s. this induction method will be useful for the derivation of patient‐specific integration‐free ipscs and would also be applicable to the generation of clinical‐grade ipscs in the future. stem cells2013;31:458–466
@method comparative effectiveness of different types of splenectomy for children with congenital hemolytic anemias. background open partial splenectomy provides reversal of anemia and relief of symptomatic splenomegaly while theoretically retaining splenic immune function for hereditary spherocytosis. we recently developed a laparoscopic approach for partial splenectomy. the purpose of the present study is to compare the outcomes in a group of patients undergoing laparoscopic partial splenectomy (lps) with those in a group of children undergoing laparoscopic total splenectomy (lts) over the same period.   methods systematic chart review was conducted of all children with hereditary spherocytosis who had lts or lps from 2000 to 2006 at the hospital for sick children, toronto, ontario, canada. t tests were used for continuous data, and chi(2) for proportional data; p value of less than .05 was considered significant.   results there were 9 patients (14 males) in each group. groups were similar in sex, age, concomitant cholecystectomy, and preoperative hospitalizations, transfusions, and spleen size. estimated blood loss was greater in the lps group (188 + 53 vs 67 + 17 ml; p = .02), but transfusion requirements were similar (1/9 vs 0/9). complication rate was similar between groups. the lps group had higher morphine use (4.1 + 0.6 vs 2.4 + 0.2 days; p = .03), greater time to oral intake (4.4 + 0.7 vs 2.0 + 0.2 days; p = .01), and longer hospital stay (6.3 + 1.0 vs 2.7 + 0.3 days; p = .005) than the lts group. nuclear scan 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively demonstrated residual perfused splenic tissue in all lps patients. no completion splenectomy was necessary after a mean follow-up of 25 months.   conclusion these data suggest that lps is as effective as lts for control of symptoms. however, lps is associated with more pain, longer time to oral intake, and longer hospital stay. these disadvantages may be balanced by retained splenic immune function, but further studies are required to assess long-term splenic function in these patients.
@background nude-l, a novel lis1-interacting protein, belongs to a family of vertebrate coiled-coil proteins lis1 is a product of the causative gene for type i lissencephaly characterized by a smooth brain surface due to a defect in neuronal migration during brain development and a regulatory subunit of platelet‐activating factor acetylhydrolase (paf‐ah). it is also a mammalian homologue of the fungal nuclear distribution (nud) gene, nudf, which controls the migration of fungal nuclei. using the two‐hybrid system, we identified a novel lis1‐interacting protein, rat nude (rnude), and found that it is a mammalian homologue of another fungal nud gene product, nude, and xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein 43 which is phosphorylated in a cell cycle‐dependent manner. rnude and the catalytic subunits of paf‐ah interact with the n‐ and c‐termini of lis1, respectively. however, these proteins, instead of simultaneously binding to lis1, appeared to bind to lis1 in a competitive manner. these results suggest that lis1 functions in nuclear migration by interacting with multiple intracellular proteins in mammals.
@background a systematic review of interventions by healthcare professionals on community-dwelling postmenopausal women with osteoporosis background exercise programs improve balance, strength and agility in elderly people and thus may prevent falls. however, specific exercise programs that might be widely used in the community and that might be "prescribed" by physicians, especially for patients with osteoporosis, have not been evaluated. we conducted a randomized controlled trial of such a program designed specifically for women with osteoporosis.   methods we identified women 65 to 75 years of age in whom osteoporosis had been diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in our hospital between 1996 and 2000 and who were not engaged in regular weekly programs of moderate or hard exercise. women who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to participate in a twice-weekly exercise class or to not participate in the class. we measured baseline data and, 20 weeks later, changes in static balance (by dynamic posturography), dynamic balance (by a timed figure-eight run) and knee extension strength (by dynamometry).   results of 93 women who began the trial, 80 completed it. before adjustment for covariates, the intervention group tended to have greater, although nonsignificant, improvements in static balance (mean difference 4.8%, 95% confidence interval [ci] -1.3% to 11.0%), dynamic balance (mean difference 3.3%, 95% ci -1.7% to 8.4%) and knee extension strength (mean difference 7.8%, 95% ci -5.4% to 21.0%). mean crude changes in the static balance score were -0.85 (95% ci -2.91 to 1.21) for the control group and 1.40 (95% ci -0.66 to 3.46) for the intervention group. mean crude changes in figure-eight velocity (dynamic balance) were 0.08 (95% ci 0.02 to 0.14) m/s for the control group and 0.14 (95% ci 0.08 to 0.20) m/s for the intervention group. for knee extension strength, mean changes were -0.58 (95% ci -3.02 to 1.81) kg/m for the control group and 1.03 (95% ci -1.31 to 3.34) kg/m for the intervention group. after adjustment for age, physical activity and years of estrogen use, the improvement in dynamic balance was 4.9% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.044). after adjustment for physical activity, cognitive status and number of fractures ever, the improvement in knee extension strength was 12.8% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.047). the intervention group also had a 6.3% greater improvement in static balance after adjustment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.06).   interpretation relative to controls, participants in the exercise program experienced improvements in dynamic balance and strength, both important determinants of risk for falls, particularly in older women with osteoporosis.
@result potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in the developing rat brain. physiological cell death (pcd), a process by which redundant or unsuccessful neurons are deleted by apoptosis (cell suicide) from the developing central nervous system, has been recognized as a natural phenomenon for many years. whether environmental factors can interact with pcd mechanisms to increase the number of neurons undergoing pcd, thereby converting this natural phenomenon into a pathological process, is an interesting question for which new answers are just now becoming available. in a series of recent studies we have shown that 2 major classes of drugs (those that block nmda glutamate receptors and those that promote gabaa receptor activation), when administered to immature rodents during the period of synaptogenesis, trigger widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the developing brain. in addition, we have found that ethanol, which has both nmda antagonist and gabamimetic properties, triggers a robust pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration, thereby deleting large numbers of neurons from many different regions of the developing brain. these findings provide a more likely explanation than has heretofore been available for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). the period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period, occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. in rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. thus, there is a period in pre‐ and postnatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature cns neurons are prone to commit suicide if exposed to intoxicating concentrations of drugs with nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. these findings are important, not only because of their relevance to the fas, but because there are many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, that have nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers (ethanol, phencyclidine [angel dust], ketamine [special k], nitrous oxide [laughing gas], barbiturates, benzodiazepines), and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either nmda antagonists or gabamimetics).
@result effects of ethylene on secondary xylem formation in arabidopsis thaliana the plant hormone ethylene is an important signal in plant growth responses to environmental cues. in vegetative growth, ethylene is generally considered as a regulator of cell expansion, but a role in the control of meristem growth has also been suggested based on pharmacological experiments and ethylene-overproducing mutants. in this study, we used transgenic ethylene-insensitive and ethylene-overproducing hybrid aspen (populus tremula × tremuloides) in combination with experiments using an ethylene perception inhibitor [1-methylcyclopropene (1-mcp)] to demonstrate that endogenous ethylene produced in response to leaning stimulates cell division in the cambial meristem. this ethylene-controlled growth gives rise to the eccentricity of populus stems that is formed in association with tension wood.
@method vessel segmentation and catheter detection in x-ray angiograms using superpixels segmentation of coronary arteries in x-ray angiography is a fundamental tool to evaluate arterial diseases and choose proper coronary treatment. the accurate segmentation of coronary arteries has become an important topic for the registration of different modalities, which allows physicians rapid access to different medical imaging information from computed tomography (ct) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). in this paper, we propose an accurate fully automatic algorithm based on graph-cuts for vessel centerline extraction, caliber estimation, and catheter detection. vesselness, geodesic paths, and a new multiscale edgeness map are combined to customize the graph-cuts approach to the segmentation of tubular structures, by means of a global optimization of the graph-cuts energy function. moreover, a novel supervised learning methodology that integrates local and contextual information is proposed for automatic catheter detection. we evaluate the method performance on three datasets coming from different imaging systems. the method performs as good as the expert observer with respect to centerline detection and caliber estimation. moreover, the method discriminates between arteries and catheter with an accuracy of 96.5%, sensitivity of 72%, and precision of 97.4%.
@background novel technique for high-precision stereotactic irradiation of mouse brains seventy hamsters were divided equally into experimental groups a and b and control groups c-g. after treating the pouches of groups a and b animals with dmba (thrice a week) for 14 weeks, the heads of the animals received fractionated radiation of a total dose of 21gy and 42gy, respectively. the untreated pouches of groups c and d animals were similarly irradiated. the pouches of groups e and f animals were treated with dmba or mineral oil for 14 weeks, respectively. the pouches of group g animals remained untreated throughout the experiment. radiation response (rr) was not noted for 12 exophytic tumors of group a; the remaining 43 tumors showed partial response. for group b, no rr was noted for four exophytic lesions; the remaining 28 lesions revealed a combination of partial and complete response. no endophytic lesions of group a showed rr; a significant increase in radiation response was noted for group b compared with group a. in conclusion, the hamster pouch oral cancer model could be employed to study the effect of fractionated radiation.
@method novel solutions for side information generation and fusion in multiview dvc this paper introduces a hybrid forward-error correction/automatic repeat-request (arq) system that employs rate compatible punctured turbo (rcpt) codes to achieve enhanced throughput performance over a nonstationary gaussian channel. the proposed rcpt-arq system combines the performance of turbo codes with the frugal use of incremental redundancy inherent in the rate compatible punctured convolutional codes of hagenauer (1988). moreover, this paper introduces the notion of puncturing the systematic code symbols of a turbo code to maximize throughput at signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) of interest. the resulting system provides both an efficient family of achievable code rates at middle to high snr and powerful low-rate error correction capability at low snr.
@result economic evaluation of sequencing strategies in her2-positive metastatic breast cancer in mexico: a contrast between public and private payer perspectives abstractpurpose based on available phase iii trial data, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different treatment strategies that can be used in patients with newly diagnosed her2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mbc).patients and methodswe constructed a markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four different her2 targeted treatment sequences in patients with her2-positive mbc treated in the u.s. the model followed patients weekly over their remaining life expectancies. health states considered were progression-free survival (pfs) 1st to 3rd lines, and death. transitional probabilities were based on published phase iii trials. cost data (2015 us dollars) were captured from the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) drug payment table and physician fee schedule. health utility data were extracted from published studies. the outcomes considered were pfs, os, costs, qalys, the incremental cost per qaly gained ratio, and the net monetary benefit. deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty around key model parameters and their joint impact on the base-case results.resultsthe combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (thp) as first-line therapy, trastuzumab emtansine (t-dm1) as second-line therapy, and lapatinib/capecitabine third-line resulted in 1.81 qalys, at a cost of $335,231.35. the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent t-dm1 or pertuzumab yielded 1.41 qalys, at a cost of $175,240.69. the least clinically effective sequence (1.27 qalys), but most cost-effective at a total cost of $149,250.19, was trastuzumab/docetaxel as first-line therapy, t-dm1 as second-line therapy, and trastuzumab/lapatinib as third-line therapy.conclusionour results suggest that thp as first-line therapy, followed by t-dm1 as second-line therapy, would require at least a 50 % reduction in the total drug acquisition cost for it to be considered a cost-effective strategy.
@background pharmacology of src family kinases and therapeutic implications of their modulators locoregional and distant recurrence remains common and usually fatal for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). one promising molecular target in hnscc is the src family kinases (sfk). sfks can affect cellular proliferation and survival by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) family of transcription factors, especially stat3. surprisingly, sustained sfk inhibition resulted in only transient inhibition of stat3. we investigated the mechanism underlying stat3 activation and its biological importance. specific c-src knockdown with small interfering rna (sirna) resulted in stat3 activation showing specificity, which was inhibited by janus-activated kinase (jak; tyk2 and jak2) depletion with sirna. sustained sfk inhibition also resulted in recovered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity after an initial reduction, although jak phosphorylation paradoxically decreased. to determine the biological significance of stat3 activation, we combined specific stat3 depletion with a pharmacologic sfk inhibitor and observed increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. likewise, the addition of stat3- or jak-specific sirna to c-src-depleted cells enhanced cytotoxicity relative to cells incubated with c-src sirna alone. these results show that reactivation of stat3 after sustained, specific c-src inhibition is mediated through altered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity and that this compensatory pathway allows for cancer cell survival and proliferation despite durable c-src inhibition. to our knowledge, this novel feedback pathway has never been described previously. given that pharmacologic sfk inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, these results have potential clinical implications for cancer therapy.
@method efficient exon skipping of sgcg mutations mediated by phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. backgroundcellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor myod has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.resultswe now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. we show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using crispr/cas9 technology.conclusionswith progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.
@method social determinants of health in the united states: addressing major health inequality trends for the nation, 1935-2016 background there is limited research on rural-urban disparities in u.s. life expectancy.   purpose this study examined trends in rural-urban disparities in life expectancy at birth in the u.s. between 1969 and 2009.   methods the 1969-2009 u.s. county-level mortality data linked to a rural-urban continuum measure were analyzed. life expectancies were calculated by age, gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969 and 2004 and for 2005-2009 using standard life-table methodology. differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of death.   results life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. in 2005-2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural areas. when stratified by gender, race, and income, life expectancy ranged from 67.7 years among poor black men in nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor asian/pacific islander women in metropolitan areas. rural-urban disparities widened over time. in 1969-1971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). by 2005-2009, the life expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years). the rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival probabilities that urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades earlier. causes of death contributing most to the increasing rural-urban disparity and lower life expectancy in rural areas include heart disease, unintentional injuries, copd, lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and diabetes.   conclusions between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas experienced larger gains in life expectancy than those in nonmetropolitan areas, contributing to the widening gap.
@background cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adult congenital heart disease. as the longevity of patients with congenital heart disease improves, the number surviving to adulthood will continue to rise. consequently, practicing physicians can expect to encounter an increasing number of adult patients with various congenital cardiac conditions. impaired exercise tolerance in this patient population is exceptionally common; adult patients with congenital heart disease have reduced exercise capacity compared with healthy, age-matched counterparts. the different methods of evaluating exercise capacity, the characteristic physiologic abnormalities encountered in patients with various congenital cardiac conditions, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that may account for these abnormalities, and the clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
@background androgen-dependent apoptosis in male germ cells is regulated through the proto-oncoprotein cbl mechanisms of androgen-induced thymic involution are largely undefined. we have found that significant decreases in thymic size occur 2-4 h after a dose of testosterone is administered to castrated male mice. this rapid rate of change suggests a role for androgen-induced apoptosis in modulating the size and composition of the thymus. using thymic organ cultures to define these effects of androgens, we found that dihydrotestosterone treatment of thymus tissues from females or from castrated males results in enhancement of thymocyte apoptosis. intact (androgen-replete) or testicular feminization, tfm/y (androgen-resistant) mice failed to show apoptotic change with androgen treatment, although the apoptotic response to glucocorticoids was present, suggesting a requirement for a functional androgen receptor. acceleration of thymocyte apoptosis by androgens may mediate processes of thymocyte selection, with the potential to impart gender-specific characteristics on the peripheral t cell repertoire.
@method cardiovascular effects of tramadol in dogs anesthetized with sevoflurane. objective to compare morphine with tramadol for the management of early postoperative pain following ovariohysterectomy after pyometra in dogs.   study design prospective randomized blinded clinical trial.   animals thirty female dogs, 2-14 years old.   methods animals were randomly divided into two equal groups. group 1 received 0.2 mg kg-1 of morphine iv and group 2 received 2 mg kg-1 of tramadol iv after the induction of anesthesia. the dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, and anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and ketamine. isoflurane was used for the maintenance of anesthesia. the variables measured were: analgesia; sedation; cardiac and respiratory rates; arterial blood pressure; end-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide (pe'co2); oxyhemoglobin saturation (spo2); plasma catecholamines; serum cortisol and glucose concentrations; ph and blood gases. the animals were monitored for 6 hours after the administration of the analgesic agent.   results there were no differences between the two groups with regard to analgesia, sedation, spo2, ph and blood gases, cardiovascular variables, glucose, catecholamine and cortisol concentrations. forty minutes postopioid administration, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the morphine-treated group as compared to the tramadol group. at 30 minutes following opioid injection, pe'co2 was significantly higher in the morphine group than in the tramadol group. two dogs in the tramadol group and one in the morphine group were given morphine postoperatively because of increasing pain scores.   conclusion and clinical relevance morphine and tramadol, administered preemptively can be used safely in dogs to control early pain after ovariohysterectomy without significant adverse effects.
@background variability of motoneuron activation and the modulation of force production in a postural reflex of the hermit crab abdomen cuticular strain associated with support of the shell of the hermit crab, pagurus pollicarus, by its abdomen activates mechanoreceptors that evoke a stereotyped reflex in postural motoneurons. this reflex consists of three phases: a brief high-frequency burst of motoneuron spikes, a pause, and a much longer duration but lower frequency period of spiking. these phases are correlated with a rapid increase in muscle force followed by a slight decline to a level of tone that is greater than that at rest but less than maximal. the present experiments address the mechanisms underlying the transition from the first to second phase of the reflex and their role in force generation. although centrally generated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (ipsps) are present during the pause period of the reflex, intracellular current injection of motoneurons reveals a spike frequency adaptation that rapidly and substantially reduces motoneuron firing frequency and is unchanged in saline that reduces synaptic transmission. the adaptation is voltage sensitive and persists for several hundred milliseconds upon repolarization. hyperpolarization partially restores the initial response of the motoneuron to depolarizing current. spike frequency adaptation and synaptic inhibition are important mechanisms in the generation of force that maintains abdominal stiffness at a constant, submaximal level.
@background analysis of the effects of alterations in the tick-borne encephalitis virus 3'-noncoding region on translation and rna replication using reporter replicons. abstract we have developed a reporting replicon of west nile virus (wnv) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and rna replication. a renilla luciferase (rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in rlucrep. transfection of bhk cells with rlucrep rna yielded two distinctive rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. by contrast, only the 2- to 10-h rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase ns5 (rlucrep-ns5mt). immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and rna replication increased in cells transfected with the rlucrep but not in those transfected with the rlucrep-ns5mt. these results suggest that the rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents rna replication. using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (cs) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect wnv translation but severely diminished or completely abolished rna replication. mutations of cs1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′cs) abolished rna replication. restoration of the 5′cs-cs1 interaction rescued viral replication. replicons containing individual deletions of cs2, repeated cs2 (rcs2), cs3, or rcs3 were viable, but their rna replication was dramatically compromised. these results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′cs-cs1 interaction is essential for wnv rna replication, whereas cs2, rcs2, cs3, and rcs3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, wnv replication.
@result luminal b subtype: a key factor for the worse prognosis of young breast cancer patients in china background breast cancer rarely occurs in young women. our knowledge about disease presentation, prognosis and treatment effects are largely dependent upon older series.   materials and methods we evaluated biological features and stage at presentation for 1427 consecutive premenopausal patients aged < or = 50 years with first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer referred to surgery at the european institute of oncology from april 1997 to august 2000. a total of 185 patients (13%) were aged < 35 years ('very young') and 1242 (87%) were aged 35-50 years ('less young'). the expression of estrogen receptors (er), progesterone receptors (pgr), presence of vascular invasion (vi), grading (g), expression of ki-67, her2/neu overexpression, pathological stage according to tnm staging system (ptnm), pathological tumor size and number of axillary lymph node involvement were evaluated.   results compared with less young patients, the very young patient group had a higher percentage of tumors classified as er negative (p < 0.001), pgr negative (p = 0.001), higher expression of ki-67 > or = 20% of cells stained; 62.2% versus 53%, (p < 0.001), vascular or lymphatic invasion (48.6% versus 37.3%, p = 0.006), and pathological grade 3 (p < 0.0001). there was no difference between the two groups for pt, pathological tumor size (pn) and number of positive lymph nodes.   conclusions we conclude that compared with less young premenopausal patients, very young women have a greater chance of having an endocrine-unresponsive tumor, and are more likely to present with a higher grade, more extensively proliferating and vessel invading disease. pathological tumor size, nodal status and number of positive axillary lymph-nodes have a similar distribution among the younger and the older cohorts, thus not supporting previous data indicating more advanced disease in younger patients at diagnosis of operable disease.
@background cd13 and ror2 permit isolation of highly enriched cardiac mesoderm from differentiating human embryonic stem cells objective heterogeneity of action potential configuration in the left ventricle (lv), and the contribution of m cells to it, has been observed in the human heart and is important for arrhythmogenesis. whether the pig heart has similar properties remains a controversial but important issue as the pig heart is currently under study for use in xenotransplantation.   methods single myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the epicardium (epi, ncells = 29), midmyocardium (mid, ncells = 38), and endocardium (endo, ncells = 13) of the free lv wall (npigs = 26, 14-22 weeks old, 55-80 kg), and studied at different stimulation rates during whole-cell recording (normal tyrode's solution, k(+)-aspartate-based pipette solution, 50 microm k5fluo-3 as [ca2+]i indicator, 37 degrees c). standard six-lead ecgs were recorded from anesthetized pigs.   results the action potential duration (apd) was not significantly different at 0.25 hz vs. 2 hz for the majority of cells in all three layers. however, a subpopulation of cells behaved like m cells and had a very steep frequency response (apd90 at 0.25 hz 538 +/- 30 ms, vs. 337 +/- 9 ms at 2 hz, p < 0.05, n = 22). these cells were found predominantly in the mid layer (34% of cells), but also (24%) in epi. m cells had a more pronounced spike-and-dome configuration, with a significantly larger phase 1 magnitude and plateau voltage. the frequency response of these parameters was different from the other cell types. [ca2+]i transients tended to be larger in m cells. for the in vivo ecg of anesthetized pigs, the qt time was close to the apd90 of m cells, and j waves were seen in 7/12 recordings.   conclusions in young adult pigs, m cells can be identified by a steep frequency response of the apd and by a spike-and-dome configuration. these cells are mostly, but not exclusively, found in the midmyocardium, and could contribute to the ecg characteristics. their properties may however be different from those of other species, including humans.
@background evaluation of heavy metal pollution in water wells and soil using common leafy green plant indicators in the al-kharj region, saudi arabia the present study was carried out to assess levels of different heavy metals like iron, cadmium, nickel, lead, copper and zinc in vegetables irrigated with water from different sources industrial area of naini allahabad. the order of heavy metal concentration was found in fe > zn > cd > pb > ni > cu in irrigated water and fe > ni > zn > cu > cd > pb was observed in industrial contaminated sites of soils. metal levels observed in these sources were compared with who. the concentrations (mg/l) of heavy metals in irrigated water ranged from 0.249 to 0.257 for fe, 0.049 to 0.056 for zn, 0.028 to 0.036 for cd, 0.015 to 0.019 for cu, 0.035 to 0.042 for pb and 0.031 to 0.038 for ni which is lower than recommended maximum tolerable levels proposed by joint fao/who expert committee on food additives (2007), with the exception of cd and fe which exhibited elevated content. uptake and translocation factor of heavy metal from soil to edible parts of vegetables were quite distinguished for almost all elements examined. although the practice of growing leafy vegetables using wastewater for irrigation is aimed at producing socio-economic benefits but study reveals that heavy metal-contaminated vegetables grown in wastewater-irrigated areas may pose public health hazards which is not safe and may not be sustainable in the long-term.
@result influence of sediment composition on pah toxicity using zebrafish (danio rerio) and japanese medaka (oryzias latipes) embryo-larval assays neuroactive small molecules are indispensable tools for treating mental illnesses and dissecting nervous system function. however, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. here, we describe a high—throughput (ht) behavior—based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. we use automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and find that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules cause distinct patterns of behavior. these `behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify novel psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. for example, we identify novel acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. by combining ht screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior—based chemical screens may accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small—molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior.
@background anterior cervical interbody fusion with radiolucent carbon fiber cages: clinical and radiological results. the aim of this work was to add to the body of data on the frequency and severity of degenerative radiographic findings at adjacent levels after anterior cervical interbody fusion and on their clinical impact and to contribute to the insights about their pathogenesis. one hundred eighty patients who were treated by anterior cervical interbody fusion and who had a follow-up of >60 months were clinically and radiologically examined by independent investigators. for all patients, the long-term odom score was compared with the score as obtained 6 weeks after surgery. for myelopathic cases, both the late nurick and the odom score were compared with the initial postoperative situation. for the adjacent disc levels, a radiologic “degeneration score” was defined and assessed both initially and at long-term follow-up. at late follow-up after anterior cervical interbody fusion, additional radiologic degeneration at the adjacent disc levels was found in 92% of the cases, often reflecting a clinical deterioration. the severity of this additional degeneration correlated with the time interval since surgery. the similarity of progression to degeneration between younger trauma patients and older nontrauma patients suggests that both the biomechanical impact of the interbody fusion and the natural progression of pre-existing degenerative disease act as triggering factors for adjacent level degeneration.
@background the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on mitochondrial superoxide and glucocorticoid-induced hypertension diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the united states. despite several studies indicating a role for mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of diabetic complications, the precise mechanisms underlying renal mitochondrial dysfunction and renal cell injury remain unclear. the hypothesis of the current study was that high-glucose-mediated generation of mitochondrial superoxide is a key early event that leads to mitochondrial injury in renal proximal tubular cells. to ascertain the role of mitochondrial superoxide we have tested whether overexpression of the primary mitochondrial antioxidant, manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod), protects against hyperglycemia-induced renal injury using normal rat renal proximal tubular cells (nrk). nrk cells were exposed to high glucose (25 mm) and the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, atp levels, and superoxide generation and the loss of cell viability were measured at 24 and 48 h after high glucose exposure. our results indicate that high glucose first induced superoxide generation and hyperpolarization in the mitochondria, followed by a secondary event, which involved a decline in atp levels, partial complex iii inactivation, and loss of cell viability. these high-glucose-induced changes were completely prevented by overexpression of mnsod in nrk cells. however, mnsod activity was not changed after high glucose exposure in vitro or during the early stages of diabetes using the streptozotocin rat model. these findings show for the first time that hyperglycemic induction of superoxide production within the mitochondria initiates specific mitochondrial injury (i.e., complex iii) via a mechanism independent of mnsod inactivation.
@background prediction of the onset of disturbed eating behavior in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes objective to characterize the relationship of subclinical and clinical eating disorders to hba1c values in women with iddm. research design and methods ninety women with iddm (18–46 years of age) were recruited from diabetes clinics throughout connecticut and massachusetts. subjects were categorized into one of three groups according to the diagnostic statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-iii-r) criteria for eating disorders as follows: the clinical group (n = 14), the subclinical group (partially fulfilling the diagnostic criteria; n = 13), and the control group (n = 63). group differences in the degree of dietary restraint, binge eating, and bulimic behaviors and weight, shape, and eating concerns were assessed with the eating disorder examination (ede) and the bulimia test revised (bulit-r). results women with subclinical and clinical eating disorders had clinically elevated hba1c results and more diabetes-related complications, compared with the control subjects. the severity of bulimic behaviors, weight concerns, reduced bmi, and decreased frequency of blood glucose monitoring were associated with elevated hba1c. conclusions hba1c may have clinical utility in the identification of eating disorder behavior in females with iddm. health care professionals should be aware of the potent effect of subclinical and clinical eating behaviors including insulin misuse in weight-conscious women with iddm who have poor glycemic control.
@method the relationships between self-rated health and serum lipids across time background the purpose of this study is to test whether the predictive power of an individual's self-rated health (srh) on subsequent mortality risk differs by socioeconomic status (ses) in the united states.   methods we use the national health interview survey 1986-94 linked to multiple cause of death files 1986-97 (nhis-mcd). analyses are based on non-hispanic black and white adults 25 and older (n = 358,388). cox proportional hazard models are used to estimate the effect of srh on mortality risk during follow-up. interactions of srh and level of education and srh and level of income are used to assess differences in the predictive power of srh for subsequent mortality risk.   results the effect of srh on subsequent mortality risk differs by level of education and level of income. lower health ratings are more strongly associated with mortality for adults with higher education and/or higher income relative to their lower ses counterparts.   conclusions our findings suggest that individuals with different education or income levels may evaluate their health differently with respect to the traditional five-point srh scale, and hence their subjective health ratings may not be directly comparable. these results have important implications for research that tries to quantify and explain socioeconomic inequalities in health based on self-rated health.
@background improving recorded volume in mesial temporal lobe by optimizing stereotactic intracranial electrode implantation planning purposeboth frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (dbs) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on mr-imaging data. we propose and validate a method for computer-assisted dbs trajectory planning.methodour framework integrates multi-modal mri analysis (t1w, swi, tof-mra) to compute suitable dbs trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. a cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. the framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection.resultsthe proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. a retrospective analysis on 14 dbs cases of patients with severe parkinson’s disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation.conclusionsthis work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of dbs lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.
@background clinical correlations with porphyromonas gingivalis antibody responses in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis introductionthe association between rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and periodontitis is suggested to be linked to the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. colonization of p. gingivalis in the oral cavity of ra patients has been scarcely considered. to further explore whether the association between periodontitis and ra is dependent on p. gingivalis, we compared host immune responses in ra patients with and without periodontitis in relation to presence of cultivable p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.methodsin 95 ra patients, the periodontal condition was examined using the dutch periodontal screening index for treatment needs. subgingival plaque samples were tested for presence of p. gingivalis by anaerobic culture technique. iga, igg and igm antibody titers to p. gingivalis were measured by elisa. serum and subgingival plaque measures were compared to a matched control group of non-ra subjects.resultsa higher prevalence of severe periodontitis was observed in ra patients in comparison to matched non-ra controls (27% versus 12%, p < 0.001). ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher das28 scores than ra patients with no or moderate periodontitis (p < 0.001), while no differences were seen in igm-rf or acpa reactivity. furthermore, ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher igg- and igm-anti p. gingivalis titers than non-ra controls with severe periodontitis (p < 0.01 resp. p < 0.05), although subgingival occurrence of p. gingivalis was not different.conclusionsseverity of periodontitis is related to severity of ra. ra patients with severe periodontitis have a more robust antibody response against p. gingivalis than non-ra controls, but not all ra patients have cultivable p. gingivalis.

@method bootstrapping monte carlo tree search with an imperfect heuristic the uct algorithm learns a value function online using sample-based search. the td(λ) algorithm can learn a value function offline for the on-policy distribution. we consider three approaches for combining offline and online value functions in the uct algorithm. first, the offline value function is used as a default policy during monte-carlo simulation. second, the uct value function is combined with a rapid online estimate of action values. third, the offline value function is used as prior knowledge in the uct search tree. we evaluate these algorithms in 9 x 9 go against gnugo 3.7.10. the first algorithm performs better than uct with a random simulation policy, but surprisingly, worse than uct with a weaker, handcrafted simulation policy. the second algorithm outperforms uct altogether. the third algorithm outperforms uct with handcrafted prior knowledge. we combine these algorithms in mogo, the world's strongest 9 x 9 go program. each technique significantly improves mogo's playing strength.
@background anaplasma phagocytophilum asp14 is an invasin that interacts with mammalian host cells via its c terminus to facilitate infection anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehrlichia chaffeensis and ehrlichia ewingii are emerging tick-borne pathogens and are the causative agents of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and e. ewingii ehrlichiosis, respectively. collectively, these are referred to as human ehrlichioses. these obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the family anaplasmataceae are transmitted by ixodes spp. or amblyomma americanum ticks and infect peripherally circulating leukocytes to cause infections that range in clinical spectra from asymptomatic seroconversion to mild, severe or, in rare instances, fatal disease. this review describes: the ecology of each pathogen; the epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms of the human diseases that each causes; the choice methods for diagnosing and treating human ehrlichioses; recommendations for patient management; and is concluded with suggestions for potential future research.
@method full dynamic interchangeability with forward checking and arc consistency we introduce a new method, called symmetry excluding search (ses), for excluding symmetries in constraint based search. to our knowledge, it is the first declarative method that can be applied to arbitrary symmetries. the ses-method is based on the notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our modification of a general constraint based search algorithm. the method does not influence the search strategy. furthermore, it can be used with either the full set of symmetries, or a subset of all symmetries.we proof correctness, completeness and symmetry exclusion properties of our method. then, we show how to apply the ses-method in the special case of geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and permutation symmetries. furthermore, we give results from practical applications.
@background pre-transplant donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies are associated with high risk of delayed graft function after renal transplantation. delayed graft function (dgf) is a common complication of deceased donor kidney transplantation with negative impact on clinical outcomes. in a single‐center retrospective analysis, we compared patient and kidney survival, early renal function, and the incidence of acute rejection during the first year among all adult deceased donor kidney transplant patients without dgf, with dgf requiring one‐time and/or more than one‐time dialysis treatment between january 1, 2000, and december 31, 2008. of 831 adult kidney transplant patients, 74 (8.9%) required one‐time and 134 (16.1%) more than one‐time dialysis treatment post‐transplantation, respectively. while dgf patients with one‐time dialysis treatment had comparable clinical outcomes to that of patients without dgf, patients with dgf requiring more than one‐time dialysis treatment had a 45% increased risk for death (hr 1.45, 95% ci 1.02, 2.05, p = 0.04) after adjustment for the differences in demographic and baseline characteristics. furthermore, dgf patients with more than one‐time dialysis requirement displayed significantly lower renal function after recovery (or 0.32, 95% ci 0.21, 0.49, p < 0.001, for egfr ≥ 60 ml/min) and higher incidence of acute rejection during the first year (or 1.66, 95% ci 1.11, 2.49, p = 0.015). additional studies of therapeutic approaches to manage patients with prolonged dgf are needed.
@background sparsity constrained sinogram inpainting for metal artifact reduction in x-ray computed tomography traditional computed tomography (ct) reconstructions of total joint prostheses are limited by metal artifacts from corrupted projection data. published metal artifact reduction methods are based on the assumption that severe attenuation of x-rays by prostheses renders corresponding portions of projection data unavailable, hence the "missing" data are either avoided (in iterative reconstruction) or interpolated (in filtered back-projection with data completion; typically, with filling data "gaps" via linear functions). here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. the wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. as compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses. this superior imaging precision is highly advantageous in geometric modeling for fitting hip prostheses.
@method stat is an essential activator of the zygotic genome in the early drosophila embryo stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) is a potent transcription factor and its aberrant activation by phosphorylation is associated with human cancers. we have shown previously that overactivation of jak, which phosphorylates stat, disrupts heterochromatin formation globally in drosophila melanogaster. however, it remains unclear how this effect is mediated and whether stat is involved. here, we demonstrate that drosophila stat (stat92e) is involved in controlling heterochromatin protein 1 (hp1) distribution and heterochromatin stability. we found, unexpectedly, that loss of stat92e, had the same effects as overactivation of jak in disrupting heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpression of stat92e had the opposite effects. we have further shown that the unphosphorylated or 'transcriptionally inactive' form of stat92e is localized on heterochromatin in association with hp1, and is required for stabilizing hp1 localization and histone h3 lys 9 methylation (h3mk9) . however, activation by phosphorylation reduces heterochromatin-associated stat92e, causing hp1 displacement and heterochromatin destabilization. thus, reducing levels of unphosphorylated stat92e, either by loss of stat92e or increased phosphorylation, causes heterochromatin instability. these results suggest that activation of stat by phosphorylation controls both access to chromatin and activity of the transcription machinery.
@background explaining software developer acceptance of methodologies: a comparison of five theoretical models success at attempted weight reduction among college women was predicted on the basis of a theory of planned behavior. at the beginning of a 6-week period, participants expressed their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and intentions with respect to losing weight. in addition, the extent to which they had made detailed weight reduction plans was assessed, as were a number of general attitudes and personality factors. in support of the theory, intentions to lose weight were accurately predicted on the basis of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control; perceived control and intentions were together moderately successful in predicting the amount of weight that participants actually lost over the 6-week period. actual weight loss was also found to increase with development of a plan and with ego strength, factors that were assumed to increase control over goal attainment. other factors, such as health locus of control, perceived competence, and action control, were found to be unrelated to weight reduction.
@method loss of genetic connectivity and diversity in urban microreserves in a southern california endemic jerusalem cricket (orthoptera: stenopelmatidae: stenopelmatus n. sp. “santa monica”) with the aim of analyzing and interpreting data on dna polymorphism obtained by dna sequencing or restriction enzyme technique, a mathematical theory on the expected evolutionary relationship among dna sequences (nucleons) sampled is developed under the assumption that the evolutionary change of nucleons is determined solely by mutation and random genetic drift. the statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. these studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors. therefore, increasing sample size does not help reduce the variance significantly the distribution of sample allele (nucleomorph) frequencies is also studied, and it is shown that a small number of samples are sufficient in order to know the distribution pattern.
@background a novel mechanism for nicotinic potentiation of glutamatergic synapses activity-dependent gene expression is essential for form and function in the nervous system. best understood is the role of glutamatergic signaling in controlling such events, but nicotinic signaling can also regulate transcription. we show here that nicotine can alter gene expression in rat hippocampal neurons, as reflected by activation of the transcription factor creb and appearance of the immediate early gene product c-fos. the process depends on both cam and map kinases and on calcium release from internal stores. part of the nicotinic effect is mediated via glutamatergic transmission, even in the absence of action potentials. voltage-gated calcium channels are not necessary for nicotine-induced activation of creb in hippocampal neurons. the low levels of sustained nicotinic stimulation required for transcriptional effects are consistent with those likely to be achievable either by the normal septal cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus or by repeated tobacco usage.
@result gorillas with white sclera: a naturally occurring variation in a morphological trait linked to social cognitive functions making eye contact is the most powerful mode of establishing a communicative link between humans. during their first year of life, infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. two experiments were carried out to demonstrate special sensitivity to direct eye contact from birth. the first experiment tested the ability of 2- to 5-day-old newborns to discriminate between direct and averted gaze. in the second experiment, we measured 4-month-old infants' brain electric activity to assess neural processing of faces when accompanied by direct (as opposed to averted) eye gaze. the results show that, from birth, human infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze. the exceptionally early sensitivity to mutual gaze demonstrated in these studies is arguably the major foundation for the later development of social skills.
@method adaptive computation time for recurrent neural networks we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
@background mechanisms of postinhibitory rebound and its modulation by serotonin in excitatory swim motor neurons of the medicinal leech bath application of dopamine modifies the rhythmic motor pattern generated by the 14 neuron pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, panulirus interruptus. among other effects, dopamine excites many of the pyloric constrictor (py) neurons to fire at high frequency and phase-advances the timing of their activity in the motor pattern. these responses arise in part from direct actions of dopamine to modulate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the py cells, and can be studied in synaptically isolated neurons. the rate of rebound following a hyperpolarizing prestep and the spike frequency during a subsequent depolarization are both accelerated by dopamine. based on theoretical simulations, hartline (1979) suggested that the rate of postinhibitory rebound in stomatogastric neurons could vary with the amount of voltage- sensitive transient potassium current (ia). consistent with this prediction, we found that dopamine evokes a net conductance decrease in synaptically isolated py neurons. in voltage clamp, dopamine reduces ia, specifically by reducing the amplitude of the slowly inactivating component of the current and shifting its voltage activation curve in the depolarized direction. 4-aminopyridine, a selective blocker of ia in stomatogastric neurons, mimics and occludes the effects of dopamine on isolated py neurons. a conductance-based mathematical model of the py neuron shows appropriate changes in activity upon quantitative modification of the ia parameters affected by dopamine. these results demonstrate that dopamine excites and phase-advances the py neurons in the rhythmic pyloric motor pattern at least in part by reducing the transient k+ current, ia.
@background activation of grs–akt–nnos–nr2b signaling pathway by second dose gr agonist contributes to exacerbated hyperalgesia in a rat model of radicular pain objective to determine the effectiveness and predictors of response to lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections (esi) in patients with sciatica. we performed a 12-month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in four secondary pain-care clinics in the wessex region.   methods two hundred and twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica of 1-18 months' duration were randomized to either three lumbar esis of triamcinolone acetonide or interligamentous saline injections at intervals of 3 weeks. the main outcome measure was the oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (odq).   results at 3 weeks, the esi group demonstrated a transient benefit over the placebo group (patients achieving a 75% improvement in odq, 12.5 vs 3.7%; number needed to treat, 11.4). no benefit was demonstrated from 6 to 52 weeks. esis did not improve physical function, hasten return to work or reduce the need for surgery. there was no benefit of repeated esis over single injection. no clinical predictors of response were found. at the end of the study the majority of patients still had significant pain and disability regardless of intervention.   conclusions in this pragmatic study, esis offered transient benefit in symptoms at 3 weeks in patients with sciatica, but no sustained benefits in terms of pain, function or need for surgery. sciatica is a chronic condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. to fully investigate the value of esis, they need to be evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary approach.
@background haemocyte apoptosis of the tiger shrimp penaeus monodon exposed to cadmium lack of shrimp cell lines has hindered the study of pollutants which adversely affects shrimp health and its export value. in this context a primary haemocyte culture developed from penaeus monodon was employed for assessing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of two heavy metal compounds, cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and two organophosphate insecticides, malathion and monocrotophos. using mtt assay 12 h ic(50) values calculated were 31.09 ± 16.27 μm and 5.52 ± 1.16 μm for cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and 59.94 ± 52.30 mg l(-1) and 186.76 ± 77.00 mg l(-1) for malathion and monocrotophos respectively. employing comet assay, dna damage inflicted by these pollutants on haemocytes were evaluated and the pollutants induced dna damage in >60% of the cells. the study suggested that haemocyte culture could be used as a tool for quantifying cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of aquaculture drugs, management chemicals and pollutants.
@background the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
@method identification of novel pikfyve gene mutations associated with fleck corneal dystrophy genetic polymorphisms are often considered as risk factors of complex diseases serving as valuable and easily detectable biomarkers, also stable during the whole lifespan. a novel type of genetic polymorphism has been identified just recently, referred to as gene copy number variation (cnv) or copy number polymorphism. cnv of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and its adjacent gene, nr1i2 (pregnane x receptor isoform), has been reported to associate with bipolar depression. in our study we introduced multicapillary electrophoresis for gene copy number analysis as an affordable alternative to real‐time pcr quantification with taqman gene probes. our results show the reliability of the developed method based on conventional pcr followed by separation of products by multicapillary electrophoresis with quantitative evaluation. this method can be readily implemented for the analysis of candidate gene cnvs in high throughput clinical laboratories and also in personalized medicine care of depression‐related risk factors.
@method waveseq: a novel data-driven method of detecting histone modification enrichments using wavelets a practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the el nino–southern oscillation (enso). the guide includes a comparison to the windowed fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and fourier frequency. new statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. it is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. the statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of change...
@background master thesis opponent report background and related work grounded theory, as an evolving qualitative research method, is a product of its history as well as of its epistemology. within the literature, there have been a number of discussions focusing on the differences between glaser's (1978, 1992) and strauss's (1987, 1990) versions of grounded theory. the purpose of this article is to add a level of depth and breadth to this discussion through specifically exploring the glaser-strauss debate by comparing the data analysis processes and procedures advocated by glaser and by strauss. to accomplish this task, the authors present the article in two sections. first, they provide relevant background information on grounded theory as a research method. second, they pursue a more in-depth discussion of the positions of glaser, using glaser's work, and strauss, using strauss's and strauss and corbin's (1990) work, regarding the different phases of data analysis, specifically addressing the coding procedures, verification, and the issue of forcing versus emergence.
@method biased subspace learning for misalignment-robust facial expression recognition we propose an appearance-based face recognition method called the laplacianface approach. by using locality preserving projections (lpp), the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. different from principal component analysis (pca) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) which effectively see only the euclidean structure of face space, lpp finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. the laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the laplace beltrami operator on the face manifold. in this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. theoretical analysis shows that pca, lda, and lpp can be obtained from different graph models. we compare the proposed laplacianface approach with eigenface and fisherface methods on three different face data sets. experimental results suggest that the proposed laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition.

@method dense 3d regression for hand pose estimation we present a novel method for real-time continuous pose recovery of markerless complex articulable objects from a single depth image. our method consists of the following stages: a randomized decision forest classifier for image segmentation, a robust method for labeled dataset generation, a convolutional network for dense feature extraction, and finally an inverse kinematics stage for stable real-time pose recovery. as one possible application of this pipeline, we show state-of-the-art results for real-time puppeteering of a skinned hand-model.
@result neurone specific enolase (nse) in small cell lung cancer: a tumour marker of prognostic significance? among lung cancers small cell carcinoma is the most sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. this has emphasised the importance of an accurate diagnosis of this cell type, and the present study examined the use of serum neurone specific enolase (nse) as a diagnostic marker for small cell carcinoma. nse was measured in pretreatment sera from 103 patients with small cell carcinoma and in sera from relevant controls, including patients with other lung cancers, non-malignant lung diseases, and healthy adults. serum nse concentration was raised (greater than 25 ng/ml) in 72% of patients with small cell carcinoma. ninety one per cent of patients with extensive disease and 50% of patients with limited disease were serum nse positive. patients with extensive disease in general had higher serum nse concentrations than patients with limited disease. no definite difference in serum nse positivity could be shown between oat cell and intermediate cell subtypes. out of 51 patients with other lung cancers, four (8%) had a raised serum concentration, whereas all patients with non-malignant diseases and healthy individuals had normal serum nse concentrations. serum nse determination seems to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
@method glycosphingolipid gm3 is indispensable for dengue virus genome replication replicon systems have been used for high-throughput screening of anti-dengue virus (anti-denv) inhibitors and for understanding mechanisms of viral replication. in the present study, we constructed novel denv-1 replicons encoding gaussia luciferase that was secreted into the culture medium. two types of constructs were generated: rna-based and dna-based. each type was translated in an internal ribosome entry site (ires)-dependent or ires-independent manner. among these constructs, the dna-based replicon employing ires-dependent translation (dgl2) produced the highest titer. luciferase levels in the culture medium revealed that the dgl2 replicon was inhibited by ribavirin (a well-known denv inhibitor) at levels similar to those measured for drug inhibition of multi-round denv-1 infection. these results indicate that the dna-based ires-driven denv-1 replicon may facilitate studies on viral replication and antiviral compound discovery.
@method the nin transcription factor coordinates diverse nodulation programs in different tissues of the medicago truncatula root[open] lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation factors (nfs) secreted by endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia trigger ca2+ spiking in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region of host legume root hairs. to determine whether nfs also elicit ca2+ responses within the plant cell nucleus we have made use of a nucleoplasmin-tagged cameleon (nupyc2.1). confocal microscopy using this nuclear-specific calcium reporter has revealed sustained and regular ca2+ spiking within the nuclear compartment of medicago truncatula root hairs treated with sinorhizobium meliloti nfs. since the activation of ca2+ oscillations is blocked in m. truncatula nfp, dmi1, and dmi2 mutants, and unaltered in a dmi3 background, it is likely that intranuclear spiking lies on the established nf-dependent signal transduction pathway, leading to cytoplasmic calcium spiking. a semiautomated mathematical procedure has been developed to identify and analyze nuclear ca2+ spiking profiles, and has revealed high cell-to-cell variability in terms of both periodicity and spike duration. time-lapse imaging of the cameleon förster resonance energy transfer-based ratio has allowed us to visualize the nuclear spiking variability in situ and to demonstrate the absence of spiking synchrony between adjacent growing root hairs. finally, spatio-temporal analysis of the asymmetric nuclear spike suggests that the initial rapid increase in ca2+ concentration occurs principally in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope. the discovery that rhizobial nf perception leads to the activation of cell-autonomous ca2+ oscillations on both sides of the nuclear envelope raises major questions about the respective roles of the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in transducing this key endosymbiotic signal.
@background ex-vivo α-galactosylceramide activation of nkt cells in humans and macaques. flow cytometry has become a powerful technique to measure intracellular cytokine production in lymphocytes and monocytes. appropriate inhibition of the secretion of the produced cytokines is required for studying intracellular cytokine expression. the aim of this study was to compare the capacity of cytokine secretion inhibitors, monensin and brefeldin a, in order to trap cytokine production (interleukin-1 beta [il-1beta], il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [tnf-alpha]) within peripheral blood monocytes. a two-color flow cytometric technique was used to measure intracellular spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha production in monocytes (cd14+) of whole blood cultures. the viability of monensin-treated monocytes was slightly lower than that of brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes, as measured with propidium iodide (pi). the percentage of il-6 and tnf-alpha-producing monocytes after 8 h of culture without stimulation revealed significant lower values for monensin-treated than for brefeldin a-treated monocytes. the percentages for stimulated cells did not differ. the spontaneous intracellular production in molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome units (mesf) of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha after 8 h of culture was higher in brefeldin a than in monensin-inhibited monocytes. the lps-stimulated intracellular production of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha was increased in brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes. in conclusion, for flow cytometric determination of intracellular monocytic cytokines (il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha), brefeldin a is a more potent, effective, and less toxic inhibitor of cytokine secretion than monensin.
@method a semantic negotiation model for service property value between service agents the agent metaphor has shown its usefulness for modelling as well as implementing complex and dynamic applications. although a number of agent applications has been successfully realised and used, it must be stated that the distribution of commercial off-the-shelf applications is very scarce. for this discontenting situation, at least two reasons can be identified. on the one hand, the development of agent-based applications is difficult suffering from insufficient standards and tools and on the other hand deployment issues are little researched and supported. in this paper, several deployment-related topics are discussed and a vision for the deployment of distributed multi-agent systems is conceived. from the vision, requirements for launching and configuring agent applications are derived. according to these requirements, a platform independent reference model of the proposed deployment infrastructure is presented. the reference model provides the basis for the development of our ascml (agent society configuration manager and launcher) tool, which is currently implemented for the jade and jadex multi-agent platforms.
@background feline exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: 16 cases (1992–2007)⋆ hypocobalaminaemia in cats has previously been identified, but the incidence reported has varied, and the frequency of folate deficiency is unknown. the aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of low cobalamin and folate levels in a population of cats that were suffering predominantly from diseases of the alimentary tract (including the liver and pancreas) and to ascertain whether severity of disease (as assessed by bodyweight and body condition score (bcs)) related to degree of deficiency. the study population comprised 103 cats, of which 16.5% had low cobalamin levels and 38.8% had low folate levels. a serendipitous finding was inorganic phosphate levels below the reference range in 48% of the cases. significant associations were found between subnormal cobalamin levels and median bcs (p=0.049); combined low folate and low cobalamin and bodyweight (p=0.002), bcs (p=0.024) and inorganic phosphate levels (p=0.003). the finding of low levels of folate and cobalamin in clinical cases suggests that supplementation may be indicated more frequently than is currently recognised.
@method protein structural model selection by combining consensus and single scoring methods for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.

@background different effects of statins on induction of diabetes mellitus: an experimental study many anecdotal reports have suggested that therapy with hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (‘statins’) can cause acute pancreatitis. we aimed to quantify the association between statins and pancreatitis and to classify the adverse effect under the dose, time, susceptibility (dots) system.we searched for controlled observational studies that assessed the risk of pancreatitis in patients receiving statins. in order to identify case reports of statin-induced pancreatitis, we looked for reports published in scientific journals and manually reviewed reports within the canadian adverse drug event monitoring system (cadrmp) database.two observational studies were identified and the data pooled together in a meta-analysis. this yielded an odds ratio of 1.41 (95% ci 1.15, 1.74) for the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a past history of exposure to statins. we also identified 20 published case reports and 33 spontaneous reports from the cadrmp database. these data showed that pancreatitis can occur at both high and low doses, with 12 cases developing pancreatitis at less than the dose equivalent of simvastatin 20mg daily. statin-induced pancreatitis can occur at any time but seems to be very uncommon early on and more likely to occur after many months of therapy. there does not appear to be a cumulative dose effect and increasing age does not appear to be a major susceptibility factor. these finding should help clinicians to better manage and diagnose patients who are at risk of statin-induced pancreatitis.

@method weblogo-2m: scalable logo detection by deep learning from the web state-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. advances like sppnet and fast r-cnn have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. in this work, we introduce a region proposal network (rpn) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. an rpn is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. the rpn is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by fast r-cnn for detection. we further merge rpn and fast r-cnn into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the rpn component tells the unified network where to look. for the very deep vgg-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a gpu, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on pascal voc 2007, 2012, and ms coco datasets with only 300 proposals per image. in ilsvrc and coco 2015 competitions, faster r-cnn and rpn are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. code has been made publicly available
@background new and old genes associated with primary and established responses to cisplatin and topotecan treatment in ovarian cancer cell lines epidermal differentiation complex (edc) comprises a number of genes associated with human skin diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and hyperkeratosis. these genes have also been linked to numerous cancers, among them skin, gastric, colorectal, lung, ovarian and renal carcinomas. the involvement of edc components encoding s100 proteins, small proline-rich proteins (sprrs) and other genes in the tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous cell cancer (hnscc) has been previously suggested. the aim of the study was to systematically analyze the expression of edc components on the transcript level in hnscc. tissue specimens from 93 patients with hnc of oral cavity and 87 samples from adjacent or distant grossly normal oral mucosawere analyzed. 48 samples (24 tumor and 24 corresponding surrounding tissue) were hybridized to affymetrix genechip human 1.0 st arrays. for validation by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) the total rna from all180 samples collected in the study was analyzed with real-time pcr system and fluorescent amplicon specific-probes. additional set of samples from 14 patients with laryngeal carcinoma previously obtained by hg-u133 plus 2.0 microarray was also included in the analyses. the expression of analyzed edc genes was heterogeneous. two transcripts (s100a1 and s100a4) were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer when compared to normal mucosa (0.69 and 0.36-fold change, respectively), showing an opposite pattern of expression to the remaining s100 genes. significant up-regulation in tumors was found for s100a11, s100a7, lce3d, s100a3 and s100a2 genes. the increased expression of s100a7 was subsequently validated by qpcr, confirming significant differences. the remaining edc genes, including all encoding sprr molecules, did not show any differences between oral cancer and normal mucosa. the observed differences were also assessed in the independent set of laryngeal cancer samples, confirming the role of s100a3 and lce3d transcripts in hnc. in hnc of oral cavity only one family of edc genes (s100 proteins) showed significant cancer-related differences. a number of other transcripts which showed altered expression in hnc require further validation.
@method advantages of joint modeling of component hiv risk behaviors and non-response: application to randomized trials in cocaine-dependent and methamphetamine-dependent populations multivariate longitudinal data with mixed continuous and discrete responses with the possibility of non-ignorable missingness are often common in follow-up medical studies and their analysis needs to be developed. standard methods of analysis based on the strong and the unverifiable assumption of missing at random (mar) mechanism could be highly misleading. a way out of this problem is to start with methods that simultaneously allow modelling non-ignorable mechanism, which includes somehow troubling computations that are often time consuming, then we can use a sensitivity analysis, in which one estimates models under a range of assumptions about non-ignorability parameters to study the impact of these parameters on key inferences. a general index of sensitivity to non-ignorability (isni) to measure sensitivity of key inferences in a neighborhood of mar model without fitting a complicated not mar (nmar) model for univariate generalized linear models and for models used for univariate longitudinal normal and non-gaussian data with potentially nmar dropout are well presented in the literature. in this paper we extend isni methodology to analyze multivariate longitudinal mixed data subject to non-ignorable dropout in which the non-ignorable dropout model could be dependent on the mixed responses. the approach is illustrated by analyzing a longitudinal data set in which the general substantive goal of the study is to better understand the relations between parental assessment of child's antisocial behavior and child's reading recognition skill.

@background trf/mir-1280 suppresses stem cell-like cells and metastasis in colorectal cancer. gata binding protein 3 (gata3) is a transcriptional activator highly expressed by the luminal epithelial cells in the breast. here we did a meta-analysis of the available breast cancer cdna data sets on a cohort of 305 patients and found that gata3 was one of the top genes with low expression in invasive carcinomas with poor clinical outcome. to validate its prognostic utility, we did a tissue microarray analysis on a cohort of 139 consecutive invasive carcinomas (n = 417 tissue samples) immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against gata3. low gata3 expression was associated with higher histologic grade (p < 0.001), positive nodes (p = 0.002), larger tumor size (p = 0.03), negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (p < 0.001 for both), and her2-neu overexpression (p = 0.03). patients whose tumors expressed low gata3 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival when compared with those whose tumors had high gata3 levels. the hazard ratio of metastasis or recurrence according to the gata3 status was 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.74; p = 0.009). cox multivariate analysis showed that gata3 had independent prognostic significance above and beyond conventional variables. our data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of gata3 may be the basis for a new clinically applicable test to predict tumor recurrence early in the progression of breast cancer.
@background development of ssr markers from musa balbisiana for genetic diversity analysis among thai bananas directly labelling locus‐specific primers for microsatellite analysis is expensive and a common limitation to small‐budget molecular ecology projects. more cost‐effective end‐labelling of pcr products can be achieved through a three primer pcr approach, involving a fluorescently labelled universal primer in combination with modified locus‐specific primers with 5′ universal primer sequence tails. this technique has been widely used but has been limited largely due to a lack of available universal primers suitable for co‐amplifying large numbers of size overlapping loci and without requiring locus‐specific pcr conditions to be modified. in this study, we report a suite of four high‐performance universal primers that can be employed in a three primer pcr approach for efficient and cost‐effective fluorescent end‐labelling of pcr fragments. amplification efficiency is maximized owing to high universal primer tm values (approximately 60+ °c) that enhance primer versatility and enable higher annealing temperatures to be employed compared with commonly used universal primers such as m13. we demonstrate that these universal primers can be combined with multiple fluorophores to co‐amplify multiple loci efficiently via multiplex pcr. this method provides a level of multiplexing and pcr efficiency similar to microsatellite fluorescent detection assays using directly labelled primers while dramatically reducing project costs. primer performance is tested using several alternative pcr strategies that involve both single and multiple fluorophores in single and multiplex pcr across a wide range of taxa.
@background comparison of beta-catenin with tgf-beta1, hif-1alpha and patients’ disease-free survival in human colorectal cancer nuclear beta-catenin and cd133 are linked with two hallmarks of colon cancer, wingless-type mouse mammary tumour virus integration site (wnt)-pathway dysregulation and colon cancer stem cells (co-cscs), respectively. both molecules may be related, as co-cscs were proposed to require activated wnt-signalling and as cd133 was postulated as a wnt/beta-catenin target gene. herein, we investigated the expression of these markers on serial sections of 162 stage iia colonic adenocarcinomas. we found that the expression of these molecules is statistically independent and that they mark distinct but overlapping subpopulations of the tumour cells. moreover, we show that their combined evaluation can identify colon cancer cases with vastly reduced survival (hazard ratio (hr) 13.4, 95% confidence interval (ci): 4.7-38.2) and a high risk of tumour progression (hr 6.8, 95%ci: 3.1-15.0). in conclusion, the independence of these markers may on the one hand have implications for their presumed value to identify co-cscs; on the other hand it allows their combined analysis to become a powerful tool to identify high risk cases of stage iia colon cancer.
@background ontogeny of postnatal hyoid and larynx descent in humans. children with craniofacial syndromes, especially those with midfacial hypoplasia, micrognathia, or deformation of the cranial base, are frequently suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas). it is important to recognize this condition. diagnostic methods and therapeutic developments are discussed. experience with 31 patients in the sophia children's hospital is presented. the majority of these infants suffered from moderate or severe osas. treatment varied from symptomatic (e.g. continuous positive airway pressure) to curative. these therapies could often prevent a tracheotomy. still more curative treatment options are needed.
@background the association between active and passive smoking and latent tuberculosis infection in adults and children in the united states: results from nhanes the influence of tobacco smoke on human health is still an important problem worldwide. complex inflammatory processes and changes in the immune system are crucial in the pathogenesis of smoking related disorders like chronic obstructive lung disease (copd), lung cancer, atherosclerosis. the objective of this review is to present the alterations in the immune system in smokers. the main affected system by cigarette smoke (cs) is the respiratory tract. in bronchial epithelium metaplastic and dysplastic changes are accompanied by elevated expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of many cytokines capable of stimulation immune cells influx. in the population of pulmonary macrophages an elevated proportion of cells, changes in expression surface markers with impaired phagocytic and antigen presenting function are observed. chronic exposure to cs causes increased production of metalloproteinases (mmp) by macrophages and proteolitic enzymes by neutrophils. these enzymes cause destruction of alveolar wall. increased apoptosis of lung tissue results in augmentation of foreign material which may play a role of autoantigen and which is a target for cytotoxic/suppressor cells. the role of regulatory t (treg) cells in this process is recently postulated. smoking cessation is the most effective method of prophylaxis and treatment of diseases related to tobacco smoking. however many immunological changes in smokers are not completely reversible after quitting smoking.
@background the opportunistic pathogen vibrio vulnificus produces outer membrane vesicles in a spatially distinct manner related to capsular polysaccharide background. vibrio cholerae excreted by cholera patients is “hyperinfectious” (hi), which can be modeled by passage through infant mice. immunization of adult female mice with v. cholerae outer-membrane vesicles (omvs) passively protects suckling mice from challenge. although v. cholerae is unable to colonize protected pups, the bacteria survive passage and have the potential to be transmitted to susceptible individuals. here, we investigated the impact of omv immunization and the hi state on v. cholerae transmission. methods. neonatal mice suckled by omv- or sham-immunized dams were challenged with hi v. cholerae. the infectivity of spatially and temporally separate v. cholerae populations obtained from infected naive or protected pups was tested. recombination-based in vivo expression technology was used to assess virulence gene expression within these populations. results. omv immunization significantly reduced colonization of neonates challenged with hi v. cholerae. vibrio cholerae that had colonized the naive host was hi, whereas v. cholerae excreted by neonates born to omv-immunized dams, although viable, was hypoinfectious and failed to fully induce virulence gene expression. conclusions. omv immunization can significantly reduce the v. cholerae burden upon challenge with hi v. cholerae and can also block transmission from immune mice by reducing the infectivity of shed bacteria.
@background dietary patterns throughout adult life are associated with body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, and red cell folate. this book provides a practical introduction to some important aspects of longitudinal data analysis for both observational and experimental studies. the definition of longitudinal data used, is where the same outcomes are measured at several different time points. the consequence of using this definition is that techniques using a single terminal event, such as death or onset of a chronic disease as their outcome, including survival analysis, are outside the scope of this book. this is not really a limitation, as it allows the book to focus on concepts and methods that are all too often overlooked by epidemiologists and other researchers conducting longitudinal research. increasingly, standard statistical software packages provide the resources to conduct truly longitudinal analyses as described in this book, so more epidemiologists should be using these techniques to get more from their longitudinal material. this book will appeal especially to those who would like to use more appropriate statistics for longitudinal analysis without having to work through their entire mathematical derivation. of course, no book on statistics would be complete without a few equations, but they are sparingly used and shouldn’t deter the mathematically challenged. an attractive feature is that examples are illustrated using output from the relevant software packages to aid interpretation of results and there is a section on software covering procedures in stata, sas, spss, s-plus and mlwin. after an introduction to some basic concepts in longitudinal research, the book goes on to discuss techniques for investigating the associations of predictive measures with outcomes at repeated time points. there are separate sections for continuous and dichotomous outcomes; beginning with simpler approaches and moving on to more sophisticated techniques. there is also some coverage of the potentially more complicated analyses using ordered categorical outcomes, that can be modelled using methods equivalent to polytomous or multinomial logistic regression. while some more basic and familiar methods are coved, the most comprehensively discussed techniques are generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis, which effectively provide equivalents of both linear and logistic regression for longitudinal data. why does longitudinal data analysis require methods such as generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis rather than other, more familiar, techniques? because the more basic techniques cannot capture and quantify the complex development of relationships between predictor and outcome variables over time, central to studies of many biological phenomena such as growth and age-dependent variation in blood pressure. this book offers practical advice on measuring associations that may change over time, where time is considered continuously or categorically and there is also coverage of time-lag effects. such a longitudinal approach allows investigation of variation both within subjects and between groups over time. quantification of the stability of associations over time can be undertaken and this can form part of an assessment for longitudinal development of disease risks. a problem that often plagues longitudinal research is that of missing values. of course this is a problem for cross sectional studies too, but repeated measures often compound difficulties associated with missing data. the book discusses methods to assess if patterns of missing data are independent of predictor or outcome variables and suggest some strategies to minimise their impact on the results, including imputation techniques. at present, many epidemiological researchers do not exploit fully their longitudinal data. this is because they employ cross-sectional techniques or methods that only poorly measure changing associations over time. most of this book is written in a style that will be understood by non-statisticians and it could encourage fuller use of longitudinal data by epidemiologists.
@background advances in diagnosis, surveillance, and monitoring of zika virus: an update rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious agents is essential for patient care, disease control, and countermeasure development. the present serologic diagnosis of zika virus (zikv) infection relies mainly on igm-capture elisa which is confounded with the flaw of cross-reactivity among different flaviviruses. in this communication, we report a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (mia) that captures the diagnostic power of viral envelope protein (that elicits robust, yet cross-reactive antibodies to other flaviviruses) and the differential power of viral nonstructural proteins ns1 and ns5 (that induce more virus-type specific antibodies). using 153 patient specimens with known zikv and/or dengue virus (denv; a closely related flavivirus) infections, we showed that (i) zikv envelope-based mia is equivalent or more sensitive than igm-capture elisa in diagnosing zikv infection, (ii) antibody responses to ns1 and ns5 proteins are more zikv-specific than antibody response to envelope protein, (iii) inclusion of ns1 and ns5 in the mia improves the diagnostic accuracy when compared with the mia that uses envelope protein alone. the multiplex mia achieves a rapid diagnosis (turnaround time < 4 h) and requires small specimen volume (10 μl) in a single reaction. this serologic assay could be developed for use in clinical diagnosis of zikv infection and for monitoring immune responses in vaccine trials.
@method prevention of arterial stiffening by using low-dose atorvastatin in diabetes is associated with decreased malondialdehyde human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat) transacylates the sn-2 fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol forming cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. measurement of the phospholipase a2 and transacylase activities of the enzyme using proteoliposome substrates and following selective chemical modification of serine, histidine, and cysteine residues of pure homogeneous lcat indicated the following catalytic mechanism: hs-cys-e-ser-oh + lecithin in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa + lysolecithin, hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa in equilibrium fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh, fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-oh in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-o-fa, where fa denotes fatty acid. modification of 2 lcat cysteine residues with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or treatment with ferricyanide inactivated the transacylase but not the phospholipase a2 activity. modification of 1 serine residue with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or 1 histidine residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate inhibited cholesteryl ester formation and phospholipase a2 activity. proteoliposome substrates protected both activities against chemical inactivation. lecithin alone protected the phospholipase a2 activity against phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride inactivation but not the transacylase against 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inactivation. incubation of native lcat with arachidonyl-coa or the lecithin-apo-a-i proteoliposome resulted in acylation of three enzyme sites, only one of which was stable to neutral hydroxylamine after denaturation. fatty acylenzyme oxy- and thioesters were demonstrable in both cases. no transfer of arachidonic acid from iodoacetamide-modified lcat to cholesterol occurred, indicating that the fatty-acylated serine residue cannot directly esterify cholesterol. cholesterol arachidonate was formed upon incubation of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-modified lcat with arachidonyl-coa.
@method pollination, wounding and jasmonate treatments induce the expression of a developmentally regulated pistil dioxygenase at a distance, in the ovary, in the wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
@background effect of handling on neurotransmitter profile in pig brain according to fear related behaviour the serotonin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis play important roles in modulating fear and stress-coping characteristics. tonic immobility (ti) is a fear-related phenotype, and previously we have shown that broiler chickens showing short ti (sti) duration experience better growth performance and higher adaptability to stress. here, we sought to further elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the phenotypic differences between chickens showing sti and long ti duration, by comparing the hypothalamic expression of genes in the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under basal and corticosterone-exposed situations. the sti broilers had significantly lower (p < 0.01) hypothalamic expression of serotonin reuptake transporter and serotonin receptor 1a. moreover, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 was expressed significantly lower in sti chickens at the level of both mrna (p < 0.01) and protein (p < 0.05). hypothalamic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) mrna tended to be higher (p < 0.059) in long ti chickens, but the protein content was approximately 2 times higher (p < 0.01) in sti chickens. the uncoupled expression of gr mrna and protein was associated with significantly lower (p < 0.05) expression of gga-mir-181a, gga-mir-211, and gga-mir-22, which are predicted to target gr, in sti chickens. corticosterone administration reduced the mrna expression of postsynaptic serotonin receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1b (p = 0.059) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (p < 0.05), yet significantly increased the protein content of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (p < 0.05). these results suggest that broilers of different ti phenotypes have a distinct pattern of hypothalamic expression of fear- and stress-related genes.
@background evaluation of lateral spinal hemisection as a preclinical model of spinal cord injury pain the mechanisms underlying central pain following spinal cord injury (sci) are unsettled. the purpose of the present study was to examine differences in spinothalamic tract function below injury level and evoked pain in incomplete sci patients with neuropathic pain below injury level (central pain) versus those without such pain. a clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were performed in 10 sci patients with below-level pain and in 11 sci patients without neuropathic pain. patients with and without pain had similar reductions of mechanical and thermal detection thresholds below injury level. sci patients with central pain had sensory hypersensitivity in dermatomes corresponding to the lesion level more frequently than sci patients without pain, but this may in part be explained by the exclusion of at-level spontaneous pain in the pain-free group. the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion measured by mri did not differ between the two patient groups, and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the predefined areas of interest on the axial plane images. this study suggests that neuronal hyperexcitability plays a key role in central sci pain and furthermore - in contrast to previous findings - that loss of spinothalamic functions does not appear to be a predictor for central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury.
@method wheelchair propulsion biomechanics in junior basketball players: a method for the evaluation of the efficacy of a specific training program magnetic and inertial measurement units are an emerging technology to obtain 3d orientation of body segments in human movement analysis. in this respect, sensor fusion is used to limit the drift errors resulting from the gyroscope data integration by exploiting accelerometer and magnetic aiding sensors. the present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of sensor fusion methods under different experimental conditions. manual and locomotion tasks, differing in time duration, measurement volume, presence/absence of static phases, and out-of-plane movements, were performed by six subjects, and recorded by one unit located on the forearm or the lower trunk, respectively. two sensor fusion methods, representative of the stochastic (extended kalman filter) and complementary (non-linear observer) filtering, were selected, and their accuracy was assessed in terms of attitude (pitch and roll angles) and heading (yaw angle) errors using stereophotogrammetric data as a reference. the sensor fusion approaches provided significantly more accurate results than gyroscope data integration. accuracy improved mostly for heading and when the movement exhibited stationary phases, evenly distributed 3d rotations, it occurred in a small volume, and its duration was greater than approximately 20 s. these results were independent from the specific sensor fusion method used. practice guidelines for improving the outcome accuracy are provided.
@result evaluation of the association of pik3ca mutations and pten loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer background in an attempt to identify markers of resistance to trastuzumab, we evaluated both the profiling of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-positive tumor cells measuring the relative levels of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten and their correlations with clinical outcome in her2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab.   patients and methods tumor tissues for this retrospective analysis were available from 45 out of 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated from april 1999 to march 2006 with trastuzumab-based therapy at our institution. evaluations of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by immunohistochemistry (ihc) were carried out on all 45 tissue samples and their correlations with response to trastuzumab, incidence of central nervous system (cns) metastases, time to progression (ttp), overall survival from diagnosis of breast cancer (os1), from diagnosis of metastatic disease (os2) and from the start of trastuzumab (os3) were analyzed.   results we observed that ttp (p = 0.001) and median os2 and os3 were significantly longer in patients responsive to trastuzumab-based regimen compared with nonresponsive patients. egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by ihc were not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, overall survival (os1, os2, os3) and cns metastases incidence. a trend for shorter os3 was observed for pmapk-positive patients compared with pmapk-negative patients (22.8 versus 31.2 months; p = 0.076). median os1 resulted shorter in 22 pakt-positive patients (69.8 months) compared with 23 pakt-negative patients (108.2 months); p = 0.091. it is likely that high expression of pmapk (pmapk-positive status) or pakt (pakt-positive status) could identify a subgroup of her2-positive tumors with high activity of proliferation and survival pathways and with resistance to trastuzumab.   conclusions in her2-positive metastatic breast cancers, egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status evaluated by ihc was not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, os and cns metastases incidence. however, her2 status determined by ihc and/or fish assays may not be sufficient to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapy.
@background diet and vitamin or mineral supplements and risk of renal cell carcinoma in canada the role of diet in the aetiology of renal cell carcinoma was investigated in a population-based case-control study in denmark. cases were 20-79 years old, with a histologically verified diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. controls were sampled from the general population and were frequency-matched on age and sex. a total of 351 cases (73% of the eligible) and 340 controls (68% of the eligible) were included in the study. dietary information was obtained in a self-administered food frequency questionnaire and the information was confirmed in a subsequent interview performed by trained interviewers who also elicited information on other suspected risk factors such as smoking, occupation, medical history, education and reproductive history. logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios, and, both frequency of consumption of various food stuffs and computed nutrients were examined. a positive association was observed between risk of renal cell carcinoma and total energy intake (odds ratio, or, for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.7 (95% confidence interval, ci, 1.0-3.0) for men, and 3.5 (95% ci 1.6-6.5) for women), fat intake (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.9 (95% ci 1.1-3.5) for men, and 3.3 (95% ci 1.6-6.9) for women). for women, an effect was also seen for intake of carbohydrates (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 3.2 (95% ci 1.5-6.8), while no protective effect was seen for vegetables or fruit. dairy products may be associated with risk of renal cell cancer (or for women using thickly spread butter compared to thinly spread: 11.4 (95% ci 2.8-45), or for women who drank more than one glass of milk with 3.5% fat content compared to never drink milk: 3.7 (95% ci 1.2-11). as expected, total energy intake, intake of fat, protein and carbohydrates were closely correlated making it difficult to identify one of the energy sources as more closely associated with risk of renal cell cancer than the other. several energy sources have been identified as possible risk factors for renal cell carcinoma. it is possible that a high energy intake as such rather than the individual sources are responsible for the increased risk. furthermore, dairy fats may be associated with renal cell carcinoma risk. the observed associations appeared stronger in women, and did not explain the association with obesity and low socio-economic status previously found in denmark.
@method family history of suicide and personality two orthogonal personality traits or predispositions, impulsiveness and anxiety, have been invariant in five separate factor analyses. one of these analyses is presented here along with an item analysis of the barratt impulsiveness scale (bis) which has a high loading on the impulsiveness factor. the bis has never significantly correlated with any of the various anxiety or emotional stability measures in over 50 administrations of the scale, further evidence for the invariance of these two second-order factors.
@method genitourinary health of sexually abused girls and boys: a matched‐cohort study purpose to estimate the likelihood that a recent cohort of children would be exposed to sexual abuse and sexual assault by age 17 in the united states.   methods this analysis draws on three very similarly designed national telephone surveys of youth in 2003, 2008, and 2011, resulting in a pooled sample of 708 17-year-olds, 781 15-year-olds, and 804 16-year-olds.   results the lifetime experience of 17-year-olds with sexual abuse and sexual assault was 26.6% (95% confidence interval [ci] 19.8-33.5) for girls and 5.1% (95% ci 2.6-7.6) for boys. the lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of adult perpetrators exclusively was 11.2% (95% ci 6.4-16.1) for females and 1.9% (95% ci .5-3.4) for males. for females, considerable risk for sexual abuse and assault was concentrated in late adolescence, as the rate rose from 16.8% (95% ci 11.5-22.2) for 15-year-old females to 26.6% (95% ci 19.8-33.5) for 17-year-old females. for males, it rose from 4.3% (95% ci 1.9-6.8) at 15 years to 5.1% (2.6-7.6) at 17 years.   conclusions self-report surveys in late adolescence reveal high rates of lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of both adults and peers. because of high continuing victimization during the late teen years, assessments are most complete when conducted among the oldest youth.
@method discrimination and perception of the acoustic rendition of texts by blind people in this paper we present the design and development of a modular and scalable speech composer named demosthenes. it has been designed for converting plain or formatted text (e.g. hmtl) to a combination of speech and audio signals. demosthenes' architecture constitutes an extension to current text-to-speech systems’ structure that enables an open set of module-defined functions to interact with the under processing text at any stage of the text-tospeech conversion. details on its implementation are given here. furthermore, we present some techniques for text handling and prosody generation using demosthenes.
@background involvement of eralpha and erbeta in estradiol-induced enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis and sexual behaviour two hours following intraperitoneal injection, estradiol‐h3 is concentrated by cells in a system of limbic and hypothalamic structures. preoptic‐hypothalamic nuclei containing estrogen‐concentrating cells include the medial preoptic area, medial anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus and ventral premammillary nucleus. limbic structures include the medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of broca, olfactory tubercle, ventral hippocampus, and prepiriform and entorhinal cortex. labelled cells were also found in the lateral and ventrolateral portions of the mesencephalic central grey. compared to these regions, most other regions of the nervous system, including the spinal cord, have very small numbers of labelled cells, which are relatively weakly labelled, and are not found in regular, specific locations. the distribution of estrogen‐concentrating cells determined with the present autoradiographic method agrees with previous autoradiographic conclusions and with biochemical results from cell fractionation experiments.
@background visualizing the endocytic and exocytic processes of wheat germ agglutinin by quantum dot-based single-particle tracking. the delivery of therapeutic agents to, or via, the oral cavity is limited by the efficient removal mechanisms that exist in this area. lectins are proteins or glycoproteins that bind to specific sugar residues, and can, therefore, interact with the glycoconjugates present on cell surfaces or salivary mucins. endogenous lectins could also be used as points of attachment for carbohydrate-containing delivery systems. this review considers the possibility of using lectins as targeting agents within the oral cavity and reports on some of the limited number of studies completed to date. as lectins are multifunctional molecules, the possibility of using them as both targeting and therapeutic agents is considered. lectin-containing delivery systems are a potential innovation for targeted and prolonged therapy within the oral cavity, but considerations such as toxicity and cost will need to be addressed before their routine use becomes a reality.
@method remodelling of human atrial k+ currents but not ion channel expression by chronic β-blockade objective to investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation (af), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.   methods the whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record action potentials, the effective refractory period (erp) and ion currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6 months) af and 39 patients in sinus rhythm.   results stimulation at high rates (up to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the erp in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum diastolic potential (mdp). chronic af was associated with a reduction in the erp at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, p<0.05), and marked attenuation in rate effects on the erp and repolarisation. the abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced depolarisation of the mdp in cells from patients with af. the density of l-type ca(2+) (i(cal)) and transient outward k(+) (i(to)) currents was significantly reduced in cells from patients with af (by 60-65%), whilst the inward rectifier k(+) current (i(k1)) was increased, and the sustained outward current (i(ksus)) was unaltered. superfusion of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l) moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the erp (228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged repolarisation and the erp (by 35%, p<0.05). however, the combination of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.   conclusion chronic af in humans is associated with attenuation in adaptation of the atrial single cell erp and mdp to fast rates, which may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in i(cal) and i(to).
@result chianina beef tenderness investigated through integrated omics. within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
@result the complexity of conservative valued csps in the constraint satisfaction problem ($csp$), the aim is to find an assignment of values to a set of variables subject to specified constraints. in the minimum cost homomorphism problem ($minhom$), one is additionally given weights $c_{va}$ for every variable $v$ and value $a$, and the aim is to find an assignment $f$ to the variables that minimizes $\sum_{v} c_{vf(v)}$. let $minhom(\gamma)$ denote the $minhom$ problem parameterized by the set of predicates allowed for constraints. $minhom(\gamma)$ is related to many well-studied combinatorial optimization problems, and concrete applications can be found in, for instance, defence logistics and machine learning. we show that $minhom(\gamma)$ can be studied by using algebraic methods similar to those used for csps. with the aid of algebraic techniques, we classify the computational complexity of $minhom(\gamma)$ for all choices of $\gamma$. our result settles a general dichotomy conjecture previously resolved only for certain classes of directed graphs, [gutin, hell, rafiey, yeo, european j. of combinatorics, 2008].
@background an application of a decision tree for assessing effects from exposures to multiple substances to the assessment of human and ecological effects from combined exposures to chemicals observed in surface waters and waste water effluents the threshold of toxicological concern (ttc) is a pragmatic risk assessment tool that is based on the principle of establishing a human exposure threshold value for all chemicals, below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. the concept that there are levels of exposure that do not cause adverse effects is inherent in setting acceptable daily intakes (adis) for chemicals with known toxicological profiles. the ttc principle extends this concept by proposing that a de minimis value can be identified for many chemicals, in the absence of a full toxicity database, based on their chemical structures and the known toxicity of chemicals which share similar structural characteristics. the establishment and application of widely accepted ttc values would benefit consumers, industry and regulators. by avoiding unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intakes are below such a threshold, application of the ttc approach would focus limited resources of time, cost, animal use and expertise on the testing and evaluation of substances with the greatest potential to pose risks to human health and thereby contribute to a reduction in the use of animals. an expert group of the european branch of the international life sciences institute-ilsi europe-has examined the ttc principle for its wider applicability in food safety evaluation. the expert group examined metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific endpoints, such as neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity and immunotoxicity, and determined whether such properties or endpoints had to be taken into consideration specifically in a step-wise approach. the expert group concluded that the ttc principle can be applied for low concentrations in food of chemicals that lack toxicity data, provided that there is a sound intake estimate. the use of a decision tree to apply the ttc principle is proposed, and this paper describes the step-wise process in detail. proteins, heavy metals and polyhalogenated-dibenzodioxins and related compounds were excluded from this approach. when assessing a chemical, a review of prior knowledge and context of use should always precede the use of the ttc decision tree. the initial step is the identification and evaluation of possible genotoxic and/or high potency carcinogens. following this step, non-genotoxic substances are evaluated in a sequence of steps related to the concerns that would be associated with increasing intakes. for organophosphates a ttc of 18microg per person per day (0.3 microg/kg bw/day) is proposed, and when the compound is not an op, the ttc values for the cramer structural classes iii, ii and i, with their respective ttc levels (e.g. 1800, 540 and 90 microg per person per day; or 30, 9 and 1.5 microg/kg bw /day), would be applied sequentially. all other endpoints or properties were shown to have a distribution of no observed effect levels (noels) similar to the distribution of noels for general toxicity endpoints in cramer classes i, ii and iii. the document was discussed with a wider audience during a workshop held in march 2003 (see list of workshop participants).
@result deciding the fate of supernumerary frozen embryos: parents' choices human embryos can only be stored in the first instance for 3 years in western australia, according to the west australian reproductive technology act. thereafter, an application must be made to the local regulatory body, the reproductive technology council, for an extension. of the 650 batches of embryos frozen between 8 april 1993 and 31 october 1995, 170 (26.2%) batches were still in storage after 2.5 years. a reminding letter was sent at this time to the couples to whom the embryos belonged, i.e. 6 months before the expiry of the initial storage period, asking for clarification of what was to be done with the embryos. a large proportion of patients (64.7%) chose to either extend the storage period or thaw and transfer the embryos. curiously, more batches of embryos were discarded (18.8%) than donated to other couples (5.9%). contact with the patients was lost in a small but significant proportion of cases; more of these had been unsuccessful in their treatment (20.4%) than had achieved a pregnancy (4.3%).
@result modeling of the wrinkling of premixed turbulent flames in the thin reaction zones regime for large eddy simulation by abstract a consistent formulation of the g -equation approach for les is developed. the unfiltered g equation is valid only at the instantaneous flame front location. hence, in a filtering procedure applied to derive the appropriate les equation, only the instantaneous unfiltered flame surface can be considered. a new filter kernel is provided, which averages along the flame surface. the filter kernel is used to derive the g equation for the filtered flame front location. this equation has two unclosed terms, involving a flame front conditional averaged flow velocity, and a filtered propagation term. a model for the conditional velocity is derived, expressing this quantity in terms of the favre-filtered flow velocity, which is typically known from a flow solver. this model leads to the appearance of a density ratio in the propagation term of the g equation. les of combustion in the thin reaction zones regime is discussed in the les regime diagram. a new line is identified separating the thin reaction zones regime into two parts, where the broadened flame thickness is larger and smaller than the filter size, respectively. a model for the propagation term is provided. this leads to a term including the subfilter turbulent burning velocity and an additional term proportional to the resolved flame front curvature. for the former, an algebraic model is provided from an equation for the subfilter flame front wrinkling. the latter term depends on the inverse of the subfilter damkohler number and disappears in the corrugated flamelets regime.

@method effect of single-dose dexmedetomidine on postoperative recovery after ambulatory ureteroscopy and ureteric stenting: a double blind randomized controlled study alphaxalone-alphadolone (althesin), diluted and administered as a controlled infusion, was used as a sedative for 30 patients in an intensive therapy unit. this technique allowed rapid and accurate control of the level of sedation. it had three particularly useful applications: it provided “light sleep,” allowed rapid variation in the level of sedation, and enabled repeated assessment of the central nervous system. sedation was satisfactory for 86% of the total time, and no serious complications were attributed to the use of the drug. furthermore, though alphaxalone-alphadolone was given for periods up to 20 days there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis or delay in recovery time.
@result morphological changes of paulownia seedlings infected phytoplasmas reveal the genes associated with witches' broom through aflp and msap recent research has demonstrated that dna methylation plays an integral role in regulating the timing of flowering and in endosperm development. the identification of key genes controlling these processes, the expression of which is altered in plants with low methylation, opens the way to understanding how dna methylation regulates plant development.
@method process evaluation results from the healthy physical education intervention. the healthy primary prevention trial was designed and implemented in response to the growing numbers of children and adolescents being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. the objective was to moderate risk factors for type 2 diabetes. modifiable risk factors measured were indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation: body mass index ⩾85th percentile, fasting glucose ⩾5.55 mmol l−1 (100 mg per 100 ml) and fasting insulin ⩾180 pmol l−1 (30 μu ml−1). a series of pilot studies established the feasibility of performing data collection procedures and tested the development of an intervention consisting of four integrated components: (1) changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage offerings throughout the total school food environment; (2) physical education class lesson plans and accompanying equipment to increase both participation and number of minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; (3) brief classroom activities and family outreach vehicles to increase knowledge, enhance decision-making skills and support and reinforce youth in accomplishing goals; and (4) communications and social marketing strategies to enhance and promote changes through messages, images, events and activities. expert study staff provided training, assistance, materials and guidance for school faculty and staff to implement the intervention components. a cohort of students were enrolled in sixth grade and followed to end of eighth grade. they attended a health screening data collection at baseline and end of study that involved measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and a fasting blood draw. height and weight were also collected at the end of the seventh grade. the study was conducted in 42 middle schools, six at each of seven locations across the country, with 21 schools randomized to receive the intervention and 21 to act as controls (data collection activities only). middle school was the unit of sample size and power computation, randomization, intervention and primary analysis.
@background micrornas enriched in hematopoietic stem cells differentially regulate long-term hematopoietic output to improve our ability to identify hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and their localization in vivo, we compared the gene expression profiles of highly purified hscs and non-self-renewing multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (mpps). cell surface receptors of the slam family, including cd150, cd244, and cd48, were differentially expressed among functionally distinct progenitors. hscs were highly purified as cd150(+)cd244(-)cd48(-) cells while mpps were cd244(+)cd150(-)cd48(-) and most restricted progenitors were cd48(+)cd244(+)cd150(-). the primitiveness of hematopoietic progenitors could thus be predicted based on the combination of slam family members they expressed. this is the first family of receptors whose combinatorial expression precisely distinguishes stem and progenitor cells. the ability to purify hscs based on a simple combination of slam receptors allowed us to identify hscs in tissue sections. many hscs were associated with sinusoidal endothelium in spleen and bone marrow, though some hscs were associated with endosteum. hscs thus occupy multiple niches, including sinusoidal endothelium in diverse tissues.
@method α-hydroxybutyrate is an early biomarker of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in a nondiabetic population to address the challenges associated with metabolomics analyses, such as identification of chemical structures and elimination of experimental artifacts, we developed a platform that integrated the chemical analysis, including identification and relative quantification, data reduction, and quality assurance components of the process. the analytical platform incorporated two separate ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (uhplc/ms/ms(2)) injections; one injection was optimized for basic species, and the other was optimized for acidic species. this approach permitted the detection of 339 small molecules, a total instrument analysis time of 24 min (two injections at 12 min each), while maintaining a median process variability of 9%. the resulting ms/ms(2) data were searched against an in-house generated authentic standard library that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as their associated ms/ms spectra for all molecules in the library. the library allowed the rapid and high-confidence identification of the experimentally detected molecules based on a multiparameter match without need for additional analyses. this integrated platform enabled the high-throughput collection and relative quantitative analysis of analytical data and identified a large number and broad spectrum of molecules with a high degree of confidence.
@background adversity of prolonged extreme cold exposure among adult clients diagnosed with coronary artery diseases: a primer for recommending community health nursing intervention the potential health impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, from direct impacts at familiar local scales, through indirect effects occurring at the regional or ecosystem level, to long term effects on the sustainability of global systems. to assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. we discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. at the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. from an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.
@result dental functional status with and without tooth replacement in a chinese adult population purpose to review the influence of prosthodontic and dental implant treatment on patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life (ohqol) based on a systematic search of the literature.   materials and methods a systematic literature search was carried out for articles published between 1960 and february 2003. details of the search process and results were reported in part 1 of the study (int j prosthodont2004;17:83-93). the included studies were categorized and evaluated according to their level of evidence, following the guidelines of the agency for health care policy and research. the characteristics and content of the studies were analyzed and tabulated.   results among the 114 included studies, there were 76 publications reaching evidence level iii. the results showed that the effects of compromised oral health are not limited to traditional clinical aspects, but can considerably affect patients in various activities of daily life. twenty-four of the 38 investigations with evidence levels i and ii dealt with implant stabilization of complete mandibular prostheses, comparing implant prostheses to conventional complete dentures. fully edentulous patients experience negative impacts on ohqol from their condition. they benefit significantly from the use of dental implants to support mandibular prostheses. however, support by more than 2 implants does not appear to further significantly increase patient satisfaction and ohqol.   conclusions to date, research in the field of patient-based outcomes has concentrated on dental implant treatment for the edentulous patient. other prosthetic treatments such as single crowns, fixed and removable partial dentures, or further treatment concepts (eg, the shortened dental arch concept) are not well represented. the use of patient-centered outcome measures can help to find an individual, patient-oriented prosthetic solution.
@background evaluation of the reproductive toxicity of fungicide propiconazole in male rats. many pesticides are able to block or activate the steroid hormone receptors and/or to affect the levels of sex hormones, thereby potentially affecting the development or expression of the male and female reproductive system or both. this emphasizes the relevance of screening pesticides for a wide range of hormone-mimicking effects. twenty-two pesticides were tested for their ability to affect cyp19 aromatase activity in human placental microsomes using the classical [(3)h](2)o method. prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole, fenarimol, triadimenol, triadimefon (all fungicides), and dicofol (an acaricide) gave rise to a statistically significant inhibition of aromatase activity. the ic(50)s of prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole fenarimol, triadimenol, and triadimefon were calculated from dose-response curves to be 0.04, 0.34, 6.5, 10, 21 and 32 microm, respectively. the ic(50) of dicofol was greater than 50 microm. the positive control 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) caused an inhibition of aromatase activity by 74%. the compounds, which did not affect the aromatase activity, were bromopropylate, chlorfenvinphos, chlorobenzilate, chlorpyrifos, diuron, heptachlor, iprodion, linuron, pentachlorphenol, procymidon, propyzamide, quintozen, tetrachlorvinphos and tetradifon. with the purpose of comparing the results for fenarimol obtained with the microsomal system with data from an intact cell system, an aromatase assay based on jeg-3 cells was established. 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) inhibited the aromatase activity in jeg-3 cells by 94%. the ic(50) for fenarimol in this system was 2 microm, slightly lower than that observed in the microsomal system. for the first time, fenarimol has been demonstrated to inhibit aromatase activity in human tissues and, furthermore, propioconazole, triadimefon, and triadimenol were identified as weak aromatase inhibitors. in conclusion, seven out of 22 tested pesticides turned out to be weak to moderate aromatase inhibitors in vitro, indicating the relevance of elucidating the endocrine effects in vivo of these- compounds.
@background variance in prominence levels and in patterns of passing sequences in elite and youth soccer players: a network approach abstract the aim of this study was to propose a set of network methods to measure the specific properties of a team. these metrics were organised at macro-analysis levels. the interactions between teammates were collected and then processed following the analysis levels herein announced. overall, 577 offensive plays were analysed from five matches. the network density showed an ambiguous relationship among the team, mainly during the 2nd half. the mean values of density for all matches were 0.48 in the 1st half, 0.32 in the 2nd half and 0.34 for the whole match. the heterogeneity coefficient for the overall matches rounded to 0.47 and it was also observed that this increased in all matches in the 2nd half. the centralisation values showed that there was no ‘star topology’. the results suggest that each node (i.e., each player) had nearly the same connectivity, mainly in the 1st half. nevertheless, the values increased in the 2nd half, showing a decreasing participation of all players at the same level. briefly, these metrics showed that it is possible to identify how players connect with each other and the kind and strength of the connections between them. in summary, it may be concluded that network metrics can be a powerful tool to help coaches understand team’s specific properties and support decision-making to improve the sports training process based on match analysis.
@result arrested demixing opens route to bigels we numerically investigate the competition between phase separation and dynamical arrest in a colloidal system interacting via a short-ranged attractive potential. equilibrium fluid configurations are quenched at two different temperatures below the critical temperature and followed during their time evolution. at the lowest studied t, the phase-separation process is interrupted by the formation of an attractive glass in the dense phase. at the higher t, no arrest is observed and the phase-separation process proceeds endlessly in the simulated time window. the final structure of the glass retains memory of the interrupted phase-separation process in the form of a frozen spinodal decomposition peak, whose location and amplitude is controlled by the average packing fraction. we also discuss the time evolution of the nonergodicity parameter, providing evidence of a progressively decreasing localization length on increasing the packing fraction. finally, we confirm that the reported results are independent of the microscopic dynamics.
@method hsp72 inhibits apoptosis-inducing factor release in atp-depleted renal epithelial cells. the events that precipitate cell death and the stress proteins responsible for cytoprotection during atp depletion remain elusive. we hypothesize that exposure to metabolic inhibitors damages mitochondria, allowing proapoptotic proteins to leak into the cytosol, and suggest that heat stress-induced hsp72 accumulation prevents mitochondrial membrane injury. to test these hypotheses, renal epithelial cells were transiently atp depleted with sodium cyanide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose in the absence of medium dextrose. recovery from atp depletion was associated with the release into the cytosol of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), proapoptotic proteins that localize to the intermitochondrial membrane space. concomitant with mitochondrial cytochrome c leak, a seven- to eightfold increase in caspase 3 activity was observed. in controls, state iii mitochondrial respiration was reduced by 30% after transient exposure to metabolic inhibitors. prior heat stress preserved mitochondrial atp production and significantly reduced both cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. despite less cytochrome c release, prior heat stress increased binding between cytochrome c and hsp72. the present study demonstrates that mitochondrial injury accompanies exposure to metabolic inhibitors. by reducing outer mitochondrial membrane injury and by complexing with cytochrome c, hsp72 could inhibit caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis.
@result family needs in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury from colombia, south america the responses to a questionnaire on subjective burden are reported for 52 primary caregivers of a group of persons with traumatic brain injuries sustained an average of 6 years previously. the aim of the study was to examine satisfaction with social support, perception of coping skills, and appraisal of symptoms as predictors of strain in the carers. a range of responses, both positive and negative, to the work of caring for a relative with a head injury was reported. a high prevalence rate of emotional and behavioural changes in the persons with head injuries was found and the amount of distress caused by these symptoms was found to be predictive of burden. the other factor important in predicting burden was the carers ratings of their satisfaction with their ability to cope with the work of caregiv ing. social support, injury severity, and the demographic characteristics of the persons with head injury and their carers were not significant predictors. depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of elevated depression scores was coping satisfaction. these findings reinforce the importance of strengthening carers coping resources in rehabilitation work with head injured persons and their families.
@result interactive effects of selenium and mercury on the restoration potential of leaves of the medicinal plant, portulaca oleracea linn. abstract effects of sodium selenate and selenite on the toxic effect of methylmercuric chloride (mmc) on nervous tissue in culture were studied. sliced newborn rat cerebella were cultured in a medium containing mmc and selenate or selenite. the concentrations of sodium selenate and selenite that showed remarkable protective effect against the neurotoxicity of mmc were 0.8 and 0.2 × 10 −5 m , respectively. the protective effect of sodium selenite was additive with that of dl -α-tocopherol acetate (vitamin e). however, 4 × 10 −5 m sodium selenate and 1 × 10 −5 m sodium selenite per se showed an obvious toxic effect on the outgrowth of nerve fibers and cells from cerebellum tissue in culture. the toxicity of selenium was additive to that of mmc. these results indicate that oxidized selenium at low concentrations is able to modify the neurotoxicity of mmc and that different states of selenium produce different degrees of protection. they suggest further that the adverse effect of selenium is additive to the toxicity of alkyl mercurial at the toxic level of selenium.
@result key beliefs for targeted interventions to increase physical activity in children: analyzing data from an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour we examined predictors of leisure-time physical activity intention and behaviour in children, and the potential direct and moderating effects of gender and ethnicity. participants were 364 (230 asian; 134 caucasian) 9-11-year-old children who completed measures of the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) and physical activity behaviour (physical activity questionnaire for children) across three, 3-month intervals (i.e., two prediction time-periods) in canada. the tpb explained 35-50% of the variance in physical activity behaviour and 74-76% of the variance in intention using structural equation modelling. an autoregressive longitudinal path model showed that the tpb predicted changes in physical activity and physical activity predicted changes in tpb constructs (p<.05). overall, intention and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) contributors to the direct prediction of behaviour and subjective norm and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) predictors of intention. gender did not show a robust relationship with physical activity or intention, but the effect of ethnicity on physical activity was mediated through perceived behavioural control (asians less active than caucasians). finally, gender and ethnicity did not moderate tpb and physical activity relations (p<.05). these data suggest that childhood may be a formative stage for the development of physical activity cognitions and that promoting physical activity in children may require normative and control-based intervention.
@method regulatory expression of genes related to metastasis by tgf-β and activin a in b16 murine melanoma cells smad transcription factors lie at the core of one of the most versatile cytokine signaling pathways in metazoan biology-the transforming growth factor-beta (tgfbeta) pathway. recent progress has shed light into the processes of smad activation and deactivation, nucleocytoplasmic dynamics, and assembly of transcriptional complexes. a rich repertoire of regulatory devices exerts control over each step of the smad pathway. this knowledge is enabling work on more complex questions about the organization, integration, and modulation of smad-dependent transcriptional programs. we are beginning to uncover self-enabled gene response cascades, graded smad response mechanisms, and smad-dependent synexpression groups. our growing understanding of tgfbeta signaling through the smad pathway provides general principles for how animal cells translate complex inputs into concrete behavior.
@background stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in rats is selectively suppressed by the neurokinin 1 (nk1) antagonist l822429 recent data indicate that alcohol dependence induces long-term neuroadaptations that recruit a negative emotional state. this leads to excessive alcohol ingestion motivated by relief of negative emotionality. a key mechanism in this transition to negative reinforcement is a recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) signaling within the amygdala. long term upregulation of crf(1) receptors is observed in the amygdala following a history of dependence, and crf antagonists selectively block emotionality, excessive alcohol drinking and stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in post-dependent animals. innate upregulation of crf(1) receptor expression mimics the post-dependent phenotype, both with regard to emotional responses and ethanol self-administration. therefore, the crf system is emerging as a key element of the neuroadaptive changes driving alcoholism and as a major target for its treatment.
@background a mutation in the suv39h2 gene in labrador retrievers with hereditary nasal parakeratosis (hnpk) provides insights into the epigenetics of keratinocyte differentiation to provide a stable environmental barrier, the epidermis requires an integrated network of cytoskeletal elements and cellular junctions. nevertheless, the epidermis ranks among the body's most dynamic tissues, continually regenerating itself and responding to cutaneous insults. as keratinocytes journey from the basal compartment towards the cornified layers, they completely reorganize their adhesive junctions and cytoskeleton. these architectural components are more than just rivets and scaffolds — they are active participants in epidermal morphogenesis that regulate epidermal polarization, signalling and barrier formation.
@background implementing oral care to reduce aspiration pneumonia amongst patients with dysphagia in a south african setting. swallowing musculature is asymmetrically represented in both motor cortices. stroke affecting the hemisphere with the dominant swallowing projection results in dysphagia and clinical recovery has been correlated with compensatory changes in the previously non-dominant, unaffected hemisphere. this asymmetric bilaterality may explain why up to half of stroke patients are dysphagic and why many will regain a safe swallow over a comparatively short period. despite this propensity for recovery, dysphagia carries a sevenfold increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and is an independent predictor of mortality. the identification, clinical course, pathophysiology, and treatment of dysphagia after stroke are discussed in this review.
@method cross-sectional area of the lumbar back muscles as a function of torso flexion. the attachments and orientation of every fascicle of the lumbar erector spinae were determined in five cadavers and recorded radiographically. little variation was found in the sites of muscle attachment, which enabled the construction of maps whereby these sites could be plotted on clinical radiographs or models of the lumbar spine. when all fascicles were plotted on 21 clinical radiographs using the maps previously developed, no significant difference in the orientation of fascicles was found compared with that observed in cadavers. this result vindicates the technique used to plot the location of individual fascicles of the lumbar back muscles.
@background overexpression of atogg1, a dna glycosylase/ap lyase, enhances seed longevity and abiotic stress tolerance in arabidopsis. repair of the ubiquitous mutagenic lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxog) is initiated in eukaryotes by dna glycosylases/lyases, such as yeast ogg1, that do not share significant sequence identity with their prokaryotic counterparts, typified by escherichia coli mutm (fpg) protein. the unexpected presence of a functional mutm orthologue in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has brought into question the existence of functional ogg1 orthologues in plants. we report here the cdna cloning, expression and functional characterization of atogg1, an arabidopsisthaliana gene widely expressed in different plant tissues which encodes a 40.3 kda protein with significant sequence identity to yeast and human ogg1 proteins. purified atogg1 enzyme specifically cleaves duplex dna containing an 8-oxog:c mispair, and the repair reaction proceeds through an imine intermediate characteristic of all bifunctional dna glycosylases/lyases. consistent with its in vitro activity, expression of atogg1 suppresses the mutator phenotype of an e. coli strain deficient in 8-oxog repair. our results suggest that atogg1 is an structural and functional homologue of ogg1 and establish the presence of two distinct 8-oxog repair enzymes in arabidopsis.
@method testing matrix function algorithms using identities an algorithm for computing matrix functions is presented. it employs a schur decomposition with reordering and blocking followed by the block form of a recurrence of parlett, with functions of the nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a taylor series. a parameter is used to balance the conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks large. the algorithm is intended primarily for functions having a taylor series with an infinite radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for certain other functions, such as the logarithm. novel features introduced here include a convergence test that avoids premature termination of the taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for reordering and blocking the schur form. numerical experiments show that the algorithm is competitive with existing special-purpose algorithms for the matrix exponential, logarithm, and cosine. nevertheless, the algorithm can be numerically unstable with the default choice of its blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all choices), and we explain why determining the optimal parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. a matlab implementation is available that is much more reliable than the function funm in matlab 6.5 (r13).
@result effect of oral supplementation of putrescine and l-glutamine on the histomorphology of small intestine and growth performance in broiler chickens previous studies have shown that the feeding of putrescine, a biogenic amine and the precursor of the mammalian polyamines, can promote whole-body growth of chicks. the current study was undertaken to determine the effect of spermine, also a biogenic amine and the most cationic of the polyamines, under similar conditions. in exp. 1, 120 week-old chicks were fed purified crystalline amino acid-based diets containing 0, .2, .4, .6, .8, or 1.0% spermine for 14 d. spermine proved highly toxic and growth rates were reduced compared with controls when even .2% was fed. in exp. 2, chicks were fed 0, .0375, .0750, or .1000% spermine. these concentrations proved less toxic than those used in exp. 1. supplemental dietary cysteine was then provided at 0, .3, .6, and .9% together with 0, .025, .050, or .400% spermine (exp. 3) because depletion of cellular glutathione has been suggested as contributing to spermine's toxicity. even high levels of cysteine supplementation did not overcome spermine's toxicity. subsequent dietary provision of l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (otc, exp. 4), a cysteine prodrug, showed that depletion of cellular glutathione was not likely a cause of spermine toxicosis. a trend toward increased weight gain and feed efficiency was observed when low concentrations of spermine were fed. it was concluded, however, that dietary spermine was more toxic to chicks than was previously seen for putrescine, that any growth-promoting effects of dietary spermine are small, and that supplements of dietary cysteine or otc are unlikely to increase these effects by overcoming spermine toxicosis.
@background factors affecting 5- and 10-year survival of women with breast cancer: an analysis based on a public general hospital in barcelona. chemotherapy and hormone therapy prolong disease-free and overall survival for patients with breast cancer in the clinical-trial setting, but it is not clear if this translates into a benefit on a population basis. it is also not clear if surgical caseload has any influence on survival. we used cancer-registry data from 12,861 patients with breast cancer treated in yorkshire, uk, between 1979 and 1988, and found that patients of surgeons with higher rates of usage of chemotherapy and hormone therapy (regional mean usage 9.3%, range 0-46%) had prolonged survival. there was considerable variation in survival of breast cancer patients between surgeons, but their rate of use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy explained about 26% of this survival variation. had the practice of the surgeons with the better outcomes been used by all treating clinicians, 5-year survival would have increased by about 4-5%. examination of differences in survival as a function of consultant caseload demonstrated poorer results amongst those surgeons treating less than 30 new cases of breast cancer per year (risk ratio [95% ci] for treating > 30 compared with < 10 = 0.85 [0.77-0.93]). we recommend that patients with breast cancer be dealt with only by clinicians who see more than 30 new cases per year and who have a full range of treatment options available within a multidisciplinary setting.
@method variability among cucurbitaceae species (melon, cucumber and watermelon) in a genomic region containing a cluster of nbs-lrr genes mcscan is an algorithm able to scan multiple genomes or subgenomes in order to identify putative homologous chromosomal regions, and align these regions using genes as anchors. the mcscanx toolkit implements an adjusted mcscan algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for visualization of results and additional downstream analyses. applications of mcscanx to several sequenced plant genomes and gene families are shown as examples. mcscanx can be used to effectively analyze chromosome structural changes, and reveal the history of gene family expansions that might contribute to the adaptation of lineages and taxa. an integrated view of various modes of gene duplication can supplement the traditional gene tree analysis in specific families. the source code and documentation of mcscanx are freely available at http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/.
@background verbal memory and visual perception in early alzheimer’s disease: contribution of new diagnostic tools for new classification criteria the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
@background adynamic bone decreases bone toughness during aging by affecting mineral and matrix backgroundbone mass, geometry, and tissue material properties contribute to bone structural integrity. thus, bone strength arises from both bone quantity and quality. bone quality encompasses the geometric and material factors that contribute to fracture resistance.questions/purposesthis review presents an overview of the methods for assessing bone quality across multiple length scales, their outcomes, and their relative advantages and disadvantages.methodsa pubmed search was conducted to identify methods related to bone mechanical testing, imaging, and compositional analysis. using various exclusion criteria, articles were selected for inclusion.resultsmethods for assessing mechanical properties include whole-bone, bulk tissue, microbeam, and micro- and nanoindentation testing techniques. outcomes include structural strength and material modulus. advantages include direct assessment of bone strength; disadvantages include specimen destruction during testing. methods for characterizing bone geometry and microarchitecture include quantitative ct, high-resolution peripheral quantitative ct, high-resolution mri, and micro-ct. outcomes include three-dimensional whole-bone geometry, trabecular morphology, and tissue mineral density. the primary advantage is the ability to image noninvasively; disadvantages include the lack of a direct measure of bone strength. methods for measuring tissue composition include scanning electron microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and chemical and physical analytical techniques. outcomes include mineral density and crystallinity, elemental composition, and collagen crosslink composition. advantages include the detailed material characterization; disadvantages include the need for a biopsy.conclusionsalthough no single method can completely characterize bone quality, current noninvasive imaging techniques can be combined with ex vivo mechanical and compositional techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of bone quality.
@background magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for uterine fibroids. one of the most recent additions to the methods for image-guided therapy is magnetic resonance (mr)-guided focused ultrasound. this method represents a unique closed-loop therapy, with planning, guidance, control, and direct feedback (called mr thermometry), which work together to ensure an effective therapy. the focused ultrasound induces focal tissue destruction by thermocoagulation in a noninvasive manner. mr also enables real-time thermometry to be performed during each and every sonication. these characteristics make mr-guided focused ultrasound an exciting new approach for treating fibroids. fibroids are diagnosed based on findings from the patient's physical examination supplemented by imaging results. mr imaging is preferred to other imaging modalities because it enables the fibroids and the entire pelvis to be fully examined. after individual fibroids are identified and the target area is defined by the radiologist, the target volume is analyzed in a three-dimensional assessment to ensure the patient's safety. the procedure begins with the delivery of low-power sonication, and the power is gradually increased until the therapeutic dose is reached. after the procedure, postcontrast images are acquired; these should demonstrate tissue necrosis. the results of clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe, effective, and highly acceptable to patients.
@method polarized secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by retinal pigment epithelium derived from induced pluripotent stem cells during wound healing. pluripotent stem cells possess the ability to proliferate indefinitely and to differentiate into almost any cell type. additionally, the development of techniques to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells has generated interest and excitement towards the possibility of customized personal regenerative medicine. however, the efficiency of stem cell differentiation towards a desired lineage remains low. the purpose of this study is to describe a protocol to derive retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) from ips cells (ips-rpe) by applying a tissue engineering approach to generate homogenous populations of embryoid bodies (ebs), a common intermediate during in vitro differentiation. the protocol applies the formation of specific size of ebs using microwell plate technology. the methods for identifying protein and gene markers of rpe by immunocytochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) are also explained. finally, the efficiency of differentiation in different sizes of ebs monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis of rpe markers is described. these techniques will facilitate the differentiation of ips cells into rpe for future applications.
@background a unique role of rgs9-2 in the striatum as a positive or negative regulator of opiate analgesia a subfamily of regulators of g protein signaling (rgs) proteins consisting of rgs6, -7, -9, and -11 is characterized by the presence of a unique ggamma-like domain through which they form obligatory dimers with the g protein subunit gbeta5 in vivo. in caenorhabditis elegans, orthologs of gbeta5.rgs dimers are implicated in regulating both galphai and galphaq signaling, and in cell-based assays these dimers regulate galphai/o- and galphaq/11-mediated pathways. however, initial studies with purified gbeta5.rgs6 or gbeta5.rgs7 showed that they only serve as gtpase activating proteins for galphao. pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation with these dimers failed to detect their binding to either galphao or galphaq, indicating that the interaction might require additional factors present in vivo. here, we asked if the rgs7.gbeta5 complex binds to galphaq using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) in transiently transfected mammalian cells. rgs7, gbeta5, and galpha subunits were tagged with yellow variants of green fluorescent protein. first we confirmed the functional activity of the fusion proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and also their effect on signaling. second, we again demonstrate the interaction between rgs7 and gbeta5 using fret. finally, using both fret spectroscopy on cell suspensions and microscopy of individual cells, we showed fret between the yellow fluorescence protein-tagged rgs7.gbeta5 complex and cyan fluorescence protein-tagged galphaq, indicating a direct interaction between these molecules.
@background biphasic control logic of hamp domain signalling in the escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor regulation of the direction of flagellar rotation is central to the mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis. the transitions between counterclockwise and clockwise rotation are controlled by a "switch complex" composed of three proteins (flig, flim, and flin) and located at the base of the flagellar motor. the mechanism of function of the switch is unknown. here we demonstrate that the diffusible clockwise-signal molecule, the chey protein, binds to the switch, that the primary docking site is flim, that the extent of chey binding to flim is dependent upon the phosphorylation level of chey, and that it is unaffected by the other two switch proteins. this study provides a biochemical demonstration of binding of a signal molecule to the bacterial switch and demonstrates directly that phosphorylation regulates the activity of this molecule.
@background evaluation and analysis of data driven in expectation maximization segmentation through various initialization techniques in medical images an integration of a minimal spanning tree (mst) based graph-theoretic technique and expectation maximization (em) algorithm with rough set initialization is described for non-convex clustering. em provides the statistical model of the data and handles the associated uncertainties. rough set theory helps in faster convergence and avoidance of the local minima problem, thereby enhancing the performance of em. mst helps in determining non-convex clusters. since it is applied on gaussians rather than the original data points, time required is very low. these features are demonstrated on real life datasets. comparison with related methods is made in terms of a cluster quality measure and computation time.
@background precise regulation of gene expression dynamics favors complex promoter architectures information-carrying signals in the real world are often obscured by noise. a challenge for any system is to filter the signal from the corrupting noise. this task is particularly acute for the signal transduction network that mediates bacterial chemotaxis, because the signals are subtle, the noise arising from stochastic fluctuations is substantial, and the system is effectively acting as a differentiator which amplifies noise. here, we investigated the filtering properties of this biological system. through simulation, we first show that the cutoff frequency has a dramatic effect on the chemotactic efficiency of the cell. then, using a mathematical model to describe the signal, noise, and system, we formulated and solved an optimal filtering problem to determine the cutoff frequency that bests separates the low-frequency signal from the high-frequency noise. there was good agreement between the theory, simulations, and published experimental data. finally, we propose that an elegant implementation of the optimal filter in combination with a differentiator can be achieved via an integral control system. this paper furnishes a simple quantitative framework for interpreting many of the key notions about bacterial chemotaxis, and, more generally, it highlights the constraints on biological systems imposed by noise.
@background varicella zoster virus infection after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in children using a relatively short duration of acyclovir prophylaxis to evaluate the efficacy of long‐term prophylaxis with ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir against varicella‐zoster virus (vzv) reactivation, we analyzed the records of 242 japanese adult patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the first time from 1995 to 2006 at our hospital. we started long‐term oral acyclovir at 200 mg/day in july 2001. acyclovir was continued until the end of immunosuppressive therapy and at least 1 year after transplantation. sixty‐six patients developed vzv reactivation at a median of 248 days after hsct, with a cumulative incidence of 34.7%. only one breakthrough reactivation occurred during long‐term acyclovir, which responded well to therapeutic dose of valacyclovir. the use of long‐term acyclovir was the only independent determinant that significantly decreased the overall incidence of vzv reactivation (20% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001). with this prophylaxis, visceral dissemination and serious complications other than post‐herpetic neuralgia was completely eliminated, and thereby need for hospitalization was significantly reduced (21% vs. 71%, p = 0.0034). fifteen of the 57 patients who discontinued acyclovir developed vzv reactivation, with a cumulative incidence of 32.1%. vzv reactivation following discontinuation tended to occur in patients who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the cessation of acyclovir. these findings suggested that long‐term prophylaxis of ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir resulted in a successful prevention of severe vzv‐related symptoms and death, with a significantly decreased overall incidence of vzv reactivation. prolongation of prophylactic acyclovir on profound immunosuppression might be important for thorough suppression of vzv reactivation. am. j. hematol., 2008. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background nonstructural nipah virus c protein regulates both the early host proinflammatory response and viral virulence abstract we have generated a recombinant newcastle disease virus (ndv) that expresses the green fluorescence protein (gfp) in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (cefs). this virus is interferon (ifn) sensitive, and pretreatment of cells with chicken alpha/beta ifn (ifn-α/β) completely blocks viral gfp expression. prior transfection of plasmid dna induces an ifn response in cefs and blocks ndv-gfp replication. however, transfection of known inhibitors of the ifn-α/β system, including the influenza a virus ns1 protein and the ebola virus vp35 protein, restores ndv-gfp replication. we therefore conclude that the ndv-gfp virus could be used to screen proteins expressed from plasmids for the ability to counteract the host cell ifn response. using this system, we show that expression of the ndv v protein or the nipah virus v, w, or c proteins rescues ndv-gfp replication in the face of the transfection-induced ifn response. the v and w proteins of nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen in humans, also block activation of an ifn-inducible promoter in primate cells. interestingly, the amino-terminal region of the nipah virus v protein, which is identical to the amino terminus of nipah virus w, is sufficient to exert the ifn-antagonist activity. in contrast, the anti-ifn activity of the ndv v protein appears to be located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein, a region implicated in the ifn-antagonist activity exhibited by the v proteins of mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2.
@method putative ephx1 enzyme activity is related with risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers: a comprehensive meta-analysis exposure to aflatoxins is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). aflatoxins occur in peanut butter and are metabolized by genetically polymorphic enzymes such as glutathione-s-transferases encoded by glutathione-s-transferase mu 1 gene (gstm1) and glutathione-s-transferase theta 1 gene (gstt1) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase encoded by epoxide hydrolase gene (ephx). the rate at which aflatoxins become activated or detoxified may depend on polymorphisms in the encoding genes. gstm1 homozygous deletion was indeed found to modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in this study, we investigate possible roles of gstt1 and ephx polymorphisms in this relationship. from a sudanese case-control study on hcc, we analyzed data of 112 incident cases and 194 controls. all participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire inquiring about social and demographic factors, peanut butter consumption, and other known hcc risk factors. univariate analysis showed that gstt1 polymorphism was not associated with hcc, whereas ephx 113hh and 139hh genotypes increased the risk of hcc (odds ratio, 3.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.12). adjustment for age and region of origin slightly attenuated this association (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-7.95). interestingly, unlike gstm1, both gstt1 and ephx polymorphism did not modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in conclusion, these epidemiological findings do not suggest significant roles of gstt1 and ephx in aflatoxin metabolism, although ephx polymorphism is possibly related to the increased risk of hcc. further studies are needed to investigate mechanisms by which the ephx polymorphism potentially modifies cancer risk.
@background role of nitric oxide mechanisms in control of pyloric motility and transpyloric flow of liquids in conscious dogs antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
@background wild bee nutritional ecology: predicting pollinator population dynamics, movement, and services from floral resources. global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable crop production. provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. recent government incentives in north america and europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in north america there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. we tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of north america where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: florida, michigan, and california. in each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. we measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. in each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. by partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of north america. no mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.
@result nos 2 regulation of lps-induced airway inflammation via s-nitrosylation of nf-b p 65 airway s-nitrosothiols (snos) are naturally occurring bronchodilators. snos, nitrate, and nitrite were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and mild pulmonary disease (aged 6-16 years) and 13 healthy children (aged 8-15 years). concentrations of snos were decreased in the lower airways of patients with cf and mild pulmonary disease (median, range: 0, 0-320 nmol/l vs 80, 0-970 nmol/l) despite normal levels of the inert nitric oxide metabolites nitrate and nitrite (mean +/- sem: 3.7 +/- 0.5 micromol/l vs 4.8 +/- 0.9 micromol/l). s-nitrosolation- mediated bioreactivities may be impaired by depletion of the cf airway sno reservoir.
@background molecular characterization of the trka/ngf receptor minimal enhancer reveals regulation by multiple cis elements to drive embryonic neuron expression. multipotential stem cells throughout the developing central nervous system have common properties. among these is expression of the intermediate filament protein nestin and the brain fatty acid binding protein (b-fabp). to determine if common mechanisms control transcription in cns stem cells, the regulatory elements of these two genes were mapped in transgenic mice. a 257 basepair enhancer of the rat nestin gene is sufficient for expression throughout the embryonic neuroepithelium. this enhancer contains two sites bound by the class iii pou proteins brn-1, brn-2, brn-4, and tst-1. only one of the two pou sites is required for cns expression. an adjacent hormone response element is necessary for expression in the dorsal midbrain and forebrain. the regulatory sites of the b-fabp gene are strikingly similar to those of the nestin gene. a hybrid pou/pbx binding site is recognized in vitro by pbx-1, brn-1 and brn-2. this site is essential for expression in most of the cns. in addition, a hormone response element is necessary for forebrain expression. both the nestin and b-fabp genes therefore depend on pou binding sites for general cns expression, with hormone response elements additionally required for activity in the anterior cns. these data indicate that regulation by pou proteins and hormone receptors is a general mechanism for cns stem cell-specific transcription.
@background a comparative study of orthotropic and isotropic bone adaptation in the femur in a companion paper, we presented a time‐dependent theory for bone modeling and remodeling in response to a daily loading history. this paper represents a preliminary attempt to use the theory to determine the distribution of bone density within the adult proximal femur under an assumed normal loading history. subsequent functional adaptation of the internal structure due to changes in the loading history are then determined. throughout this preliminary study, the external geometry of the proximal femur is considered to be fixed, i.e., changes in the external shape are neither stimulated nor allowed. linear and trilinear (dead‐zone nonlinearity) rate remodeling laws were compared. computer emulations using two‐dimensional finite element models were successful in creating a normal‐appearing distribution of bone tissue when remodeling was initiated from a solid structure of homogeneous bone density. subsequent reduction in the loading history caused regional bone atrophy. reinstatement of the normal loading history caused a generalized increase in bone mass but resulted in a slightly different bone distribution than was calculated for a constant loading history. these results demonstrate the utility of the remodeling theory and are consistent with the hypothesis that similar stress‐related phenomena are responsible for both normal morphogenesis and functional adaptiation in response to changes in the bone loading.
@background improved cross-section predictions for heavy charged higgs boson production at the lhc a bstractwe study the production of a higgs boson in association with bottom quarks in hadronic collisions, and present phenomenological predictions relevant to the 13 tev lhc. our results are accurate to the next-to-leading order in qcd, and matched to parton showers through the mc@nlo method; thus, they are fully differential and based on unweighted events, which we shower by using both herwig++ and pythia8. we perform the computation in both the four-flavour and the five-flavour schemes, whose results we compare extensively at the level of exclusive observables. in the case of the higgs transverse momentum, we also consider the analytically-resummed cross section up to the nnlo+nnll accuracy. in addition, we analyse at oαs3$$ \mathcal{o}\left({\alpha}_s^3\right) $$ the effects of the interference between the bb¯h$$ b\overline{b}h $$ and gluon-fusion production modes.
@background expression of cd81, sr‐bi and ldlr in lymphocytes and monocytes from patients with classic and occult hepatitis c virus infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) particles in serum associate with lipoproteins (lps), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) has been implicated in virus attachment and entry into cells. to clarify the basis of interactions between virus and lps, we determined whether hcv interacts with human lps via its envelope glycoprotein e2. the binding of serum-derived virus-like particles, hcv e2, and hcv e2-lp complexes to cd81 and ldlr was studied. incubation of hcv e2 protein with human and bovine lps (very low density, low density, and high density) enhanced the binding of both hcv e2 and lps to cd4+ lymphoblastoid (molt-4) cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. the binding of hcv e2 to molt-4 cells was not enhanced when it was preincubated with lipid-free apoprotein b, which suggests that e2 interacts with the lipid moiety of human lipoproteins. the lp interaction was specific for hcv e2--incubation of hiv gp120 with lps did not enhance gp120 binding to molt-4 cells. the enhanced hcv e2 binding required expression of both human cd81 and ldlr. these data suggest that hcv e2 associates with ldl and that the resulting complex enhances binding of both ligands to cells, which may contribute to the finding that hcv-infected individuals have significantly lower levels of ldl than control subjects.
@method pvac-seq: a genome-guided in silico approach to identifying tumor neoantigens the human leukocyte antigen (hla) is key to many aspects of human physiology and medicine. all current sequence-based hla typing methodologies are targeted approaches requiring the amplification of specific hla gene segments. whole genome, exome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing can generate prodigious data but due to the complexity of hla loci these data have not been immediately informative regarding hla genotype. we describe hlaminer, a computational method for identifying hla alleles directly from shotgun sequence datasets (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/hlaminer). this approach circumvents the additional time and cost of generating hla-specific data and capitalizes on the increasing accessibility and affordability of massively parallel sequencing.
@background arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
@background identification of interlaminar fracture properties of a composite laminate using local full-field kinematic measurements and finite element simulations a new methodology is proposed to estimate displacement fields from pairs of images (reference and strained) that evaluates continuous displacement fields. this approach is specialized to a finite-element decomposition, therefore providing a natural interface with a numerical modeling of the mechanical behavior used for identification purposes. the method is illustrated with the analysis of portevin–le châtelier bands in an aluminum alloy sample subjected to a tensile test. a significant progress with respect to classical digital image correlation techniques is observed in terms of spatial resolution and uncertainty.
@background open treatment of femoroacetabular impingement is associated with clinical improvement and low complication rate at short-term followup background femoro-acetabular impingement has been associated with acetabular labral and/or articular cartilage damage that may ultimately result in osteoarthritis of the hip. surgical treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement is directed at restoring a more normal femoral head-neck offset to alleviate femoral abutment against the acetabular rim and treating associated labral and articular cartilage damage.   methods thirty hips with femoro-acetabular impingement (in twenty-nine patients) underwent débridement through a greater trochanteric flip osteotomy and anterior dislocation of the femoral head. there were sixteen male patients and thirteen female patients with a mean age of thirty-one years. cam (femoral based) impingement was noted in fourteen hips; pincer (acetabular based) impingement, in one hip; and combined cam and pincer impingement, in fifteen hips. the mean duration of clinical and radiographic follow-up was thirty-two months. all patients were followed according to a prospective protocol, with harris hip scores and plain radiographs obtained preoperatively and at six months, one year, and annually for a minimum of two years.   results the mean harris hip score improved from 70 points preoperatively to 87 points at the time of final follow-up (p < 0.0001). osteonecrosis did not develop in any hip, and there were no trochanteric nonunions. in eighteen hips, severe damage of the acetabular articular cartilage that had not been appreciated on preoperative plain radiographs or magnetic resonance arthrography was noted on arthrotomy. eight of these eighteen hips subsequently had radiographic evidence of progression of the osteoarthritis, and four of the eight hips required or were expected to soon require conversion to a total hip arthroplasty to treat progressive pain.   conclusions at the time of early follow-up, we found that surgical dislocation and débridement of the hip for the treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement in hips without substantial damage to the articular cartilage can reduce pain and improve function. this procedure has a low rate of complications. radiographic signs of progression of osteoarthritis and clinical failure requiring conversion to a total hip arthroplasty were seen only in patients with severe damage to the acetabular articular cartilage, a finding that emphasizes the need for better imaging methods to assess the extent of damage to the acetabular articular cartilage in patients with this disorder.
@background recurrence and quality of life following perineal proctectomy for rectal prolapse purpose: reports of outcome after surgery for rectal prolapse predominantly relate to single operative procedures. a single surgical operation is not appropriate for all patients with rectal prolapse. we describe a selective policy based on clinical criteria. methods: patients were offered surgery according to the following broad clinical protocol. those who were unfit for abdominal surgery had a perineal operation. the remainder had a suture abdominal rectopexy. a sigmoid resection was added for patients in whom incontinence was not a predominant symptom. results: surgery was performed in 159 patients. of these, 57 had a perineal operation, 65 had fixation rectopexy, and 37 had resection rectopexy. there were no in-hospital deaths, and major complications occurred in five patients (3.5 percent). minimum follow-up was 3 years. of the 143 patients with long-term follow-up, recurrence occurred in 7 (5 percent). constipation increased from 41 to 43 percent (59–61/143) and incontinence decreased from 43 to 19 percent (61 to 27/143). conclusions: a selective policy has improved outcome compared with reports of a single operation. future studies might consider an objective method of selecting the type of operation for rectal prolapse.
@method weighted fair share scheduling for loosely controlled concurrent event systems in this paper, we present an approach for qos management that can be applied to a general class of real-time distributed computation systems. in the proposed approach, a switching hybrid system model is used to represent the system. in this setting, the qos specifications are transformed into set-point specifications and a limited-horizon online supervisory controller is used to move the system to the optimal operation point.
@method protein structural model selection by combining consensus and single scoring methods for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.

@method the representational geometry of word meanings acquired by neural machine translation models we propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. this versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. this work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.

@method network topology-based detection of differential gene regulation and regulatory switches in cell metabolism and signaling metabolism is a vital cellular process, and its malfunction is a major contributor to human disease. metabolic networks are complex and highly interconnected, and thus systems-level computational approaches are required to elucidate and understand metabolic genotype–phenotype relationships. we have manually reconstructed the global human metabolic network based on build 35 of the genome annotation and a comprehensive evaluation of >50 years of legacy data (i.e., bibliomic data). herein we describe the reconstruction process and demonstrate how the resulting genome-scale (or global) network can be used (i) for the discovery of missing information, (ii) for the formulation of an in silico model, and (iii) as a structured context for analyzing high-throughput biological data sets. our comprehensive evaluation of the literature revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. mathematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the context of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of functional metabolic states. these results highlight some of the applications enabled by the reconstructed human metabolic network. the establishment of this network represents an important step toward genome-scale human systems biology.
@method determinants of accelerated small intestinal transit in alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis background: the pattern of progression of a meal from the stomach to the caecum in diabetes mellitus is controversial and the differential roles of transit through the jejunum and the ileum have not been investigated in diabetes. aims: to determine gastric emptying and transit rates through proximal and distal regions of the small bowel in type i diabetic patients. subjects: the study included six diabetic patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy (dm-an group), 11 diabetics without autonomic dysfunction (dm group), and 15 control volunteers. methods: gastric emptying and small bowel transit of a liquid meal were evaluated scintigraphically in these subjects. transit through regions of interest corresponding to the proximal and distal small intestine up to the caecum was determined and correlated with gastric emptying rates, cardiovascular measurements of autonomic function, and the occurrence of diarrhoea. results: gastric emptying and transit through the proximal small bowel were similar in the three groups. the meal arrived to the caecum significantly earlier in dm-an patients (median; range: 55 min; 22-->180 min) than in the dm group (100 min; 44-->180 min, p < 0.05) or in controls (120 min; 80-->180 min, p < 0.02). accumulation of chyme in the distal small bowel was decreased in dm-an patients, who showed values for peak activity (30%; 10-55%) significantly lower than in the dm group (49%; 25-77%, p = 0.02) and controls (50%; 30-81%, p = 0.02). in dm patients (n = 17), the time of meal arrival to the caecum was significantly correlated with both orthostatic hypotension (coefficient of contingency, c = 0.53, p < 0.01) and diarrhoea (c = 0.47, p < 0.05), but not with gastric emptying rates. conclusions: patients with type i diabetes mellitus and sympathetic denervation have abnormally rapid transit of a liquid meal through the distal small bowel, which may play a part in diarrhoea production.
@background thiolase engineering for enhanced butanol production in clostridium acetobutylicum the primary alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (coded by the aad gene) is responsible for butanol formation in clostridium acetobutylicum. we complemented the non-sporulating, non-solvent-producing c. acetobutylicum m5 strain (which has lost the psol1 megaplasmid containing aad and the acetone-formation genes) with aad expressed from the phosphotransbutyrylase promoter and restored butanol production to wild type levels. because no acetone was produced, no acids (acetate or butyrate) were re-assimilated leading to high butyrate but especially acetate levels. to counter acetate production, we examined thiolase overexpression in order reduce the acetyl-coa pool and enhance the butyryl-coa pool. we combined thiolase overexpression with aad overexpression aiming to also enhance butanol formation. while limiting the formation of acetate and ethanol, the butanol titers were not improved. we also generated acetate kinase (ak) and butyrate kinase (bk) knockout (ko) mutants of m5 using a modified protocol to increase the antibiotic-resistance gene expression. these strains exhibited greater than 60% reduction in acetate or butyrate formation, respectively. we complemented the akko m5 strain with aad overexpression, but could not successfully transform the bkko m5 strain. the akko m5 strain overexpressing aad produced less acetate, but also less butanol compared to the m5 aad overexpression strain. these data suggest that loss of the psol1 megaplasmid renders cells resistant to changes in the two acid-formation pathways, and especially so for butyrate formation. we argue that the difficulty in generating high butanol producers without acetone and acid production is hindered by the inability to control the electron flow, which appears to be affected by unknown psol1 genes.
@background toward understanding the dynamics of microbial communities in an estuarine system the metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. here we review current understanding about this concept. we first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. we then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. these have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. we then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. as ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.
@method potential range of the invasive fish rotan (perccottus glenii) in the holarctic determining the spread and potential geographical distribution of invasive species is integral to making invasion biology a predictive science. we assembled a dataset of over 1000 occurrences of the argentine ant (linepithema humile), one of the world's worst invasive alien species. native to central south america, argentine ants are now found in many mediterranean and subtropical climates around the world. we used this dataset to assess the species' potential geographical and ecological distribution, and to examine changes in its distributional potential associated with global climate change, using techniques for ecological niche modelling. models developed were highly predictive of the species' overall range, including both the native distributional area and invaded areas worldwide. despite its already widespread occurrence, l. humile has potential for further spread, with tropical coastal africa and southeast asia apparently vulnerable to invasion. projecting ecological niche models onto four general circulation model scenarios of future (2050s) climates provided scenarios of the species' potential for distributional expansion with warming climates: generally, the species was predicted to retract its range in tropical regions, but to expand at higher latitude areas.
@result inhibitory effect of the essential oil from chamaecyparis obtusa on the growth of food-borne pathogens essential oil from achillea fragrantissima exerted a bactericidic effect on several gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains, as well as on candida albicans. the oil was fractionated on sillica gel columns by a gradient of ether in petrol ether (30 degrees c-40 degrees c). two fractions which contained less polar compounds were active against c. albicans only. the fractions which contained more polar compounds inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms tested. one of these compounds was identified as terpinen-4-ol. commercial terpinen-4-ol had a similar antimicrobial activity.
@background sulfated polysaccharide, curdlan sulfate, efficiently prevents entry/fusion and restricts antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in vitro: a possible candidate for clinical application preclinical studies have shown that curdlan sulphate (crds), a sulphated 1-->3-beta-d glucan, inhibits plasmodium falciparum in vitro and down-modulates the immune response. a direct, non-specific effect on cytoadherence and rosetting may be predicted, as has been described with other sulphated polysaccharides, e.g. heparin. the anticoagulant effect of crds is 10-fold lower than heparin. curdlan sulphate has, therefore, emerged as a candidate for adjunct medication in the treatment of severe/cerebral malaria. two clinical studies were conducted using crds as adjunct medication to conventional therapy (artesunate) in patients with severe and severe/cerebral malaria. both studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination. curdlan sulphate appeared to reduce the severity of the disease process, e.g. fever clearance time was shortened. due to the small number of patients, there was no difference in mortality. the two treatment arms in both studies showed similar results for all laboratory parameters. the only adverse event recorded during crds treatment was an increase in activated partial thromboplastin time. this can be monitored easily. it seems that the patients who may benefit most are severe/cerebral cases with no organ damage on admission.
@background why is my classifier discriminatory? algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. in some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. to mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. we show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. we further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. the unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. by examining data from broward county, florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. we focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.
@background persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in santa monica bay beach sediments. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
@result surgical strategy for clinical stage i non-small cell lung cancer in octogenarians. background octogenarians often present with potentially resectable bronchogenic carcinoma. older reports noting prohibitive mortality and recent surveys documenting continued substantial risk raise concerns about the applicability of operation in this age group.   methods we reviewed the short-term and long-term results of pulmonary resection for intended cure of lung cancer in patients 80 years and older operated on from 1980 through 1995. our surgical philosophy favored lobectomy over lesser resection and generally avoided pneumonectomy in the elderly.   results fifty-four octogenarians underwent resection: 43 lobectomies, 2 extended lobectomies, 2 bilobectomies, 3 segmentectomies, 3 wedge excisions, and 1 pneumonectomy. there were two perioperative deaths (3.7%). the overall nonfatal complication rate was 42%, with a major complication rate of 11%. postoperative stay decreased from 8.1 days overall to 6.3 days in the last 3 years. only 3 patients required temporary convalescent care after discharge. actuarial survival at 1,3, and 5 years was 86%, 62%, and 43%, respectively, for all discharged patients (n = 52) and 97%, 78%, and 57% for stage i cases (n = 39). patients with tumors beyond stage i fared poorly.   conclusions advanced age per se in neither a contraindication to curative resection nor a routine indication for nonanatomic operations in healthy octogenarians with stage i lung cancer. with proper selection, acute risk should be low. pneumonectomy, extended resection, and operation for stage ii or iii disease should be considered only in exceptional cases.
@method mono and dual species biofilm formation between lactobacillus pentosus and pichia membranifaciens on the surface of black olives under different sterile brine conditions this work examines the formation of poly-microbial communities adhered to the surface of manzanilla olive fruits processed according to the spanish style. the experimental design consisted of four pilot fermenters inoculated with four lactobacillus pentosus strains, plus another fermenter which was not inoculated and fermented spontaneously. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were analysed in depth on olive epidermis throughout fermentation by plate count, molecular techniques and scanning electron microscopy. data show that in all cases high population levels (above 8 log(10) cfu per olive) were reached for both groups of microorganisms at the second week of fermentation and that these counts never fell below 6 log(10) cfu per olive during the 3 months that fermenters were monitored. in situ observation of olive epidermis slices revealed a strong aggregation and adhesion between bacteria and yeasts by the formation of a matrix which embedded the microorganisms. geotrichum candidum, pichia galeiformis and candida sorbosa were the main yeast species isolated from these biofilms at the end of fermentation (confirmed by rflp analysis of the 5.8s-its region), while molecular characterization of lactobacilli isolates by means of rapd-pcr with primer opl(5) showed in many cases a high similarity in their banding profiles with the inoculated strains. results obtained in this survey show the importance of studying the olive epidermis throughout fermentation, because ultimately, olives are ingested by consumers.
@background humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
@background gene‐by‐diet interactions influence calcium absorption and bone density in mice optimal intestinal calcium (ca) absorption is necessary for the protection of bone and the prevention of osteoporosis. ca absorption can be represented as the sum of a saturable pathway and a non-saturable pathway that is primarily dependent upon luminal ca concentration. while models have been proposed to describe these transport components, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of these processes. habitual low intake of ca up-regulates the saturable transport pathway, a process mediated by increased renal production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d). consistent with this, low vitamin d status as well as deletion/mutation of the vitamin d receptor (vdr) or 25 hydroxyvitamin d-1α hydroxylase (cyp27b1) genes limit ca absorption by reducing the saturable pathway. there is some evidence that non-saturable ca absorption in the ileum is also regulated by vitamin d status, but the mechanism is unclear. treatment with a number of hormones can regulate ca absorption in vivo (e.g. parathyroid hormone (pth), thyroid hormone, growth hormone (gh)/insulin-like growth factor i (igf-1), estrogen, testosterone). however, some of these actions are indirect (i.e. mediated through the regulation of vitamin d metabolism or signaling), whereas only a few (e.g. estrogen, igf-1) have been shown to persist in the absence of vitamin d signaling.
@result drug interaction between celecoxib and methotrexate in organic anion transporter 3-transfected renal cells and in rats in vivo. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib was determined for animals and humans using in vitro and ex vivo methods. eight, healthy, human volunteers (three male, five female, 20–39 years) received celecoxib (600 mg) bid for 7 days, blood samples were collected and concentrations of bound and unbound celecoxib determined. the fraction of bound drug in the volunteers was constant (97.4±0.1%) at total celecoxib plasma concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 4.02 μg/ml. the ex vivo plasma protein binding of celecoxib in the animals was concentration‐independent up to approximately 12, 8 and 10 μg/ml for mouse, rat and dog, respectively. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib after a single oral dose of 10 and 300 mg/kg to mice was 98.3±0.2%, of 1 and 400 mg/kg to rats was 98.3±0.2% and of 1 and 100 mg/kg to dogs was 98.5±0.1%. the percent binding of celecoxib to plasma proteins in vitro was slightly lower than those values determined ex vivo. the in vitro binding of celecoxib to plasma protein was constant over the concentrations of 0.1–10 μg/ml for all species, except rat. copyright © 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.
@method opposing effects of 5,7-dht lesions to the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens on the processing of irrelevant stimuli the roles of norepinephrine (ne) and serotonin (5-ht) were assessed by comparing the effect of their depletion on the associability of stimuli. ne and 5-ht depleted rats and vehicle controls were assigned to two training conditions and to a control condition. in each of the training conditions rats were pre-exposed to a single stimulus prior to conditioning to a compound stimulus formed from the pre-exposed cue and a new stimulus. the training conditions differed only in the order of testing of each of the stimuli following training. rats assigned to the control condition received only compound conditioning before the associability of each cue was assessed. the findings show that: (a) vehicle rats in the training tasks evidence superconditioning: the associative strength of the new element exceeds that of the pre-exposed cue; (b) equivalent associative strength was found with either cue regardless of their testing order for ne depleted rats; and (c) 5-ht depleted rats did not show superconditioning: the pre-exposed cue competes with the new cue for available associative strength.
@method evidence for coral range expansion accompanied by reduced diversity of symbiodinium genotypes a protocol that takes advantage of length heteroplasmy in domain v of chloroplast large subunit (cp23s)–ribosomal dna to identify members of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus symbiodinium is presented. this protocol is highly specific for symbiodinium, can provide intercladal and intracladal identification of a particular symbiodinium isolate, and can detect multiple symbiodinium chloroplast genotypes simultaneously in the same isolate, making his technique attractive for a variety of research questions. we used this technique to characterize variation among symbiodinium populations associated with a range of phylogenetically diverse and geographically discrete hosts. we also examined symbiont variation within a single host, the caribbean gorgonian pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, from 9 sites in the bahamas, and we report a previously undocumented level of symbiont specificity for particular members of symbiodinium clade b in this gorgonian.
@background molecular differences between chronic and aggressive periodontitis jdr in recent years, molecular research has translated into remarkable changes for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. molecular tests such as oncotype dx® and mammaprint® have revolutionized the predictive and prognostic tools in the clinic. by stratifying the risk of recurrence for patients, the tests are able to provide clinicians with more information on the treatment outcomes of using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or combination therapies for patients with genetic expression patterns. however, it is still questionable for clinical applications as some areas remain unclear; the true benefit still needs prospective evaluation. in this paper, the limitation and the possibility to replace traditional histopathologic features of molecular tests are discussed. at the moment, it seems there are still limitations that prevent microarrays from replacing the microscope for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of early breast cancer. however, additional important clinical information is added to traditional histology and ihc determination of er, pr and her2 in terms of prognostic and predictive power.
@result effectiveness of learner-regulated study sequence: an in-vivo study in introductory psychology course kornell and bjork (psychological science 19:585–592, 2008) found that interleaving exemplars of different categories enhanced inductive learning of the concepts based on those exemplars. they hypothesized that the benefit of mixing exemplars from different categories is that doing so highlights differences between the categories. kang and pashler (applied cognitive psychology 26:97–103, 2012) obtained results consistent with this discriminative-contrast hypothesis: interleaving enhanced inductive learning, but temporal spacing, which does not highlight category differences, did not. we further tested the discriminative-contrast hypothesis by examining the effects of interleaving and spacing, as well as their combined effects. in three experiments, using photographs of butterflies and birds as the stimuli, temporal spacing was harmful when it interrupted the juxtaposition of interleaved categories, even when total spacing was held constant, supporting the discriminative-contrast hypothesis. temporal spacing also had value, however, when it did not interrupt discrimination processing.
@result the cholesterol-complexing agent digitonin modulates ligand binding of the bovine hippocampal serotonin1a receptor to investigate the effect of cholesterol on the oxytocin receptor function in myometrial membranes, we developed a new method to alter the membrane cholesterol content. using a methyl-substituted beta-cyclodextrin, we were able to selectively deplete the myometrial plasma membrane of cholesterol. vice versa, incubating cholesterol-depleted membranes with a preformed soluble cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex restored the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane. binding experiments showed that, with the removal of cholesterol from the membrane, the dissociation constant for [3h]oxytocin is enhanced 87-fold (from kd = 1.5 nm to kd = 131 nm), therefore shifting the oxytocin receptor from high to low affinity. increasing the cholesterol content of the cholesterol-depleted membrane again restored the high-affinity binding (kd = 1.2 nm). the presence of 0.1 mm gtp gamma s did not significantly change the number of high-affinity binding sites for [3h]oxytocin in native plasma membranes, in membranes depleted of cholesterol, and in plasma membranes with restored cholesterol content. the number of high-affinity binding sites for the oxytocin antagonist [3h]prota was dependent in the same way on the cholesterol content as for [3h]oxytocin. substitution of the membrane cholesterol with other steroids showed a strong dependence of the oxytocin receptor function on the structure of the cholesterol molecule. the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor was not saturable with [3h]oxytocin even at concentrations up to 10(-6) m of radioligand. addition of the cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex to the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor induced a saturation of the solubilized binding sites (bmax = 0.98 pmol/mg) for oxytocin (kd = 16 nm).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
@background the expression of lep, lepr, igf1 and il10 in obesity and the relationship with micrornas objectives: we investigated the effect of obesity on the serum levels of total and free igf-1 and their relationship to the circulating levels of insulin and igf binding proteins (igfbps) in age and sex-matched groups. subjects: the study included 43 obese subjects (ideal body weight; ibw>120%) and 45 controls (ibw<100%). all of the subjects were male. measurement: total igf-1, free igf-1, igfbp-1, igfbp-2, igfbp-3, and insulin were measured in obese subjects and normal control subjects. results: no significant differences in the circulating levels of total and igfbp-3 were observed between the obese and control groups. in contrast to total igf-1, free igf-1 in obese subjects was significantly increased compared to normal controls (p<0.05). serum total and free igf-1 were inversely correlated with age (r=−0.42, p=0.001, and −0.44, p=0.001). fasting serum insulin concentrations were elevated in all the obese subjects (p<0.05) and positively correlated with ibw (r=0.57, p=0.001). the levels of serum gh and igfbp-1 were suppressed in all the obese subjects (p<0.05). igfbp-1 was inversely correlated with ibw (r=−0.51, p=0.001) and serum insulin concentrations (r=minus;0.48, p=0.001). the igfbp-2 concentrations were also suppressed in obese subjects and inversely related to free igf-1 (r=−0.48, p=0.001). using multiple linear regression analysis, total igf-1 and insulin concentrations were positively correlated (r=0.58, p=0.001) and free igf-1 and igfbp-1 concentrations were negatively correlated (r=−0.57, p=0.001). conclusion: we confirmed that total igf-1 and igfbp-3 concentrations were not significantly different between the obese and control groups, despite gh hyposecretion in obesity. we also found that free igf-1 concentrations were higher in obese subjects than in normal controls. it seems likely that overnutrition and chronic hyperinsulinaemia in obesity may alter this regulated growth response by insulin stimulation of igf-1 production and suppression of hepatic igfbp-1 and igfbp-2 production, which may inhibit igf-1 bioactivity.
@background als-causing mutations significantly perturb the self-assembly and interaction with nucleic acid of the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain of tdp-43 glutamine/asparagine (q/n)-rich domains have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils. this phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. to examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for q/n-rich regions. we found that q/n-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. moreover, the average q/n content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with q/n-rich regions. remarkably, q/n-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular "polar zipper" protein-protein interaction domains. these data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.
@background complete pathological response following neoadjuvant folfirinox in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer - a case report and review background pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pda) has a very poor prognosis. treatment with folfirinox has been shown to improve outcomes, but can be associated with significant toxicity.   materials and methods a retrospective review was performed of all patients with locally advanced or metastatic pda treated with folfirinox at the royal marsden between november 2010 and november 2013. efficacy, tolerability, and potential prognostic factors were evaluated.   results twenty-seven patients with metastatic pda and 22 patients with locally advanced pda were treated with folfirinox. patients received a median of 9 cycles (range, 1-26) of folfirinox. the overall response rate was 41% (20 patients), and a further 17 patients (35%) had stable disease. thirty-five patients (71%) received folfirinox in the first-line setting, with a median progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively, of 12.9 months and 18.4 months for patients with locally advanced disease; and 8.4 months and 12.2 months for patients with metastatic disease. the most frequently occurring grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (29%), fatigue (18%), febrile neutropenia (14%), thromboembolism (12%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). in a univariate analysis, reduction in ca 19-9 of >50% (p < .001), normalization of ca19-9 (p < .001), surgery after folfirinox (p = .004), and use of prophylactic pegfilgrastim (p = .005) were prognostic for overall survival.   conclusion the efficacy and tolerability of folfirinox for pda at our institution is similar to that reported in clinical trials. careful selection of patients and monitoring of response (according to ca19-9) and toxicities can help maximize advantage in this patient population.
@background reconsidering the income-illness relationship using distributional regression – an application to germany background. reliably mapping from generic or diseasespecific health status measures into health state utilities would assist health economists. existing studies mainly use ordinary least squares (ols) regression equations to predict utility values for particular health states. the authors examine an alternative approach tomap between 2 generic health status instruments, the sf-12 and the eq-5d. methods. multinomial logit regression is used to estimate the probability that a respondent will select a particular level of response to questions in the eq-5d, using individual question responses and summary scores from the sf-12 as predictors. monte carlo simulation methods are used to generate predicted eq-5d responses, and utility scores (tariffs) are then attached. results are comparedwithanalternativeapproach based on direct mapping to utility scores using ols. data. the authors estimate equations using 12,967 adult survey responses-from the 2000 us medical expenditure panel survey. they report mean squared error (mse) andmean absolute error (mae) of their predicted utilitieswithin this sample, and out-of-sample using 13,304 adults from the 1996 health survey for england. results. the authors obtain an in-sample and out-of-sample mse of 0.03, compared with 0.02 for the ols approach. their mae of 0.11 is similar to ols results. the authors’ method predicts groupmean utility scores and differentiates between groups with or without known existing illness. conclusions. the authors’ approach has higher mse than the direct ols approach but givesmore descriptive data on domains of health effects. further outofsample prediction work will help test the validity of these methods.
@method effects of age and inactivity due to prolonged bed rest on atrophy of trunk muscles study design within-session intrarater and interrater reliability study.   objective to establish the intrarater and interrater reliability of thickness measurements of the multifidus muscle in a parasagittal plane, conducted by an experienced ultrasound operator and a novice assessor.   background there is considerable evidence for the important role of the multifidus muscle in segmental stabilization of the lumbar spine. the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle has been assessed in healthy subjects and patients with low back pain using real-time ultrasound imaging. however, few studies have measured the thickness of the multifidus muscle using a parasagittal view.   methods and measures the thickness of the multifidus muscle was measured at rest, using real-time ultrasound imaging, in 10 subjects without a history of low back pain, at the levels of the l2-3 and l4-5 zygapophyseal joints. the measure was carried out 3 times at each level by 2 assessors (1 experienced, 1 novice). intrarater (model 3) and interrater (model 2) reliability was assessed by calculation of an f statistic (analysis of variance), the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc), and the standard error of measurement (sem).   results on the basis of an average of 3 trials, the 2 operators showed very high interrater agreement on the measurement of thicknesses at the l2-3 level (icc2,3 = 0.96; 95% ci: 0.84 to 0.99) and the l4-5 vertebral level (icc2,3 = 0.97; 95% ci: 0.87 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across operators (p > .05). interrater reliability was relatively lower for the l2-3 level (icc2,1 = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.51 to 0.96) than the l4-5 level (icc2,1 = 0.87; 95% ci: 0.52 to 0.97) when a single trial per rater was used, but these values still indicated a high level of agreement. in addition, the novice and experienced operator produced reliable intrarater measurements at l2-3 (icc3,1 = 0.89; 95% ci: 0.72 to 0.97 and 0.94; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99) and at l4-5 (icc3,1 = 0.88; 95% ci: 0.68 to 0.97 and 0.95; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across trials (p > .05). the consistently low sem values also indicate low measurement error.   conclusion a novice and an experienced assessor were both able to reliably perform this measure at rest for 2 vertebral levels using real-time ultrasound imaging. an average of 3 trials produced higher interrater reliability scores, though using a single trial per rater was also reliable.
@background transformation of pollen embryo-derived explants by agrobacterium tumefaciens in hyoscyamus niger this work describes a new method to obtain transgenic somatic embryos fromagrobacterium-infected immature zygotic embryos ofdatura innoxia. it has several advantages over previous transformation methods such as the absence of a callus phase, an average transformation rate of 76% and a high regeneration frequency. critical steps for optimal transformation were the embryo stage and a short preculture treatment. the marker gene β-glucuronidase and light microscopy were used to identify the competent embryogenic cells which, after transformation, passed through the classical stages of embryo development. the transgenes were transmitted to the progeny in a mendelian fashion. the plants regenerated via direct somatic embryogenesis were cytologically and morphologically uniform. we also observed that: (1) wounding or wound-induced divisions were not required for zygotic embryo transformation; (2) epidermal cells were competent for both transformation and regeneration; and (3) competency foragrobacterium infection was developmental stage-specific. this new method should facilitate the development of new strategies to routinely transform recalcitrant plant species.
@background acute but not chronic stimulation of glial cells in rat spinal cord by systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide is associated with hyperalgesia the most characteristic feature of microglial cells is their rapid activation in response to even minor pathological changes in the cns. microglia activation is a key factor in the defence of the neural parenchyma against infectious diseases, inflammation, trauma, ischaemia, brain tumours and neurodegeneration. microglia activation occurs as a graded response in vivo. the transformation of microglia into potentially cytotoxic cells is under strict control and occurs mainly in response to neuronal or terminal degeneration, or both. activated microglia are mainly scavenger cells but also perform various other functions in tissue repair and neural regeneration. they form a network of immune alert resident macrophages with a capacity for immune surveillance and control. activated microglia can destroy invading micro-organisms, remove potentially deleterious debris, promote tissue repair by secreting growth factors and thus facilitate the return to tissue homeostasis. an understanding of intercellular signalling pathways for microglia proliferation and activation could form a rational basis for targeted intervention on glial reactions to injuries in the cns.
@background an empirical study of learning from imbalanced data we present a comprehensive suite of experimentation on the subject of learning from imbalanced data. when classes are imbalanced, many learning algorithms can suffer from the perspective of reduced performance. can data sampling be used to improve the performance of learners built from imbalanced data? is the effectiveness of sampling related to the type of learner? do the results change if the objective is to optimize different performance metrics? we address these and other issues in this work, showing that sampling in many cases will improve classifier performance.
@background proline‐rich acidic protein 1 (prap1) is a novel interacting partner of mad1 and has a suppressive role in mitotic checkpoint signalling in hepatocellular carcinoma motivation genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. we conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.   results to obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mrna expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15< tau<0.85 were found to constitute >50% of all expression patterns. we developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the i(b) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-i(b) tissues in which it shows low expression. the 85 dominant midrange patterns with i(b)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. these findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.   availability all data and analyses are publically available at the genenote website, http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/genenote/ and, geo accession gse803.   contact doron.lancet@weizmann.ac.il   supplementary information four tables available at the above site.

@background arbuscular mycorrhizal infection in two morphological root types of araucaria araucana (molina) k. koch. summaryroots of 76 plant species collected in west spitsbergen (svalbard), in the middle-northern arctic zone, were examined for mycorrhiza and root-associated fungi. dryas octopetala, pedicularis dasyantha and salix polaris were ectomycorrhizal and cassiope tetragona and empetrum hermaphroditum ericoid mycorrhizal. pedicularis dasyantha was only slightly infected. structures resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (vam) fungi were not found in the roots, and soil samples screened for vam fungi contained only one spore. root endophytic fungi commonly occurred in spits-bergen, but only olpidium brassicae, pleospora herbarum, papulaspora, microdochium bolleyi and rhizoctonia solani were identified with reasonable certainty. a sterile endophytic dark-septate fungus (dsf) was in 39.5% of the flowering-plant species examined, especially in the brassicaceae, caryophyllaceae, saxifragaceae and poaceae. dsf were categorized into four slightly overlapping groups. sterile endophytic hyaline septate fungi were rare. in the literature it is suggested that at least some of the dsf species or the hyaline septate fungi are functionally mutualistic rather than saprophytic or pathogenic. the literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi and plants in spitsbergen is reviewed, including about 50 species, mainly of the genera cortinarius, hebeloma, inocybe, laccaria, lactarius and russula. these are symbiotic with the above-mentioned ectomycorrhizal plants. four further ectomycorrhizal plants (betula nana, salix spp.) are very rare in the area.
@method comparison of four modeling tools for the prediction of potential distribution for non-indigenous weeds in the united states the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis (cfsr) was completed for the 31-yr period from 1979 to 2009, in january 2010. the cfsr was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. the current cfsr will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. new features of the cfsr include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the gridpoint statistical interpolation (gsi) scheme over the entire period. the cfsr global atmosphere resolution is ~38 km (t382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hpa. the global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m. the global land surface model has four soil levels and the global sea ice m...
@method a restful interface to annotations on the web rdf, the core data format for the semantic web, is increasingly being deployed both from automated sources and via human authoring either directly or through tools that generate rdf output. as individuals build up large amounts of rdf data and as groups begin to collaborate on authoring knowledge stores in rdf, the need for some kind of version management becomes apparent. while there are many version control systems available for program source code and even for xml data, the use of version control for rdf data is not a widely explored area. this paper examines an existing version control system for program source code, darcs, which is grounded in a semi-formal theory of patches, and proposes an adaptation to directly manage versions of an rdf triple store.
@method associations between enterotoxin gene cluster types egc1, egc2 and egc3, agr types, enterotoxin and enterotoxin-like gene profiles, and molecular typing characteristics of human nasal carriage and animal isolates of staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus aureus isolates from cows in ireland (n = 102) and the usa (n = 42) were characterized by rapd‐pcr and analysed for the production of a number of putative virulence factors. of these strains 63 representative isolates were screened for the corresponding virulence factor genes by pcr or southern hybridization or both. the isolates were divided into 12 distinct clonal types on the basis of their rapd fingerprint profiles. of the isolates, 107 (74·3%) tested positive for clumping factor in a slide agglutination test, all 24 rapd type 7 isolates being negative for clumping factor. pcr analysis of region r, a repeat region of the clfa gene, revealed eight region‐r sizes. there was a strong association between rapd type and the clfa region‐r genotype among irish isolates. of the rapd type 7 isolates, 21 (87·5%) coproduced toxic shock syndrome toxin‐1 (tsst‐1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec). over 90% of isolates demonstrated haemolytic activity on sheep or rabbit red blood cells and all isolates harboured the gamma‐haemolysin (hlg) locus. of the irish isolates, all those of rapd type 7 were sensitive to penicillin g, whereas 86% of rapd types 4 and 5 strains were resistant. furthermore, rapd types 5 and 7 were more likely to be associated with clinical mastitis whereas rapd type 4 isolates were more often associated with a latent infection. the current study identifies some of the putative virulence factors produced by the predominant clonal types of bovine staph. aureus that may be considered as components of a vaccine.
@background budding yeast cdc6p induces re-replication in fission yeast by inhibition of scfpop-mediated proteolysis p25rum1 from the fission yeast s. pombe is shown to act as a specific in vitro inhibitor of the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 mitotic kinase. it is also shown that early g1 cells contain p25rum1, which associates with and inhibits the mitotic kinase, and maintains p56cdc13 mitotic b cyclin at a low level, ensuring that these cells do not undergo a premature lethal entry into mitosis. a high level of p25rum1 in g2 cells inhibits the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 kinase that removes the block preventing a further s phase and leads to repeated rounds of dna replication. thus, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p25rum1, acting on the p34cdc2 mitotic kinase, plays an important role in ensuring the correct sequence of s phase and mitosis during the cell cycle.
@background weekly screening supports terminating nosocomial transmissions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci on an oncologic ward – a retrospective analysis abstract infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. prompt identification of colonized patients combined with effective multifaceted infection control practices can reduce the transmission of vre and aid in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (hais). increasingly, the clinical microbiology laboratory is being asked to support infection control efforts through the early identification of potential patient or environmental reservoirs. this review discusses the factors that contribute to the rise of vre as an important health care-associated pathogen, the utility of laboratory screening and various infection control strategies, and the available laboratory methods to identify vre in clinical specimens.
@background predictors of health worker performance after integrated management of childhood illness training in benin: a cohort study objectives to prepare for the implementation of integrated management of childhood illness (imci) in benin, we studied the management of ill children younger than 5 years at outpatient health facilities.   methods we observed a representative sample of consultations; after each consultation, we interviewed caregivers and reexamined children. health workers' performance was evaluated against imci guidelines. to identify determinants of performance, statistical modeling was performed and 6 focus groups with health workers were conducted to solicit their opinions.   results altogether, 584 children were enrolled and 101 health workers were observed; 130 health workers participated in focus group discussions. many serious deficiencies were found: incomplete assessment of children's signs and symptoms, incorrect diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening illnesses, inappropriate prescription of dangerous sedatives, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and failure to refer severely ill children for hospitalization. quantitative and qualitative analyses showed various health facility-, health worker-, caregiver-, and child-related factors as possible determinants of health worker performance.   conclusions action is urgently needed. our results suggest that to improve health care delivery, interventions should target both the health system and the community level.
@method experimental demonstration of non-binary ldpc coded modulation for ultra-long-haul transmission systems we propose a maximum a posteriori probability (map) turbo equalizer based on the sliding-window multilevel bahl-cocke-jelinek-raviv algorithm. this scheme is suitable for simultaneous nonlinear and linear impairment mitigation in multilevel coded-modulation schemes with coherent detection. the proposed scheme employs large-girth quasicyclic ldpc codes as channel codes. we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with fiber nonlinearities by performing monte carlo simulations. in addition, we provide the experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with polarization mode dispersion. we also study the ultimate channel capacity limits, assuming an independent identically distributed source.
@method variability of erythrocyte and serum lithium levels correlates with therapist treatment adherence efforts and maintenance treatment outcome background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.

@background effect of exogenous lysine on the expression of early cephamycin c biosynthetic genes and antibiotic production in nocardia lactamdurans ma4213 abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
@background is there diurnal variation of the vestibulosympathetic reflex: implications for orthostatic hypotension. melatonin has been reported to decrease nerve activity of medial vestibular nuclei in the rat and is associated with attenuated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) responses to baroreceptor unloading in humans. the purpose of this study was to determine if melatonin alters the vestibulosympathetic reflex (vsr) and vestibulocollic reflex (vcr) in humans. in study 1, msna, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in 12 healthy subjects (28 ± 1 yr; 6 men, 6 women) during head-down rotation (hdr) before and 45 min after ingestion of either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo (sucrose). subjects returned at least 2 days later at the same time of day to repeat the trial after ingesting the opposite treatment (melatonin or placebo). melatonin significantly attenuated msna responses during hdr compared with placebo (burst frequency δ 4 ± 1 vs. δ 7 ± 1 bursts/min, and total msna δ 51 ± 20 and δ 96 ± 15%, respectively; p < 0.02). in study 2, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (vemp) were measured in 10 healthy subjects (26 ± 1 yr; 4 men and 6 women) before and after ingestion of 3 mg melatonin. melatonin did not alter the timing of the p13 and n23 peaks (pre-melatonin 13.2 ± 0.4 and 21.3 ± 0.6 ms vs. post-melatonin 13.5 ± 0.4 and 21.4 ± 0.7 ms, respectively) or the p13-n23 interpeak amplitudes [pre-melatonin 22.5 ± 4.6 arbitrary units (au) and post-melatonin 22.7 ± 4.6 au]. in summary, melatonin attenuates the vsr and supports the concept that melatonin negatively affects orthostatic tolerance. however, melatonin does not alter the vcr in humans suggesting melatonin's effect on the vsr appears to be mediated by the utricles.
@method a digital library effort to support the building of grammatical resources for italian dialects this paper examines the current way of keeping the data produced during the evaluation campaigns and highlights some shortenings of it. as a consequence, we propose a new approach for improving the management evaluation campaigns' data. in this approach, the data are considered as scientific data to be cured and enriched in order to give full support to longitudinal statistical studies and long-term preservation.
@background degree of conversion of nano-hybrid resin-based composites with novel and conventional matrix formulation objective the objective of this study was to compare the microstructures of teeth, natural opals, and opal dental enamel porcelains to examine the mechanisms that cause opalescence.   method and materials four dental porcelains, a natural opal mineral, and a human tooth were examined. replicas were assessed in transmission electron microscopy for features that would cause opalescence. enamel dental porcelains denoted as "light" were selected for the study. x-ray diffraction and color analyses of the porcelains were also performed.   results all the materials were opalescent, to varying degrees. the porcelains with fewer microscopic features were less opalescent. the presence of dispersed particles or a phase-separated glass was found to cause opalescence in dental porcelains.   conclusion a phase-separated glass in one enamel porcelain best resembled the microstructure of natural opal mineral and teeth, and this was the most "opalescent" material.
@background endospore surface properties of commonly used bacillus anthracis surrogates vary in aqueous solution this study was designed to elucidate the influence of spore properties such as the presence of an exosporium, on their ability to adhere to materials. this analysis was performed on 17 strains belonging to the b. cereus group and to less related bacillus species. we first demonstrated that spores of the b. cereus group, surrounded by an exosporium, differed in their morphological features such as exosporium size, number of appendages or hair-like nap length. we also found that the saccharidic composition of exosporium differed among strains, e.g. concerning a newly identified rhamnose derivative: the 2,4-o-dimethyl-rhamnose. conversely, spores of distant bacillus species shared morphological and physico-chemical properties with b. cereus spores. some external features were also observed on these spores, such as a thin loose-fitting layer, whose nature is still to be determined, or a thick saccharidic layer (mainly composed of rhamnose and quinovose). the ability of spores to adhere to stainless steel varied among strains, those belonging to the b. cereus group generally being the most adherent. however, the presence of an exosporium is not sufficient to explain the ability of spores to adhere to inanimate surfaces. indeed, when the 17 strains were compared, hydrophobicity and the number of appendages were the only significant adhesion parameters. furthermore, the differences in spore adhesion observed within the b. cereus group were related to differences in the number of appendages, the exosporium length and to a lesser extent, the zeta potential.
@method compact aspect embedding for diversified query expansions diversified query expansion aims to cover different possible intents of a short and ambiguous query. most standard approaches use a single source of information, e.g., the initial retrieval list or some external resource like conceptnet. the coverage is thus limited by that of the resource. to alleviate this issue, we propose the use of multiple resources. more specifically, our framework first automatically generates a list of diversified queries for each resource, and then combines the retrieved documents for all the expanded queries following the maximal marginal relevance principal. we evaluate our framework on several trec data sets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of incorporating different resources for diversified query expansion.
@method vitamin a transporting proteins in human epidermis and blister fluids in fetal life the development of bullous pemphigoid antigen is preceded by a morphologically detectable basement membrane zone (bmz). the present study investigated the possibility that similar morphologic and antigenic changes of the bmz occur in short term organ culture of human skin. twenty small pieces from each of four neonatal foreskin specimens were cultured under standard conditions. at regular intervals two pieces from each specimen were removed. one piece was frozen and cryostat sections were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a patient's serum that was proven to have circulating pemphigoid igg antibodies. additional sections were stained with periodic acid-schiff and hematoxylin and eosin. the other piece was processed for electron microscopic examination. morphologically the bmz started degenerating after 24 hours. regeneration started on the 4th day and reached an optimal level on the 5th day. chance of the immunofluorescence line at the bmz began with a slight weakening at 24 hours followed by progressive widening and breakage until the 4th day when fluorescence was no longer detectable. except for a few punctate areas immunofluorescence remained absent on the 5th day. sixth day specimens, however, revealed reappearance of the immunofluorescence line in a continuous pattern. by the 7th day a second morphologic and antigenic degeneration started at the bmz. this lag between the morphologic and antigenic regeneration of the bmz in organ culture although shorter is comparable to the one observed during the development of the bmz in fetal life.
@result granger causality analysis of steady-state electroencephalographic signals during propofol-induced anaesthesia study objectives the electrophysiological correlates of anesthetic sedation remain poorly understood. we used high-density electroencephalography (hd-eeg) and source modeling to investigate the cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep.   design 256-channel eeg recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia.   setting hospital operating room.   patients or participants 8 healthy subjects (4 males).   interventions n/a.   measurements and results initially, propofol induced increases in eeg power from 12-25 hz. loss of consciousness (loc) was accompanied by the appearance of eeg slow waves that resembled the slow waves of nrem sleep. we compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. however, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 hz) power that persisted throughout loc. source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. during loc, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness.   conclusions propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.
@background nitric oxide and cyclic gmp induce vesicle release at drosophila neuromuscular junction. nitric oxide is generated by a ca2+/calmodulin‐stimulated nitric oxide synthase and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase. using nadph diaphorase (nadphd) staining as a marker for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and an antiserum against cgmp, we investigated the cellular organization of nitric oxide donor and target cells in olfactory pathways of the brain of the locust (schistocerca gregaria). a small subset of neuronal and glial cells expressed cgmp immunoreactivity after incubation of tissue in a nitric oxide donor. nitric oxide‐induced increases in cgmp immunoreactivity were quantified in a tissue preparation of the antennal lobe and in primary mushroom body cell cultures. the mushroom body neuropil is a potential target of a transcellular nitric oxide/ cgmp messenger system since it is innervated by extrinsic nadphd‐positive neurons. the mushroom body‐intrinsic kenyon cells do not stain for nadphd but can be induced to express cgmp immunoreactivity. the colocalization of nadphd and cgmp immunoreactivity in a cluster of interneurons of the antennal lobe, the principal olfactory neuropil of the insect brain, suggests a role of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in olfactory sensory processing. colocalization of nadphd staining and cgmp immunoreactivity was also found in certain glial cells. the cellular organization of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in neurons and glia raises the possibility that nitric oxide acts not only as an intercellular but also as an intracellular messenger molecule in the insect brain.
@background visual tracking using an insect vision embedded particle filter recent years have seen greater interest in the use of discriminative classifiers in tracking systems, owing to their success in object detection. they are trained online with samples collected during tracking. unfortunately, the potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden, which directly conflicts with real-time requirements. on the other hand, limiting the samples may sacrifice performance.    interestingly, we observed that, as we add more and more samples, the problem acquires circulant structure. using the well-established theory of circulant matrices, we provide a link to fourier analysis that opens up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the fast fourier transform. this can be done in the dual space of kernel machines as fast as with linear classifiers. we derive closed-form solutions for training and detection with several types of kernels, including the popular gaussian and polynomial kernels. the resulting tracker achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art, can be implemented with only a few lines of code and runs at hundreds of frames-per-second. matlab code is provided in the paper (see algorithm 1).
@background running head : guessing in change detection 1 informed guessing in change detection here we examine a new task to assess working memory for visual arrays in which the participant must judge how many items changed from a studied array to a test array. as a clue to processing, on some trials in the first 2 experiments, participants carried out a metamemory judgment in which they were to decide how many items were in working memory. trial-to-trial fluctuations in these working memory storage judgments correlated with performance fluctuations within an individual, indicating a need to include trial-to-trial variation within capacity models (through either capacity fluctuation or some other attention parameter). mathematical modeling of the results achieved a good fit to a complex pattern of results, suggesting that working memory capacity limits can apply even to judgments that involve an entire array rather than just a single item that may have changed, thus providing the expected conscious access to at least some of the contents of working memory.
@method a hybrid feature model for seam carving detection presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. the method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform," are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. we derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. the proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.
@background supporting aspartate biosynthesis is an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an emerging hallmark of neoplastic transformation. however, it is not known how the expression of metabolic genes in tumors differs from that in normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit similar metabolic changes. here we compare expression patterns of metabolic genes across 22 diverse types of human tumors. overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. although expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) are very heterogeneous. our analysis also suggests that the expression changes of some metabolic genes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) may enhance or mimic the effects of recurrent mutations in tumors. on the level of individual biochemical reactions, many hundreds of metabolic isoenzymes show significant and tumor-specific expression changes. these isoenzymes are potential targets for anticancer therapy.
@background social experience in 10-year-old children born with a cleft: exploring psychosocial resilience the objective of this study was to determine whether variation in psychological adjustment to physically disfiguring conditions is related to organisation of the content of appearance-related information in the self-concept. a cross-sectional design was employed, using 70 participants with a range of appearance problems recruited from support groups and the nhs. a postal paper and pencil task was completed by participants which assessed the level of their adjustment using the derriford appearance scale, and measured the three self-concept variables – differential importance, compartmentalisation and complexity. regression analyses showed that poor adjustment to disfigurement is related to greater differential importance of appearance-related self-aspects, greater compartmentalisation of appearance-related information and greater self-concept complexity. no moderating effects were found between these independent variables. the results have implications for psychological treatment strategies, particularly cognitive behavioural therapeutic interventions.
@background evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
@background the role of macrophages in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways of alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis: pathogenetic cellular effectors and potential therapeutic targets pu.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. mice homozygous for a disruption in the pu.1 dna binding domain are born alive but die of severe septicemia within 48 h. the analysis of these neonates revealed a lack of mature macrophages, neutrophils, b cells and t cells, although erythrocytes and megakaryocytes were present. the absence of lymphoid commitment and development in null mice was not absolute, since mice maintained on antibiotics began to develop normal appearing t cells 3–5 days after birth. in contrast, mature b cells remained undetectable in these older mice. within the myeloid lineage, despite a lack of macrophages in the older antibiotic‐treated animals, a few cells with the characteristics of neutrophils began to appear by day 3. while the pu.1 protein appears not to be essential for myeloid and lymphoid lineage commitment, it is absolutely required for the normal differentiation of b cells and macrophages.
@result comparison of local infiltration analgesia with femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized clinical trial. background we report a prospective blinded randomised trial of local infiltration versus femoral nerve block in patients undergoing primary total knee replacement (tkr), in accordance with the consort statement 2010.   methods fifty patients in a teaching hospital were consented for the study. the study arms were intraoperative local anaesthesia (150ml 0.2% ropivacaine/1ml 1:1000 adrenaline/30mg ketolorac) and femoral nerve block (30ml 0.2% ropivacaine) with a primary outcome of pain score at 4h post operatively. secondary outcomes were pain at 2h, pain scores before and after physiotherapy on day one, total opiate administered, time to physiotherapy goals and length of stay. randomisation was by sealed envelope. the assessor was blinded and the patients partially blinded to the intervention.   results ten patients were excluded, eight before randomisation. the trial is complete. forty patients were analysed for the primary outcome measure. the local infiltration group had significantly lower pain scores at 4h post-operatively; mean [sd] score 2.1 [2.6] versus 6.8 [3.2], p<0.00001 and on post-operative day one prior to physiotherapy; mean score 2.4 [2.3] versus 4.4 [2.3], p<0.05. total opiate use was also significantly lower in the local infiltration group; mean total 115 [50.3]mg versus 176.5 [103.5]mg, p<0.01. there was no difference in any other outcome. there were no harms as a result of either intervention.   conclusion intraoperative local infiltration gives superior pain relief compared to single shot femoral nerve block over the first 24h following primary tkr and minimises post-operative opiate use.
@background review of bortezomib treatment of antibody-mediated rejection in renal transplantation. plasma cells provide humoral immunity. they have traditionally been viewed mainly as short-lived end-stage products of b-cell differentiation that deserve little interest. this view is changing, however, because we now know that plasma cells can survive for long periods in the appropriate survival niches and that they are an independent cellular component of immunological memory. studies of the biology of plasma cells reveal a mechanism of intriguing simplicity and elegance that focuses memory provided by plasma cells on recently encountered pathogens while minimizing the 'fading' of memory for pathogens encountered in the distant past. this mechanism is based on competition for survival niches between newly generated plasmablasts and older plasma cells.
@result changes in pulmonary function and influencing factors after high-dose intrathoracic radio(chemo)therapy purpose to evaluate the long-term impact of locoregional breast radiotherapy (rt) on pulmonary function tests (pfts).   methods and materials this study included 75 women who underwent postoperative locoregional breast rt. pfts were performed before rt and 3, 6, and 12 months and 8 to 10 years after rt. by use of univariate and multivariate analyses, the impact of treatment- and patient-related factors on late changes in pfts was evaluated.   results during the first year after rt, all pfts significantly worsened at 3 to 6 months after rt (p < 0.05). at 12 months, forced vital capacity (fvc), vital capacity (vc), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev(1)) recovered almost to baseline values, whereas total lung capacity (tlc) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (dl(co)) recovered only slightly and were still found to be decreased compared with baseline (p < 0.05). at 8 to 10 years after rt, mean reductions in fev(1) of 4% (p = 0.03) and in vc, dl(co), and tlc of 5%, 9%, and 11% (all p < 0.0001), respectively, were observed compared with pre-rt values. on multivariate analysis, tamoxifen use negatively affected tlc at 8 to 10 years after rt (p = 0.033), whereas right-sided irradiation was associated with a late reduction in fev(1) (p = 0.027). for fev(1) and dl(co), an early decrease was predictive for a late decrease (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0009, respectively).   conclusions the time course of pft changes after locoregional rt for breast cancer follows a biphasic pattern. an early reduction in pfts at 3 to 6 months with a partial recovery at 12 months after rt is followed by a late, more important pft reduction up to 8 to 10 years after rt. tamoxifen use may have an impact on this late decline in pfts.
@method clinical and virological features of dengue in vietnamese infants the pathogenesis of dengue in infants is poorly understood. we postulated that dengue severity in infants would be positively associated with markers of viral burden and that maternally derived, neutralizing anti-dengue antibody would have decayed before the age at which infants with dengue presented to the hospital. in 75 vietnamese infants with primary dengue, we found significant heterogeneity in viremia and ns1 antigenemia at hospital presentation, and these factors were independent of disease grade or continuous measures of disease severity. neutralizing antibody titers, predicted in each infant at the time of their illness, suggested that the majority of infants (65%) experienced dengue hemorrhagic fever when the maternally derived neutralizing antibody titer had declined to <1 : 20. collectively, these data have important implications for dengue vaccine research because they suggest that viral burden may not solely explain severe dengue in infants and that neutralizing antibody is a reasonable but not absolute marker of protective immunity in infants.
@method manifold identification of dual averaging methods for regularized stochastic online learning convex programming involves a convex set f ⊆ rn and a convex cost function c : f → r. the goal of convex programming is to find a point in f which minimizes c. in online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in f before seeing the cost function for that step. this can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. we introduce an algorithm for this domain. we also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (giga) is universally consistent.
@method creb binding protein (cbp) activation is required for luteinizing hormone beta expression and normal fertility in mice hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential for maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations and is regulated by opposing stimulatory (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, camp) and inhibitory (insulin) signaling pathways. the camp signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation of camp response element–binding (creb) protein, resulting in recruitment of the coactivators creb-binding protein (cbp) and p300 and subsequent activation of gluconeogenesis. insulin signaling leads to phosphorylation of cbp at serine 436, a residue near its creb-interacting domain, but it is unknown whether this event modulates camp signaling. here, we show in vitro and in 'knock-in' mice that a mutant cbp (s436a) is aberrantly recruited to creb protein, resulting in inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis in the fed state and glucose intolerance resulting from increased hepatic glucose production. we propose that insulin signaling may directly regulate many camp signaling pathways at the transcriptional level by controlling cbp recruitment.
@method sex of experimenter and social norm effects on reports of sexual behavior in young men and women individual differences in willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations were investigated in 6 studies. in study 1, a 5-item sociosexual orientation inventory (soi) was developed. studies 2, 3, and 4 provided convergent validity evidence for the soi, revealing that persons who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation tend to (a) engage in sex at an earlier point in their relationships, (b) engage in sex with more than 1 partner at a time, and (c) be involved in relationships characterized by less investment, commitment, love, and dependency. study 5 provided discriminant validity for the soi, revealing that it does not covary appreciably with a good marker of sex drive. study 6 demonstrated that the soi correlates negligibly with measures of sexual satisfaction, anxiety, and guilt. the possible stability of, origins of, and motivational bases underlying individual differences in sociosexuality are discussed.
@background active contextual entropy search contextual policy search is a reinforcement learning approach for multi-task learning in the context of robot control learning. it can be used to learn versatilely applicable skills that generalize over a range of tasks specified by a context vector. in this work, we combine contextual policy search with ideas from active learning for selecting the task in which the next trial will be performed. moreover, we use active training set selection for reducing detrimental effects of exploration in the sampling policy. a core challenge in this approach is that the distribution of the obtained rewards may not be directly comparable between different tasks. we propose the novel approach pubsve for estimating a reward baseline and investigate empirically on benchmark problems and simulated robotic tasks to which extent this method can remedy the issue of non-comparable reward.
@background gaussian multiple-access relay channels with non-causal side information at the transmitters we extend shannon's result on the capacity of channels with state information to multiple user channels. more specifically, we characterize the capacity (region) of degraded broadcast channels and physically degraded relay channels where the channel state information is causally available at the transmitters. we also obtain inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for multiple access channels with causal state information at the transmitters
@background relationship between circulating syndecan-1 levels (cd138s) and serum free light chains in monoclonal gammopathies significance exosome-mediated intercellular transfer of proteins and nucleic acids has attracted considerable attention as exosomes may promote the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of exosome uptake by target cells and how this may be inhibited remain as important questions. we provide evidence that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) function as receptors of cancer cell-derived exosomes. importantly, our data indicate that the hspg-dependent uptake route is highly relevant for the biological activity of exosomes, and thus a potential target for inhibition of exosome-mediated tumor development. given that several viruses have previously been shown to enter cells through hspgs, our data implicate hspg as a convergence point during cellular uptake of endogenous vesicles and virus particles. extracellular vesicle (ev)-mediated intercellular transfer of signaling proteins and nucleic acids has recently been implicated in the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of ev uptake and how this may be targeted remain as important questions. here, we provide evidence that heparan sulfate (hs) proteoglycans (pgs; hspgs) function as internalizing receptors of cancer cell-derived evs with exosome-like characteristics. internalized exosomes colocalized with cell-surface hspgs of the syndecan and glypican type, and exosome uptake was specifically inhibited by free hs chains, whereas closely related chondroitin sulfate had no effect. by using several cell mutants, we provide genetic evidence of a receptor function of hspg in exosome uptake, which was dependent on intact hs, specifically on the 2-o and n-sulfation groups. further, enzymatic depletion of cell-surface hspg or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous pg biosynthesis by xyloside significantly attenuated exosome uptake. we provide biochemical evidence that hspgs are sorted to and associate with exosomes; however, exosome-associated hspgs appear to have no direct role in exosome internalization. on a functional level, exosome-induced erk1/2 signaling activation was attenuated in pg-deficient mutant cells as well as in wt cells treated with xyloside. importantly, exosome-mediated stimulation of cancer cell migration was significantly reduced in pg-deficient mutant cells, or by treatment of wt cells with heparin or xyloside. we conclude that cancer cell-derived exosomes use hspgs for their internalization and functional activity, which significantly extends the emerging role of hspgs as key receptors of macromolecular cargo.
@method clinical potentials of methylator phenotype in stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma: an open challenge purpose because current approaches to risk classification and treatment stratification for children with neuroblastoma (nb) vary greatly throughout the world, it is difficult to directly compare risk-based clinical trials. the international neuroblastoma risk group (inrg) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification.   patients and methods the statistical and clinical significance of 13 potential prognostic factors were analyzed in a cohort of 8,800 children diagnosed with nb between 1990 and 2002 from north america and australia (children's oncology group), europe (international society of pediatric oncology europe neuroblastoma group and german pediatric oncology and hematology group), and japan. survival tree regression analyses using event-free survival (efs) as the primary end point were performed to test the prognostic significance of the 13 factors.   results stage, age, histologic category, grade of tumor differentiation, the status of the mycn oncogene, chromosome 11q status, and dna ploidy were the most highly statistically significant and clinically relevant factors. a new staging system (inrg staging system) based on clinical criteria and tumor imaging was developed for the inrg classification system. the optimal age cutoff was determined to be between 15 and 19 months, and 18 months was selected for the classification system. sixteen pretreatment groups were defined on the basis of clinical criteria and statistically significantly different efs of the cohort stratified by the inrg criteria. patients with 5-year efs more than 85%, more than 75% to < or = 85%, > or = 50% to < or = 75%, or less than 50% were classified as very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk, respectively.   conclusion by defining homogenous pretreatment patient cohorts, the inrg classification system will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world and the development of international collaborative studies.
@background influence of zearalenone on selected biochemical parameters in juvenile rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). bisphenol a (bpa), an estrogenic environmental contaminant is also known for oxidative stress-inducing effect. malnutrition is recognized as a confounding factor in oxidative stress. however, little is known about effect of malnutrition on oxidative stress induced by bpa or other endocrine disrupting chemicals (edcs). we studied effect of malnutrition (iron deficiency) in rats chronically exposed to low levels of bpa taking into consideration the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in liver, kidney and gonads. iron deficiency significantly elevated level of lipid peroxidation in bpa-exposed rats. similarly, decrease in reduced glutathione level was more significant in rats maintained on iron deficient diet compared to those maintained on normal diet. iron deficiency also significantly modulated activities of vital antioxidant enzymes in all the tissues. female rats showed more vulnerability than males to iron-deficiency modulated effects of bpa on the above parameters. this study demonstrated that malnutrition, especially iron deficiency, might act as a confounding factor in edc-induced oxidative stress. however, more studies may be needed to confirm effect of nutritional factors on estrogenic activity of bpa or other edcs.
@background analysis of hoxd-13 and hoxd-11 misexpression in chick limb buds reveals that hox genes affect both bone condensation and growth. replication-competent avian retroviruses, capable of transducing and expressing up to 2 kb of nonviral sequences, are now available to effect widespread gene transfer in chicken (chick) embryos (s. h. hughes, j. j. greenhouse, c. j. petropoulos, and p. sutrave, j. virol. 61:3004-3012, 1987). we have constructed novel avian retroviral vectors that encode human placental alkaline phosphatase as a marker whose expression can be histochemically monitored. these vectors have been tested for expression by introducing them into the embryonic chick nervous system. they have revealed that the expression of retrovirally transduced genes can be spatially and temporally limited without the need for tissue-specific promoters. by varying the site and time of infection, targeted gene transfer can be confined to selected populations of neural cells over the course of several days, a time window that is sufficient for many key developmental processes. the capability of differentially infecting specific target populations may avoid confounding variables such as detrimental effects of a transduced gene on processes unrelated to the cells or tissue of interest. these vectors and methods thus should be useful in studies of the effect of transduced genes on the development of various organs and tissues during avian embryogenesis. in addition, the vectors will facilitate studies aimed at an understanding of viral infection and expression patterns.
@background environmental pcb exposure and risk of endometriosis. 17 beta-estradiol (e2) induces cathepsin d mrna levels and intracellular levels of immunoreactive protein in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) alone does not affect cathepsin d gene expression in this cell line; however, in cells cotreated with tcdd and e2, tcdd inhibited e2-induced cathepsin d mrna levels, the rate of gene transcription, and levels of immunoreactive protein. the inhibitory responses were observed within 30 to 120 min after the cells were treated with tcdd. tcdd also inhibited e2-induced secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in aryl hydrocarbon (ah)-responsive mcf-7 and wild-type mouse hepa 1c1c7 cells cotransfected with the human estrogen receptor (her) and the pbc12/s1/pac plasmid, which contains the 5' promoter region (-296/+57) of the cathepsin d gene and an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. the e2-responsive er/sp1 sequence (-199 to -165) in the cathepsin d 5' region contains an imperfect gtgcgtg (-175/-181) xenobiotic responsive element (xre); the role of this sequence in ah responsiveness was investigated in gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays and with plasmid constructs containing a wild-type er/sp1 oligonucleotide or a mutant er/sp1-"xre" oligonucleotide containing two c-->a mutations in the xre sequence (antisense strand). in plasmid constructs which contained a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and the wild-type er/sp1 promoter sequence, e2-induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and mrna levels were inhibited by tcdd whereas no inhibition was observed with the mutant er/sp1-"xre" plasmids. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the nuclear or transformed cytosolic ah receptor complex blocked formation of the er-sp1 complex with the wild-type but not the er/sp1 mutant oligonucleotide. moreover, incubation of the wild-type bromodeoxyuridine-substituted er/sp1 oligonucleotide with the nuclear ah receptor complex gave a specifically bound cross-linked 200-kda band. these data demonstrate that ah receptor-mediated inhibition of e2-induced cathepsin d gene expression is due to disruption of the er-sp1 complex by targeted interaction with an overlapping xre.
@method determination of fetal malnutrition in preterm newborns fetal malnutrition is a common and potentially serious problem perinatally and for later growth and development. unless sought in the neonate, fetal malnutrition is frequently missed but can be detected readily by a simple clinical examination.
@method suppression of arabidopsis argonaute 1-mediated slicing , transgene-induced rna silencing , and dna methylation by distinct domains of the cucumber mosaic virus 2 b protein the agrobacterium vacuum infiltration method has made it possible to transform arabidopsis thaliana without plant tissue culture or regeneration. in the present study, this method was evaluated and a substantially modified transformation method was developed. the labor-intensive vacuum infiltration process was eliminated in favor of simple dipping of developing floral tissues into a solution containing agrobacterium tumefaciens, 5% sucrose and 500 microliters per litre of surfactant silwet l-77. sucrose and surfactant were critical to the success of the floral dip method. plants inoculated when numerous immature floral buds and few siliques were present produced transformed progeny at the highest rate. plant tissue culture media, the hormone benzylamino purine and ph adjustment were unnecessary, and agrobacterium could be applied to plants at a range of cell densities. repeated application of agrobacterium improved transformation rates and overall yield of transformants approximately twofold. covering plants for 1 day to retain humidity after inoculation also raised transformation rates twofold. multiple ecotypes were transformable by this method. the modified method should facilitate high-throughput transformation of arabidopsis for efforts such as t-dna gene tagging, positional cloning, or attempts at targeted gene replacement.
@result production and characterization of rhamnolipid biosurfactant from waste frying coconut oil using a novel pseudomonas aeruginosa d the fermentative production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant from pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2297 was carried out by submerged fermentation using various cost-effective waste materials such as orange peelings, carrot peel waste, lime peelings, coconut oil cake, and banana waste. the orange peel was found to be the best substrate generating 9.18 g/l of rhamnolipid biosurfactant with a surface tension reduction up to 31.3 mn/m. the production was growth independent, and optimum conditions were standardized. the emulsifying activity was highest against kerosene (73.3%). rhamnolipid components were purified and separated by ethyl acetate extraction, preparative silica gel column chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. the major rhamnolipid components were characterized, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, as a mixture of dirhamnolipids and monorhamnolipids.
@method self-compassion and risk behavior among people living with hiv/aids. purpose human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) treatment self-efficacy is the confidence held by an individual in her or his ability to follow treatment recommendations, including specific hiv care such as initiating and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (art). the purpose of this study was to explore the potential mediating role of treatment adherence self-efficacy in the relationships between social cognitive theory constructs and self- reported art adherence.   design cross-sectional and descriptive. the study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 and included 1,414 participants who lived in the united states or puerto rico and were taking antiretroviral medications.   methods social cognitive constructs were tested specifically: behaviors (three adherence measures each consisting of one item about adherence at 3-day and 30-day along with the adherence rating scale), cognitive or personal factors (the center for epidemiology studies depression scale to assess for depressive symptoms, the 12-item short form health survey (sf-12) to assess physical functioning, one item about physical condition, one item about comorbidity), environmental influences (the social capital scale, one item about social support), and treatment self-efficacy (hiv adherence self-efficacy scale). analysis included descriptive statistics and regression.   results the average participant was 47 years old, male, and a racial or ethnic minority, had an education of high school or less, had barely adequate or totally inadequate income, did not work, had health insurance, and was living with hiv/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome for 15 years. the model provided support for adherence self-efficacy as a robust predictor of art adherence behavior, serving a partial mediating role between environmental influences and cognitive or personal factors.   conclusions although other factors such as depressive symptoms and lack of social capital impact adherence to art, nurses can focus on increasing treatment self-efficacy through diverse interactional strategies using principles of adult learning and strategies to improve health literacy.   clinical relevance adherence to art reduces the viral load thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality and risk of transmission to uninfected persons. nurses need to use a variety of strategies to increase treatment self-efficacy.
@background synchronous contralateral adrenal metastasis of colorectal cancer: case report integrated fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (pet)-computed tomography (ct) for adrenal gland imaging in cancer patients allows early detection and accurate localization of adrenal lesions and differentiation of metastatic nodules from benign lesions, thereby facilitating treatment planning. however, false-positive findings are encountered at integrated pet-ct in approximately 5% of adrenal lesions identified as positive at pet, including adrenal adenomas, adrenal endothelial cysts, and inflammatory and infectious lesions. moreover, false-negative findings may be seen in adrenal metastatic lesions with hemorrhage or necrosis, small-sized (<10-mm) metastatic nodules, and metastases from pulmonary bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or carcinoid tumors. an awareness of the potential pitfalls of integrated pet-ct enhances the diagnostic efficacy of this modality by allowing differentiation of metastatic adrenal lesions from other abnormalities.
@background cancer-specific perk signaling drives invasion and metastasis through creb3l1 oasis is a transcription factor similar to atf6 that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. in this study we investigated the expression of oasis in human glioma cell lines and the effect of oasis knock-down on the er stress response and cell migration. oasis mrna was detected in three distinct glioma cell lines (u373, a172 and u87) and expression levels were increased upon treatment with er stress-inducing compounds in the u373 and u87 lines. oasis protein, which is glycosylated on asn-513, was detected in the u373 and u87 glioma lines at low levels in control cells and protein expression was induced by er stress. knock-down of oasis in human glioma cell lines resulted in an attenuated unfolded protein response to er stress (reduced grp78/bip and grp94 induction) and decreased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix proteins, but induction of the collagen gene col1a1 was unaffected. cells in which oasis was knocked-down exhibited altered cell morphology and reduced cell migration. these results suggest that oasis is important for the er stress response and maintenance of some extracellular matrix proteins in human glioma cells.
@result molecular and reverse genetic characterization of nucleosome assembly protein1 (nap1) genes unravels their function in transcription and nucleotide excision repair in arabidopsis thaliana. the shoot apical meristem (sam) of seed plants is the site at which lateral organs are formed. once organ primordia initiate from the sam, they establish polarity along the adaxial-abaxial, proximodistal and mediolateral axes. among these three axes, the adaxial-abaxial polarity is of primary importance in leaf patterning. in leaf development, once the adaxial-abaxial axis is established within leaf primordia, it provides cues for proper lamina growth and asymmetric development. it was reported previously that the arabidopsis asymmetric leaves1 (as1) and asymmetric leaves2 (as2) genes are two key regulators of leaf polarity. in this work, we demonstrate a new function of the as1 and as2 genes in the establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity by analyzing as1 and as2 alleles in the landsberg erecta (ler) genetic background. we provide genetic evidence that the arabidopsis erecta (er) gene is involved in the as1-as2 pathway to promote leaf adaxial fate. in addition, we show that as1 and as2 bind to each other, suggesting that as1 and as2 may form a complex that regulates the establishment of leaf polarity. we also report the effects on leaf polarity of overexpression of the as1 or as2 genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) 35s promoter. although plants with as1 and as2 mutations have very similar phenotypes, 35s::as1/ler and 35s::as2/ler transgenic plants showed dramatically different morphologies. a possible model of the as1, as2 and er action in leaf polarity formation is discussed.
@method state-dependent microstructural white matter changes in bipolar i depression most patients treated for an episode of unipolar or bipolar major depression are treatment resistant in the sense that the majority do not achieve full remission with the first somatic or psychosocial treatment they receive. little attention has been given to formalizing criteria for evaluating the nature and extent of treatment resistance, even though determining the adequacy and outcome of prior treatment trials is key in clinical decision making about subsequent treatment. furthermore, determining the adequacy of prior treatment is essential since substantial evidence indicates that large numbers of depressed patients are undertreated, resulting in prolonged episodes and the appearance of "pseudoresistance." adequacy of antidepressant treatment trials should be defined in terms of thresholds for the dosage and duration of medication, adherence, and clinical outcome. the antidepressant treatment history form is presented as one method to formalize the evaluation of treatment adequacy and treatment resistance.
@method changes in perceived attentional function in women following breast cancer surgery the primary purpose of this preliminary research was to describe the psychometric properties of a newly‐developed everyday spatial questionnaire for dementia‐patient version (esqd‐p) in a chinese population. a secondary goal was to assess the relationship between executive functions and wayfinding strategy application. the esqd‐p is a measure for the phenomenon of ‘getting lost behavior’ (glb) reported by early alzheimer's disease sufferers, based on the concept of spatial problem‐solving.
@background poly-victimization and its association with protective and vulnerability variables in adolescence: the mediating role of self-esteem youths who have been maltreated often experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and this special population has received increased attention from researchers. pathways toward maladaptive effects of maltreatment and ptsd are remarkably similar and reflect specific biological diatheses and psychological vulnerabilities that produce wide-ranging self-regulation deficits. developmental models of effects of maltreatment and of ptsd are thus increasingly intertwined and have begun to inform specialized assessment and treatment strategies for this population. this review covers key aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder in maltreated youth, including epidemiology, symptomatology, outcome, and risk factors as well as assessment and treatment strategies and challenges for these youths.
@method improving post-stroke dysphagia outcomes through a standardized and multidisciplinary protocol: an exploratory cohort study abstractaspiration is an important variable related to increased morbidity, mortality, and cost of care for acute stroke patients. this prospective systematic replication study compared a clinical swallowing examination consisting of six clinical identifiers of aspiration risk, i.e., dysphonia, dysarthria, abnormal gag reflex, abnormal volitional cough, cough after swallow, and voice change after swallow, with an instrumental fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (fees) to determine reliability in identifying aspiration risk following acute stroke. a referred consecutive sample of 49 first-time stroke patients was evaluated within 24 hours poststroke, first with the clinical examination followed immediately by fees. the endoscopist was blinded to results of clinical testing. the clinical examination correctly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk, when compared with the criterion standard fees, but incorrectly identified 3 patients as having no aspiration risk when they did. the clinical examination incorrectly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk but determined correctly no aspiration risk in 8 patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk on fees. clinical examination sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 30%; false negative rate = 14%; false positive rate = 70%; positive predictive value = 50%; and negative predictive value = 73%. it was concluded that the clinical examination, when compared with fees, underestimated aspiration risk in patients with aspiration risk and overestimated aspiration risk in patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk. careful consideration of the limitations of clinical testing leads us to believe that a reliable, timely, and cost-effective instrumental swallow evaluation should be available for the majority of patients following acute stroke.
@background hepatocyte dusp14 maintains metabolic homeostasis and suppresses inflammation in the liver dusps (dual-specificity phosphatases) are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate. dusps have been implicated as major modulators of critical signalling pathways that are dysregulated in various diseases. dusps can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, prls (phosphatases of regenerating liver), cdc14 phosphatases (cdc is cell division cycle), ptens (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, mkps (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical dusps. of these subgroups, a great deal of research has focused on the characterization of the mkps. as their name suggests, mkps dephosphorylate mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) proteins erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), jnk (c-jun n-terminal kinase) and p38 with specificity distinct from that of individual mkp proteins. atypical dusps are mostly of low-molecular-mass and lack the n-terminal ch2 (cdc25 homology 2) domain common to mkps. the discovery of most atypical dusps has occurred in the last 6 years, which has initiated a large amount of interest in their role and regulation. in the past, atypical dusps have generally been grouped together with the mkps and characterized for their role in mapk signalling cascades. indeed, some have been shown to dephosphorylate mapks. the current literature hints at the potential of the atypical dusps as important signalling regulators, but is crowded with conflicting reports. the present review provides an overview of the dusp family before focusing on atypical dusps, emerging as a group of proteins with vastly diverse substrate specificity and function.
@result different subtypes of striatal neurons are selectively modulated by cortical oscillations discharge activities and local field potentials were recorded in the orofacial motor cortex and in the corresponding rostrolateral striatum of urethane-anesthetized rats. striatal projection neurons were identified by antidromic activation and fast-spiking gabaergic interneurons (fsis) by their unique characteristics: briefer spike and burst responses. juxtacellular injection of neurobiotin combined with parvalbumin immunohistochemistry validated this identification. spontaneous activities and spike responses to cortical stimulation were recorded during both states of cortical activity: slow waves and desynchronization. both fsi and projection neurons spontaneously discharged synchronously with slow waves at the maximum of cortical activity, but, on average, fsis were much more active. cortical desynchronization enhanced fsi activity and facilitated their spike responses to cortical stimulation, whereas opposite effects were observed regarding projection neurons. experimental conditions favoring fsi discharge were always associated with a decrease in the firing activity of projection neurons. spike responses to cortical stimulation occurred earlier (latency difference, 4.6 ms) and with a lower stimulation current for fsis than for projection neurons. moreover, blocking gabaa receptors by local picrotoxin injection enhanced the spike response of projection neurons, and this increase was larger in experimental conditions favoring fsi responses. therefore, on average, fsis exert in vivo a powerful feedforward inhibition on projection neurons. however, a few projection neurons were actually more sensitive to cortical stimulation than fsis. moreover, picrotoxin, which revealed fsi inhibition, preferentially affected projection neurons exhibiting the weakest sensitivity to cortical stimulation. thus, feedforward inhibition by fsis filters cortical information effectively transmitted by striatal projection neurons.
@method longitudinal and spatial distribution of gp60 subtypes in human cryptosporidiosis cases in ireland. cryptosporidium parvum dna from 175 neonatal calves on 16 farms in eight eastern states in the united states was subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene to determinate the parasite genetic diversity. six subtypes of the iia subtype family were found. subtype iiaa15g2r1, which is the predominant c. parvum subtype in calves in many parts of the world, was identified in 77% of the c. parvum dna from calves. several farms had more than one c. parvum subtype and a few calves had infections with mixed subtypes. distribution of subtypes differed geographically. diversity of c. parvum in calves in eastern united states was lower than that previously seen in michigan and southern ontario. the high prevalence of one subtype in calves worldwide and frequent detection of this subtype in humans suggests that parasite fitness probably plays an important role in transmission of cryptosporidiosis among cattle and in zoonotic infections.
@background mental capital and wellbeing : making the most of ourselves in the 21 st century stakeholder engagement background the present study examined associations between alcohol involvement in early to middle adolescence and neuropsychological (np) functioning.   methods alcohol-dependent adolescents (n = 33) with over 100 lifetime alcohol episodes and without dependence on other substances were recruited from alcohol/drug abuse treatment facilities. comparison (n = 24) adolescents had no histories of alcohol or drug problems and were matched to alcohol-dependent participants on age (15 to 16 years), gender, socioeconomic status, education, and family history of alcohol dependence. np tests and psychosocial measures were administered to alcohol-dependent participants following 3 weeks of detoxification.   results alcohol-dependent and comparison adolescents demonstrated significant differences on several np scores. protracted alcohol use was associated with poorer performance on verbal and nonverbal retention in the context of intact learning and recognition discriminability. recent alcohol withdrawal among adolescents was associated with poor visuospatial functioning, whereas lifetime alcohol withdrawal was associated with poorer retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information.   conclusions deficits in retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information and in visuospatial functioning were evident in youths with histories of heavy drinking during early and middle adolescence.
@background parents' talk about letters with their young children. two studies were performed to determine whether children's experiences with their own names boost their knowledge about the components of the name, the letters. the children in study one showed a significant superiority for the initial letter of their own first name in tests of letter-name, but not letter-sound, knowledge. this pattern was found for australian first graders (mean age 5 years, 5 months), u.s. kindergartners (mean age 5 years, 8 months), and u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 10 months). study two, with u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 11 months), again revealed an advantage for the initial letter of a child's first name in knowledge of letter names but not knowledge of letter sounds. moreover, the children were better at printing the initial letter of their own first name than other letters. the results show that different factors are involved in the learning of letter names and letter sounds. they further suggest that children use letter-based strategies with their own names at a time when they are often considered to be "logographic" readers.
@background integrated role of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis supplementation in gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism of infant rhesus monkeys exposure to a strong t-helper 2 (th2)-like environment during fetal development may promote allergy development. increased cord blood (cb) levels of the th2-associated chemokine ccl22 were associated with allergy development during the first 2 y of life. the aim of the present study was to determine whether cb th1- and th2-associated chemokine levels are associated with allergy development during the first 6 y of life, allowing assessment of respiratory allergic symptoms usually developing in this period. the cb levels of cytokines, chemokines, and total ige were determined in 56 children of 20 women with allergic symptoms and 36 women without allergic symptoms. total ige and allergen-specific ige antibody levels were quantified at 6, 12, 24 mo, and 6 y of age. increased cb ccl22 levels were associated with development of allergic sensitization and asthma and increased ccl17 levels with development of allergic symptoms, including asthma. sensitized children with allergic symptoms showed higher cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels and higher ratios between these th2-associated chemokines and the th1-associated chemokine cxcl10 than nonsensitized children without allergic symptoms. a pronounced th2 deviation at birth, reflected by increased cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels, and increased ccl22/cxcl10 and ccl17/cxcl10 ratios might promote allergy development later in life.
@background spatial behavior: the impact of global and local geometry exploration in a dark open field undergoes three progressive changes: (i) an initial phase of spending equal amounts of time in various zones of the arena changes to staying in the corners, and ultimately spending most of the time in one corner; (ii) travel paths are first circular and scattered all over the arena, but gradually become anchored to one corner at which they start and end; (iii) traveled distance gradually decreases to that of the initial level seen in a lit open field. altogether, rodents shift from a 'looping' exploration mechanism with feeble coupling with the environment, to 'home base' exploration which is firmly anchored to the environment. this shift also involves switching from momentary and sporadic to repeated returns to a specific, presumably familiar place, to which the animal navigates back from various other places. we suggest that this switching illustrates navigation first by directional and then by positional environmental cues, as hypothesized in the 'parallel map theory'. we also suggest that the transition from looping to home base behavior is part of a hierarchal construction of space representation via three modes of spatial information processing: (i) piloting--sequential processing, based on moving from one landmark to the next; (ii) orienting--parallel processing, based on moving from one point to the next, with the same starting and ending point; (iii) navigating--continuous processing, based on continuously updating the position in relation to several locations in the environment (map navigation).
@method reward processing by the opioid system in the brain. the effects of a repeated treatment with nicotine on the expression of mrnas encoding preproenkephalin (ppe), preprotachykinin‐a (ppt‐a), and preprodynorphin (ppdyn) were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in various subregions of the nucleus accumbens (acb). in saline‐treated rats, optical density measurements on autoradiographic films showed marked anteroposterior decreasing gradients for ppe and ppt‐a mrnas in the rostral pole and the core, in the cone, and in the ventral shell of the acb, whereas a lower anteroposterior gradient was observed for ppdyn mrna signals. the intensity of the three mrna signals also varied according to acb subregion. however, analysis of percentages of prepropeptide mrna‐containing neurons as compared to total neurons showed, in the rostral pole, the core, and the cone, a similar percentage of ppe mrna (around 45%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (around 40%)‐ expressing neurons. the ventral shell can be distinguished from the other subregions by a lower percentage of ppe mrna (35.8%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (30.6%)‐expressing neurons. the percentage of ppdyn mrna‐containing neurons, by contrast, was similar (around 37%) in the core, the cone, and the ventral shell. repeated nicotine administration increases the ppe mrna level in the rostral pole and the anterior third of the core without any change in ppt‐a and ppdyn mrna levels in the various acb subregions examined. the ppe mrna increase does not support an effect mediated through an interaction of nicotine with da neurons. the effect could be linked to a nicotine activation of other afferents to the anterior acb and/or to a direct nicotine stimulation of ppe mrna neurons. © 1996 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background temporal viral genome-protein interactions define distinct stages of productive herpesviral infection herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infects over half the human population. much of the infectious cycle occurs in the nucleus of cells where the virus has evolved mechanisms to manipulate host processes for the production of virus. the genome of hsv-1 is coordinately expressed, maintained, and replicated such that progeny virions are produced within 4–6 hours post infection. in this study, we selectively purify hsv-1 replication forks and associated proteins from virus-infected cells and identify select viral and cellular replication, repair, and transcription factors that associate with viral replication forks. pulse chase analyses and imaging studies reveal temporal and spatial dynamics between viral replication forks and associated proteins and demonstrate that several dna repair complexes and key transcription factors are recruited to or near replication forks. consistent with these observations we show that the initiation of viral dna replication is sufficient to license late gene transcription. these data provide insight into mechanisms that couple hsv-1 dna replication with transcription and repair for the coordinated expression and maintenance of the viral genome.
@background laser-supported partial laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma without ischaemia time objectives the extirpation of peripherally seated renal tumors by partial nephrectomy is an established method. to decrease the disadvantages of vascular hilar clamping, we proved the use of a laser for partial nephrectomy. to date, this laser application has only been described in the animal model.   methods with an exophytic position of the renal tumor, we successfully performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 5 patients.   results regular ultrasound monitoring showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. the serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery.   conclusions the results of our study have shown that laser-supported partial nephrectomy without clamping of the renal vessels, particular in carefully selected patients, is a safe alternative to classic partial nephrectomy.
@method beat tracking with particle filtering algorithms we present a probabilistic generative model for timing deviations in expressive music performance. the structure of the proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model. the switch variables correspond to discrete note locations as in a musical score. the continuous hidden variables denote the tempo. we formulate two well known music recognition problems, namely tempo tracking and automatic transcription (rhythm quantization) as filtering and maximum a posteriori (map) state estimation tasks. exact computation of posterior features such as the map state is intractable in this model class, so we introduce monte carlo methods for integration and optimization. we compare markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods (such as gibbs sampling, simulated annealing and iterative improvement) and sequential monte carlo methods (particle filters). our simulation results suggest better results with sequential methods. the methods can be applied in both online and batch scenarios such as tempo tracking and transcription and are thus potentially useful in a number of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment, score typesetting and music information retrieval.
@method a three-step approach with adaptive additive magnitude selection for the sharpening of images this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
@method reading embossed capital letters: an fmri study in blind and sighted individuals for functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the neural substrates of language, the ability to have subjects performing overt verbal responses while in the scanner environment is important for several reasons. most directly, overt responses allow the investigator to measure the accuracy and reaction time of the behavior. one problem, however, is that magnetic resonance gradient noise obscures the audio recordings made of voice responses, making it difficult to discern subject responses and to calculate reaction times. assert (adaptive spectral subtraction for extracting response times), an algorithm for removing mr gradient noise from audio recordings of subject responses, is described here. the signal processing improves intelligibility of the responses and also allows automated extraction of reaction times. the assert-derived response times were comparable to manually measured times with a mean difference of -8.75 ms (standard deviation of difference = 26.2 ms). these results support the use of assert for the purpose of extracting response latencies and scoring overt verbal responses.
@background opposite effects of weak transcranial direct current stimulation on different phases of short interval intracortical inhibition (sici) short-interval intracortical inhibition (sici) is a widely used method to study cortical inhibition, and abnormalities have been found in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. previous studies suggested that sici involves two phases and the first phase may be explained by axonal refractoriness. our objectives are to further investigate the mechanisms of the two phases of sici. sici was studied in 11 normal volunteers by a paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) paradigm applied to the left motor cortex with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (80% resting motor threshold for rest condition and 95% active motor threshold for active condition) followed by a suprathreshold test stimulus at interstimulus intervals (isis) of 1–4.5 ms in steps of 0.5 ms. motor-evoked potentials (meps) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. three different test stimulus intensities adjusted to produce 0.2, 1 and 4 mv meps at rest were studied with the target muscle relaxed and during 20% maximum contraction. maximum inhibition was observed at isis of 1 ms and 2.5 ms for the rest condition and the difference among isis was reduced with voluntary contraction. sici increased with larger test mep amplitude and decreased with voluntary contraction. at test mep of 0.2 mv, some subjects showed facilitation and this is likely related to short-interval intracortical facilitation. for rest sici, the correlation between adjacent isis was much higher from 3 to 4.5 ms than from 1 to 2.5 ms or between 1 and 2.5 ms. there was no correlation between sici at different test mep amplitudes. we conclude that maximum sici at isis of 1 and 2.5 ms are mediated by different mechanisms. sici at 1 ms cannot be fully explained by axonal refractoriness and synaptic inhibition may be involved. sici is a complex phenomenon and inhibition at different isis may be mediated by different inhibitory circuits.
@background magnetic resonance imaging of shoulder arthroplasty total shoulder arthroplasty, originally used by pean in 1893 to treat tuberculous arthritis1 and subsequently modernized by neer et al. in the 1950s for the treatment of three and four-part proximal humeral fractures2, has demonstrated clinical efficacy when used for the treatment of primary and secondary degenerative conditions of the shoulder. the overall number of shoulder replacements has increased in parallel to the total number of total joint arthroplasties. approximately 7000 total shoulder replacements were performed annually in the united states from 1996 through 2002. this represents a 40% increase compared with the 5000 arthroplasties per year performed from 1990 through 19923-11. despite the increase in the annual volume of shoulder arthroplasties, data have suggested that nearly three-fourths of the operations are performed by surgeons who do two or fewer procedures a year12,13. the favorability of the clinical outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty as well as the decision to proceed with a total shoulder replacement instead of a hemiarthroplasty have been shown to depend on surgeon experience and hospital volume12-16. patient readmission rates, complication rates, and lengths of hospital stays have all been shown to …
@background prospective evaluation of the learning curve of fertiloscopy with and without ovarian drilling. study objective to prospectively analyze the learning curve of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (lavh) in a surgical team and evaluate if length of surgery can be reduced safely.   design prospective observational study (canadian task force classification ii-2).   setting department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university-affiliated hospital.   patients one hundred and sixty consecutive women undergoing lavh performed between january 1, 1998 and april 30, 2001.   intervention lavh (aagl classification system for laparoscopic hysterectomy iii-b-3).   measurements and main results the primary parameter evaluated was length of surgery. patients were grouped in cohorts of 10, in order to perform a time curve that would assist us in evaluation of the learning process. once the plateau was reached, we evaluated the process before and after this plateau (groups 1 [learning stage] and 2 [second stage], respectively). average length of surgery was 126 minutes (range, 60-260). length of surgery was 138 minutes (range, 75-260) in the learning stage (first 80 cases) and 112 minutes (range, 60-225) in the second stage (p <.0001). total rate of complications was 11.6%. there were three major complications, and they occurred before the plateau. there were 15 minor complications (9.67%), 8 during the first stage and 7 in the second stage, (p =.9; ns). a second learning curve excluding lavh with associated surgeries was obtained. the average length of surgery for the first stage was 133 minutes (range, 75-205) and 102 minutes for the second stage (range, 60-130) (p >.0001).   conclusion analysis of the learning curve demonstrated that the length of surgery in lavh could be reduced without increasing the number of complications.
@background connexins are mechanosensitive. gap junction channels are formed by members of the connexin gene family and mediate direct intercellular communication through linked hemichannels (connexons) from each of two adjacent cells. while for most connexins, the hemichannels appear to require an apposing hemichannel to open, macroscopic currents obtained from xenopus oocytes expressing rat cx46 suggested that some hemichannels can be readily opened by membrane depolarization [paul, d. l., ebihara, l., takemoto, l. j., swenson, k. i. & goodenough, d. a. (1991), j. cell biol. 115, 1077-1089]. here we demonstrate by single channel recording that hemichannels comprised of rat cx46 exhibit complex voltage gating consistent with there being two distinct gating mechanisms. one mechanism partially closes cx46 hemichannels from a fully open state, gammaopen, to a substate, gammasub, about one-third of the conductance of gammaopen; these transitions occur when the cell is depolarized to inside positive voltages, consistent with gating by transjunctional voltage in cx46 gap junctions. the other gating mechanism closes cx46 hemichannels to a fully closed state, gammaclosed, on hyperpolarization to inside negative voltages and has unusual characteristics; transitions between gammaclosed and gammaopen appear slow (10-20 ms), often involving several transient substates distinct from gammasub. the polarity of activation and kinetics of this latter form of gating indicate that it is the mechanism by which these hemichannels open in the cell surface membrane when unapposed by another hemichannel. cx46 hemichannels display a substantial preference for cations over anions, yet have a large unitary conductance (approximately 300 ps) and a relatively large pore as inferred from permeability to tetraethylammonium (approximately 8.5 angstroms diameter). these hemichannels open at physiological voltages and could induce substantial cation fluxes in cells expressing cx46.
@background the risk of monozygotic twins after assisted reproductive technology: a systematic review and meta-analysis. objective the purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (mzt) from blastocyst transfer (bt) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.   design retrospective.   setting academic ivf practice.   patient(s) all pregnancies conceived between march 2002 and december 2005 (n = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before march 2002 (n = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) the incidence of mzt with day 3 embryo transfer and bt were compared between the study and control groups.   result(s) during the study period, the rate of mzt was not significantly different for bt at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). this rate of 2.3% for bt was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for bt before march 2002.   conclusion(s) our study suggests that the risk of mzt with bt is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. it is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with bt played a role.
@method title mixture snps effect on phenotype in genome-wide associationstudies abstract a crucial problem in building a multiple regression model is the selection of predictors to include. the main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. this procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. in this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. the computational burden is then alleviated by using the gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the gibbs sample.
@background the rab7 gtpase controls the maturation of salmonella typhimurium‐containing vacuoles in hela cells rab gtpases belong to the ras gtpase superfamily and are key regulators of membrane traffic. among them, rab7 has been localized on late endosomes of nrk cells but its function remains unknown. in order to investigate its role, we generated stable hela cell lines that express either wild type or a gtpase-defective mutant of rab7 in an inducible manner. a morphological analysis of the intracellular localization of these proteins was performed by confocal laser microscopy. here we show that, in hela cells, rab7 is present on a vesicular compartment that extends from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery and shows only a partial colocalization with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a marker for late endosomes. the topology of this compartment is dependent on the microtubule network since nocodazole treatment results in its scattering throughout the cytoplasm. in addition, we observed that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, a rab7 mutant with a reduced gtpase activity is in part associated with lysosomal membranes. this observation was confirmed by subcellular fractionation in a percoll gradient. our data implicate rab7 as the first gtpase functioning on terminal endocytic structures in mammalian cells.
@background microbial community structure at different fermentation stages of kutajarista, a herbal formulation abstract bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. it feeds on mulberry leaves. mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of b. mori, including the gram positive bacillus circulans and gram negative proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, aeromonas sp., and erwinia sp.. three of these isolates, p. vulgaris, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, p. fluorescens and erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and k. pneumoniae degraded starch. aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the cmcellulose and xylan. s. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including cmcellulose, xylan and pectin. b. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. the gut of b. mori has an alkaline ph and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline ph. the number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
@background use of weekly assessment data to enhance evaluation of a subjective wellbeing intervention the timing (spacing) of assessments is an important component of longitudinal research. the purpose of the present study is to determine methods of timing the collection of longitudinal data that provide better parameter recovery in mixed effects nonlinear growth modeling. a simulation study was conducted, varying function type, as well as the number of measurement occasions, in order to examine the effect of timing on the accuracy and efficiency of parameter estimates. the number of measurement occasions was associated with greater efficiency for all functional forms and was associated with greater accuracy for the intrinsically nonlinear functions. in general, concentrating measurement occasions toward the left or at the extremes was associated with increased efficiency when estimating the intercepts of intrinsically linear functions, and concentrating values where the curvature of the function was greatest generally resulted in the best recovery for intrinsically nonlinear functions. results from this study can be used in conjunction with theory to improve the design of longitudinal research studies. in addition, an r program is provided for researchers to run customized simulations to identify optimal sampling schedules for their own research.
@background nonlinear contractions and semigroups in complete fuzzy metric spaces where \p is some function defined on the closure of the range of p. in [3], rakotch proved that if \p(t) =ct(t)t, where a is decreasing and a(t) <1 for i>0, then a mapping satisfying (3) has a unique fixed point x0. it is an easy exercise to show that if \p(t) =a(t)t, where a is increasing, and a(/)<l for t^o, then the conclusion of banach's theorem still holds. we shall show that one need only assume that ip(t) <t for ¿>0, together with a semicontinuity condition on \[/. for a metrically convex space, even this latter condition may be dropped. a number of examples are given to show that the results do in fact improve upon those mentioned above. we wish to thank the referee for suggesting the improved version of theorem 1 which is presented in this paper. we begin with some preliminary results on metrically convex spaces. definition 1 [l, p. 41]. a metric space x is said to be metrically convex if for each x, yex, there is a z^x, y for which p(x, y) =p(x, z) +p(z, y)-
@background monocyte tissue factor-dependent activation of coagulation in hypercholesterolemic mice and monkeys is inhibited by simvastatin. objective—anti-inflammatory effects of statins contribute to their clinical benefit. molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been well explored. because statins attenuate lipopolysaccharide (lps) responsiveness, we hypothesized that part of the pleiotropic effects are mediated through innate immunity. methods and results—toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 expression and downstream signaling in cd14+ monocytes after incubation with simvastatin and atorvastatin were quantified via flow-cytometry, quantitative rt-pcr, kinase assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. incubation with intermediates/ inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway was used to identify the mode of statin action. statin incubation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of tlr4 expression (53±7.6% reduction compared with untreated monocytes; p<0.005), transcript levels (68±6.3%; p<0.002), decreased irak phosphorylation (37±8.3%; p<0.05), and lps-induced il-6, il-12, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-&agr;, and b7-1 expression (p<0.05). four weeks of treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced tlr4 expression on circulating cd14+ monocytes by 36.2±4.2% (p<0.05). effects of statins were reversed by mevalonate (p=0.57). incubation with specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase (54±4.3%), farnesyltransferase (57±5.1%), or with clostridium-difficile toxin b (58±6.1%, p<0.01) imitated the statin effects. whereas wortmannin and ly294002 inhibited the statin effect (p=0.27), incubation with a specific rhoa kinase inhibitor had no effect (p=0.57). conclusions—statins influence tlr4 expression and signaling via inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and farnesylation. these observations imply interactions with innate immunity as one pleiotropic mechanism.
@background effects of electrical stimulation on meat quality of lamb and goat meat our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
@background a preliminary near-infrared spectroscopy study in adolescent and adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) is an optical imaging method, which allows non-invasive in vivo measurements of changes in the concentration of oxygenated (o2hb) and deoxygenated (hhb) haemoglobin in cortical tissue. for the present study, we examined 13 adult adhd patients and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls by means of multi-channel nirs (optical topography; etg-100, hitachi medical co., japan) during performance of a working memory (n-back) paradigm. compared to the healthy control group, adhd patients showed reduced task-related increases in the concentration of o2hb in nirs channels located over the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, indicating reduced activation during performance of the n-back task in this part of the brain. this finding was particularly apparent for the task condition with high working memory load (2-back), and was accompanied by a statistical trend towards an increased number of omission errors in the patient group. the data confirm previous findings of working memory deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in patients suffering from adhd, and are discussed in the light of imaging findings and theoretical models of working memory function.
@method influence of injection site, microvascular pressure and ultrasound variables on microbubble-mediated delivery of microspheres to muscle. background we have previously shown that the application of ultrasound to thin-shelled microbubbles flowing through small microvessels (<7 microm in diameter) produces vessel wall ruptures in vivo. because many intravascular drug- and gene-delivery vehicles are limited by the endothelial barrier, we hypothesized that this phenomenon could be used to deliver drug-bearing vehicles to tissue.   methods and results an exteriorized rat spinotrapezius muscle preparation was used. intravascular fluorescent red blood cells and polymer microspheres (pm) (205 and 503 nm in diameter) were delivered to the interstitium of rat skeletal muscle through microvessel ruptures created by insonifying microbubbles in vivo. on intravital microscopy, mean dispersion areas per rupture for red blood cells, 503-nm pm, and 205-nm pm were 14.5x10(3) microm2, 24. 2x10(3) microm2, and 27.2x10(3) microm2, respectively. pm dispersion areas were significantly larger than the mean dispersion area for red blood cells (p<0.05).   conclusions microvessel ruptures caused by insonification of microbubbles in vivo may provide a minimally invasive means for delivering colloidal particles and engineered red blood cells across the endothelial lining of a targeted tissue region.
@background linear discriminant analysis achieves high classification accuracy for the bold fmri response to naturalistic movie stimuli pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. for example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fmri data with varying degrees of success [nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. in this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (svm), linear discriminant analysis (lda) and gaussian naïve bayes (gnb), using data collected at high field (7 tesla) with higher resolution than usual fmri studies. we investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. the performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. an important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.
@method effects of the gaba‐uptake blocker nnc‐711 on spontaneous sharp wave–ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices cognitive functions go along with complex patterns of distributed activity in neuronal networks, thereby forming assemblies of selected neurons. to support memory processes, such assemblies have to be stabilized and reactivated in a highly reproducible way. the rodent hippocampus provides a well studied model system for network mechanisms underlying spatial memory formation. assemblies of place-encoding cells are repeatedly activated during sleep-associated network states called sharp wave–ripple complexes (spw-rs). behavioral studies suggest that at any time the hippocampus harbors a limited number of different assemblies that are transiently stabilized for memory consolidation. we hypothesized that the corresponding field potentials (sharp wave–ripple complexes) contain a specific signature of the underlying neuronal activity patterns. hence, they should fall into a limited number of different waveforms. application of unbiased sorting algorithms to sharp wave–ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices did indeed reveal the reliable recurrence of defined waveforms that were robust over prolonged recording periods. single-unit discharges tended to fire selectively with certain spw-r classes and were coupled above chance level. thus, field spw-rs of different waveforms are directly related to the underlying multicellular activity patterns that recur with high fidelity. this direct relationship between the coordinated activity of distinct groups of neurons and macroscopic electrographic signals may be important for cognition-related physiological studies in humans and behaving animals.
@method a mixture model for expert finding this paper examines whether the cranfield evaluation methodology is robust to gross violations of the completeness assumption (i.e., the assumption that all relevant documents within a test collection have been identified and are present in the collection). we show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. a new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. this finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.
@background synergistic therapeutic effects of a tumor targeting antibody fragment, fused to interleukin 12 and to tumor necrosis factor alpha. the potential of specifically targeting antineoplastic drugs and toxins to tumors with the use of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) reactive with tumor-associated antigens is currently being examined. n-acetyl-melphalan-moab (n-acmel-moab) conjugates have previously been shown to have greater antitumor activity than n-acmel, melphalan, or moab alone against both subcutaneous and ascites murine thymomas in mice (1). although this conjugate is also a highly selective tumor inhibitor in vitro, it may not reach all the tumor cells in a high concentration, and consequently larger tumors (greater than 0.4 cm2) cannot be eradicated. this conjugate is representative of many drug-moab conjugates in that they are unable to gain adequate access to the tumor site to exert their cytotoxic effect. to potentiate the antitumor effect of the n-acmel-moab conjugate, studies were undertaken to analyze its action in combination with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rtnf-alpha), a monokine, capable of causing acute necrosis of syngeneic tumor transplants in mice. treatment of mice with murine thymomas (0.4 to 0.6 cm2 in size) demonstrated that 30% of the tumors in mice receiving conjugate and rtnf-alpha partially or completely regressed, while no regressions were observed in the tumors of mice receiving n-acmel-anti-ly-2.1 conjugate or rtnf-alpha alone. this and other experiments indicated that the antitumor effect and tumor localization of n-acmel-moab conjugates can be enhanced in vivo by rtnf-alpha, thereby enabling successful eradication of larger established subcutaneous murine tumors.
@background pharmacological and genetic accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α enhances excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor in addition to its potent effects on vasculature, it has become clear that vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has effects on both neurons and glia, and recent studies suggest that it can be neuroprotective. to determine potential mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, recombinant human vegf was bath applied to adult rat hippocampal slices, and both extracellular and intracellular recordings were used to examine intrinsic properties and synaptic responses of hippocampal principal neurons. initial studies in area ca1 showed that vegf significantly reduced the amplitude of responses elicited by schaffer collateral stimulation, without influencing membrane properties. similar effects occurred in ca3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells when their major glutamatergic afferents were stimulated. because vegf expression is increased after seizures, effects of vegf were also examined in rats with recurrent spontaneous seizures. vegf reduced spontaneous discharges in slices from these rats but had surprisingly little effect on epileptiform discharges produced by disinhibition of slices from control rats. these results demonstrate a previously unknown effect of vegf on neuronal activity and also demonstrate a remarkable potency in the epileptic brain. based on this, we suggest that vegf or vegf-related targets could provide useful endpoints to direct novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.
@result ozone co-exposure modifies cardiac responses to fine and ultrafine ambient particulate matter in mice: concordance of electrocardiogram and mechanical responses background human controlled-exposure studies have assessed the impact of ambient fine particulate matter on cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability (hrv), but whether these effects are modified by concomitant ozone exposure remains unknown. objective in this study we assessed the impact of o3 and particulate matter exposure on hrv in humans. methods in a crossover design, 50 subjects (19–48 years of age) were randomized to 2-hr controlled exposures to filtered air (fa), concentrated ambient particles (caps), o3, or combined caps and ozone (caps + o3). the primary end point was change in hrv between the start and end of exposure. secondary analyses included blood pressure (bp) responses, and effect modification by asthmatic status. results achieved mean caps and o3 exposure concentrations were 121.6 ± 48.0 μg/m3 and 113.9 ± 6.6 ppb, respectively. in a categorical analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on hrv indices. however, the dose–response relationship between caps mass concentration and hrv indices seemed to vary depending on the presence of o3. this heterogeneity was statistically significant for the low-frequency component of hrv (p = 0.02) and approached significance for the high-frequency component and time-domain measures of hrv. exposure to caps + o3 increased diastolic bp by 2.0 mmhg (se, 1.2; p = 0.02). no other statistically significant changes in bp were observed. asthmatic status did not modify these effects. conclusion the potentiation by o3 of caps effects on diastolic bp and possibly hrv is of small magnitude in young adults. further studies are needed to assess potential effects in more vulnerable populations.
@background functional and quantitative mri mapping of somatomotor representations of human supralaryngeal vocal tract the sensory projections from the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx are crucial in assuring safe deglutition, coughing, breathing, and voice production/speaking. although several studies using neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated cortical activation related to pharyngeal and laryngeal functions, little is known regarding sensory projections from the laryngeal area to the somatosensory cortex. the purpose of this study was to establish the cortical activity evoked by somatic air-puff stimulation at the laryngeal mucosa using magnetoencephalography. twelve healthy volunteers were trained to inhibit swallowing in response to air stimuli delivered to the larynx. minimum norm estimates was performed on the laryngeal somatosensory evoked fields (lsefs) to best differentiate the target activations from non-task-related activations. evoked magnetic fields were recorded with acceptable reproducibility in the left hemisphere, with a peak latency of approximately 100ms in 10 subjects. peak activation was estimated at the caudolateral region of the primary somatosensory area (s1). these results establish the ability to detect lsefs with an acceptable reproducibility within a single subject and among subjects. these results also suggest the existence of laryngeal somatic afferent input to the caudolateral region of s1 in human. our findings indicate that further investigation in this area is needed, and should focus on laryngeal lateralization, swallowing, and speech processing.
@background usefulness of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration for predicting the severity and mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. purposeto study the impact of inflammation/sepsis on the concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) in plasma and urine in adult intensive care unit (icu) patients and to estimate the predictive properties of ngal in plasma and urine for early detection of acute kidney injury (aki) in patients with septic shock.methodssixty-five patients admitted to the general icu at the karolinska university hospital solna, sweden, with normal plasma creatinine were assessed for eligibility. twenty-seven patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), severe sepsis, or septic shock without aki and 18 patients with septic shock and concomitant aki were included in the final analysis. plasma and urine were analyzed twice daily for plasma ngal (pngal), c-reactive protein (crp), procalcitonin, myeloperoxidase, plasma cystatin c, plasma creatinine, urine ngal (ungal), urine cystatin c, and urine α1-microglobulin.resultsof the 45 patients, 40 had elevated peak levels of pngal. peak levels of pngal were not significantly different between septic shock patients with and without aki. peak levels of ungal were below the upper reference limit in all but four patients without aki. ungal was a good predictor (area under roc 0.86) whereas pngal was a poor predictor (area under roc 0.67) for aki within the next 12 h in patients with septic shock.conclusionspngal is raised in patients with sirs, severe sepsis, and septic shock and should be used with caution as a marker of aki in icu patients with septic shock. ungal is more useful in predicting aki as the levels are not elevated in septic patients without aki.
@background three-dimensional histological specimen preparation for accurate imaging and spatial reconstruction of the middle and inner ear abstract conclusion: candidates for hearing preservation cochlear implant (ci) surgery can be divided into: those who benefit from electrical complement (ec) to remaining hearing and don't require additional amplification, those using a combined electric-acoustic stimulation (eas) and those with the least amount of residual hearing who benefit from electric-only stimulation (es) provided via medium length electrode. objectives: patients with a borderline level of residual hearing may benefit from a hybrid electric stimulation and acoustic amplification (eas) after a cochlear implantation procedure aimed at hearing preservation. however, there is another group of individuals who possess substantial low-frequency residual hearing that is still functional. these partially deaf patients present a ‘cliff-like’ audiogram and have difficulty in comfortable listening, especially in noisy conditions and are deprived of the full enjoyment of music. methods: eleven adults and seven children were implanted via round window with insertion depth intentionally limited to 18–22 mm. none of them could benefit from hearing aids before surgery and they were considered for ec to their residual hearing. results: pure tone audiograms and discrimination scores show benefit from either ec to conserved natural acoustic hearing or eas. one patient with a loss of functional residual hearing benefited from electrical stimulation (es) and a standard ci coding strategy.
@background pseudorabies virus infection alters neuronal activity and connectivity in vitro we provide physiological, pharmacological, and structural evidence that axons of hippocampal principal cells are electrically coupled, with prepotentials or spikelets forming the physiological substrate of electrical coupling as observed in cell somata. antidromic activation of neighboring axons induced somatic spikelet potentials in neurons of ca3, ca1, and dentate gyrus areas of rat hippocampal slices. somatic invasion by these spikelets was dependent on the activation of fast na(+) channels in the postjunctional neuron. antidromically elicited spikelets were suppressed by gap junction blockers and low intracellular ph. paired axo-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings revealed that the coupling potentials appeared in the axon before invading the soma and the dendrite. using confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that putative axons of principal cells were dye coupled. our data thus suggest that hippocampal neurons are coupled by axo-axonal junctions, providing a novel mechanism for very fast electrical communication.
@background chromosomal microarray analysis of consecutive individuals with autism spectrum disorders using an ultra-high resolution chromosomal microarray optimized for neurodevelopmental disorders copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
@background schomburg distance-dependent knowledge-based potential prediction of protein thermostability with a direction-and p < we have developed a method to both predict the geometry and the relative stability of point mutants that may be used for arbitrary mutations. the geometry optimization procedure was first tested on a new benchmark of 2141 ordered pairs of x‐ray crystal structures of proteins that differ by a single point mutation, the largest data set to date. an empirical energy function, which includes terms representing the energy contributions of the folded and denatured proteins and uses the predicted mutant side chain conformation, was fit to a training set consisting of half of a diverse set of 1816 experimental stability values for single point mutations in 81 different proteins. the data included a substantial number of small to large residue mutations not considered by previous prediction studies. after removing 22 (≈2%) outliers, the stability calculation gave a standard deviation of 1.08 kcal/mol with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. the prediction method was then tested on the remaining half of the experimental data, giving a standard deviation of 1.10 kcal/mol and covariance of 0.66 for 97% of the test set. a regression fit of the energy function to a subset of 137 mutants, for which both native and mutant structures were available, gave a prediction error comparable to that for the complete training set with predicted side chain conformations. we found that about half of the variation is due to conformation‐independent residue contributions. finally, a fit to the experimental stability data using these residue parameters exclusively suggests guidelines for improving protein stability in the absence of detailed structure information. proteins 2004. © 2004 wiley‐liss, inc.
@result regulation of insulin gene expression by cytokines and cell–cell interactions in mouse medullary thymic epithelial cells cd7 and cd28 are ig superfamily molecules expressed on thymocytes and mature t cells that share common signaling 0mechanisms and are co-mitogens for t cell activation. cd7-deficient mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced shock syndrome, and have diminished in vivo lps-triggered ifn-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha production. cd28-deficient mice have decreased serum ig levels, defective igg isotype switching, decreased t cell il-2 production and are resistant to staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-induced shock. to determine synergistic roles cd7 and cd28 might play in thymocyte development and function, we have generated and characterized cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice. cd7/cd28-deficient mice were healthy, reproduced normally, had normal numbers of thymocyte subsets and had normal thymus histology. anti-cd3 mab induced similar levels of apoptosis in cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28 double-deficient thymocytes as in control c57bl/6 mice (p = ns). similarly, thymocyte viability, apoptosis and necrosis following ionomycin or dexamethasone treatment were the same in control, cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient mice. cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes had decreased [3h]thymidine incorporation responses to concanavalin a (con a) stimulation compared to control mice (p < or = 0.01 and p < or = 0.05 respectively). cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice had significantly reduced numbers of b7-1/b7-2 double-positive cells compared to freshly isolated wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient thymocytes. con a-stimulated cd4/cd8 double-negative (dn) thymocytes from cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice expressed significantly lower levels of cd25 when compared to cd4/cd8 dn thymocytes from wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < 0.05). anti-cd3-triggered cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes also had decreased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production compared to c57bl/6 control, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < or = 0.05). thus, cd7 and cd28 deficiencies combined to produce abnormalities in the absolute number of b7-1/b7-2-expressing cells in the thymus, thymocyte il-2 receptor expression and cd3-triggered cytokine production.
@background nitric oxide activates an nrf2/sulfiredoxin antioxidant pathway in macrophages. neutrophils and other phagocytes manufacture o(2)(-) (superoxide) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen at the expense of nadph. most of the o(2)(-) reacts with itself to form h(2)o(2) (hydrogen peroxide). from these agents a large number of highly reactive microbicidal oxidants are formed, including hocl (hypochlorous acid), which is produced by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of cl(-) by h(2)o(2); oh(*) (hydroxyl radical), produced by the reduction of h(2)o(2) by fe(++) or cu(+); onoo(-) (peroxynitrite), formed by the reaction between o(2)(-) and no(*); and many others. these reactive oxidants are manufactured for the purpose of killing invading microorganisms, but they also inflict damage on nearby tissues, and are thought to be of pathogenic significance in a large number of diseases. included among these are emphysema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, atherosclerosis, reperfusion injury, malignancy and rheumatoid arthritis.
@method does evolution cause a domain shift in real-world applications of visual recognition, many factors - such as pose, illumination, or image quality - can cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. as such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. in this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. we also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. for a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over competing methods.
@method self-informed neural network structure learning despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
@background enhanced expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in aniline-induced cell proliferation in rat spleen. cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
@background reverse projection retrieval in edge illumination x-ray phase contrast computed tomography x-ray phase contrast imaging is probably the most relevant among emerging x-ray imaging techniques, and it has the proven potential of revolutionizing the field of diagnostic radiology. impressive images of a wide range of samples have been obtained, mostly at synchrotron radiation facilities. the necessity of relying on synchrotron radiation has prevented to a large extent a widespread diffusion of phase contrast imaging, thus precluding its transfer to clinical practice. a new technique, based on the use of coded apertures, was recently developed at ucl. this technique was demonstrated to provide intense phase contrast signals with conventional x-ray sources and detectors. unlike other attempts at making phase contrast imaging feasible with conventional sources, the coded-aperture approach does not impose substantial limitations and/or filtering of the radiation beam, and it therefore allows, for the first time, exposures compatible with clinical practice. the technique has been thoroughly modelled, and this paper describes the technique in detail by going through the different steps of the modelling. all the main factors influencing image quality are discussed, alongside the viability of realizing a prototype suitable for clinical use. the model has been experimentally validated and a section of the paper shows the comparison between simulated and experimental results.
@method individual differences in susceptibility to false memory in the deese-roediger-mcdermott paradigm. r. e. smith and r. r. hunt (1998) reported a dramatic reduction in false remembering in a list-learning paradigm by switching from auditory to visual presentation at study. the current authors replicated these modality effects using written recall and visual recognition tests but obtained smaller effects than those in r. e. smith and r. r. hunt's study. in contrast, no modality effect occurred on auditory recognition tests. manipulating study and test modality within-subjects (experiment 2) and between-subjects (experiment 3) yielded similar results. it was also found that subjects frequently judged critical nonstudied words as having been presented in the modality of their corresponding study lists. the authors concluded that subjects could retrieve distinctive information about a study list's presentation modality to reduce false remembering but only did so under certain conditions. the modality effect on false remembering is a function of both encoding and retrieval factors.
@background pitx3 dna methylation is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma gene amplification, a common mechanism for oncogene activation in cancer, has been used as a tag for the identification of novel oncogenes. dna amplification is frequently observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) and potential oncogenes have already been reported. we applied restriction landmark genome scanning (rlgs) to study gene amplifications and low-level copy number changes in hnscc in order to locate previously uncharacterized regions with copy number gains in primary tumor samples. a total of 63 enhanced rlgs fragments, indicative of dna copy number changes, including gains of single alleles, were scored. enhanced sequences were identified from 33 different chromosomal regions including those previously reported (e.g. 3q26.3 and 11q13.3) as well as novel regions (e.g. 3q29, 8q13.1, 8q22.3, 9q32, 10q24.32, 14q32.32, 17q25.1 and 20q13.33). furthermore, our data suggest that amplicons 11q13.3 and 3q26.3–q29 may be divided into possibly two and three independent amplicons, respectively, an observation supported by published microarray expression data.
@background herbicide injury induces dna methylome alterations in arabidopsis glyphosate is a systemic, nonselective and most widely used herbicide in the world. the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops in the mid-1990s resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of glyphosate herbicide making it most widely used herbicide in the world. the average maize yield loss in the field caused by pests is around 20 % but in many regions it is much higher. it is now clear that glyphosate causes broader range of physiological alterations than previously assumed and some plants gain higher level of resistance to glyphosate without the need to use genetic engineering methods. to understand the mechanisms of such heightened resistance we must first know the processes mediating the plants’ death in response to glyphosate treatment. here, we show that 12 mirnas, belonging to mir167, mir396, mir159, mir156, mir169, mir444 and mir827 families, are significantly upregulated, and one, mir166, downregulated following glyphosate treatment. these mirnas have been previously shown to be involved in abiotic stress responses and implicated in senescence. strikingly, two of the induced mirnas, mir444 and mir827, have been shown to regulate phosphate transport pathways, which seem to be common for pi and glyphosate uptake.
@result medial prefrontal default-mode hypoactivity affecting trait physical anhedonia in schizophrenia background there have been reports that patients with schizophrenia have decreased metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex. however, findings have been confounded by medication effects, chronic illness, and difficulties of measurement. we aimed to address these problems by examination of cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography (pet).   methods we studied 17 neuroleptic-naïve patients at the early stages of illness by means of image analysis and statistical methods that can detect abnormalities at the gyral level.   findings an initial omnibus test with a randomisation analysis indicated that patients differed from normal controls at the 0.06 level. in the follow-up analysis, three separate prefrontal regions had decreased perfusion (lateral, orbital, medial), as well as regions in inferior temporal and parietal cortex that are known to be anatomically connected. regions with increased perfusion were also identified (eg, thalamus, cerebellum, retrosplenial cingulate), which suggests an imbalance in distributed cortical and subcortical circuits.   interpretation these distributed dysfunctional circuits may form the neural basis of schizophrenia through cognitive impairment of the brain, which prevents it from processing input efficiently and producing output effectively, thereby leading to symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and loss of volition.
@method male contraceptive efficacy of poly herbal formulation, contracept-tm, composed of aqueous extracts of terminalia chebula fruit and musa balbisiana seed in rat an enzymatic method is described for determination of total serum cholesterol by use of a single aqueous reagent. the method requires no prior treatment of sample and the calibration curve is linear to 600 mg/dl. cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol by cholesterol ester hydrolase (ec 3.1.1.13). the free cholesterol produced is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to cholest-4-en-3-one with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidatively couples with 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol in the presence of peroxidase to yield a chromogen with maximum absorption at 500 nm. the method is reproducible, and the results correlate well with those obtained by automated liebermann—burchard procedures (aa-2 and sma 12/60) and the method of abell et al. the present method affords better specificity than those previously reported and has excellent precision.
@background overexpression of npr1 in brassica juncea confers broad spectrum resistance to fungal pathogens the key regulator of salicylic acid (sa)-mediated resistance, npr1, is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (oryza sativa l.). investigation in depth is needed to provide an understanding of npr1-mediated resistance and a practical strategy for the improvement of disease resistance in the model crop rice. the rice genome contains five npr1-like genes. in our study, three rice homologous genes, osnpr1/nh1, osnpr2/nh2 and osnpr3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and rice blast magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. we confirmed that osnpr1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the arabidopsis npr1 mutant. over-expression of osnpr1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants. the osnpr1-green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and moved into the nucleus after redox change. mutations in its conserved cysteine residues led to the constitutive localization of osnpr1(2ca)-gfp in the nucleus and also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity in transgenic rice. different subcellular localizations of osnpr1 antagonistically regulated sa- and jasmonic acid (ja)-responsive genes, but not sa and ja levels, indicating that osnpr1 might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the sa- and ja-dependent pathways in rice. this study demonstrates that rice has evolved an sa-mediated systemic acquired resistance similar to that in arabidopsis, and also provides a practical approach for the improvement of disease resistance without the penalty of decreased herbivore resistance in rice.
@background characterization of four defense-related genes up-regulated in root nodules of casuarina glauca plant peroxidases (class iii peroxidases) are present in all land plants. they are members of a large multigenic family. probably due to this high number of isoforms, and to a very heterogeneous regulation of their expression, plant peroxidases are involved in a broad range of physiological processes all along the plant life cycle. due to two possible catalytic cycles, peroxidative and hydroxylic, peroxidases can generate reactive oxygen species (ros) (•oh, hoo•), polymerise cell wall compounds, and regulate h2o2 levels. by modulating their activity and expression following internal and external stimuli, peroxidases are prevalent at every stage of plant growth, including the demands that the plant meets in stressful conditions. these multifunctional enzymes can build a rigid wall or produce ros to make it more flexible; they can prevent biological and chemical attacks by raising physical barriers or by counterattacking with a large production of ros; they can be involved in a more peaceful symbiosis. they are finally present from the first hours of a plant’s life until its last moments. although some functions look paradoxical, the whole process is probably regulated by a fine-tuning that has yet to be elucidated. this review will discuss the factors that can influence this delicate balance.
@background photochemical transformation of benzotriazole, relevant to sunlit surface waters: assessing the possible role of triplet-sensitised processes. the occurrence and removal of 58 pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pesticides, were assessed in the wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) of the city of lausanne, switzerland, as well as in the effluent-receiving water body, the vidy bay of lake geneva. an analytical screening method to simultaneously measure all of the 58 micropollutants was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (uplc-ms/ms). the selection of pharmaceuticals was primarily based on a prioritization study, which designated them as environmentally relevant for the lake geneva region. except for the endocrine disruptor 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, all substances were detected in 24-h composite samples of wastewater entering the wwtp or in the treated effluent. of these compounds, 40% were also detected in raw drinking water, pumped from the lake 3 km downstream of the wwtp. the contributions of dilution and degradation to micropollutant elimination between the wwtp outlet and the raw drinking water intake were established in different model scenarios using hypothetical residence times of the wastewater in vidy bay of 1, 4, or 90 d. concentration decrease due to processes other than dilution was observed for diclofenac, beta-blockers, several antibiotics, corrosion inhibitors, and pesticides. measured environmental concentrations (mecs) of pharmaceuticals were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (pecs) determined in the prioritization study and agreed within one order of magnitude, but mecs were typically greater than the corresponding pecs. predicted no-effect concentrations of the analgesic paracetamol, and the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, were exceeded in raw drinking water samples and therefore present a potential risk to the ecosystem.
@background effect of planar cuts' orientation on the perceived surface layout and object's shape. most existing computational models of the visual perception of three-dimensional shape from texture are based on assumed constraints about how texture is distributed on visible surfaces. the research described in the present article was designed to investigate how violations of these assumptions influence human perception. observers were presented with images of smoothly curved surfaces depicted with different types of texture, whose distribution of surface markings could be both anisotropic and inhomogeneous. observers judged the pattern of ordinal depth on each object by marking local maxima and minima along designated scan lines. they also judged the apparent magnitudes of relative depth between designated probe points on the surface. the results revealed a high degree of accuracy and reliability in all conditions, except for a systematic underestimation of the overall magnitude of surface relief. these findings suggest that human perception of three-dimensional shape from texture is much more robust than would be reasonable to expect based on current computational models of this phenomenon.
@method the importance of window length in splice site prediction we describe a novel analytical approach to gene recognition based on cross-species comparison we first undertook a comparison of orthologous genomic look from human and mouse, studying the extent of similarity in the number, size and sequence of exons and introns we then developed an approach for recognizing genes within such orthologous regions, by first aligning the regions using an iterative global alignment system and then identifying genes based on conservation of exonic features at aligned positions in both species the alignment and gene recognition are performed by new programs called glass and rosetta, respectively rosetta performed well at exact identification of coding exons in 117 orthologous pairs tested.
@method rotated word vector representations and their interpretability recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. we analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. the result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. the model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. it also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.

@method br-signaling kinase1 physically associates with flagellin sensing2 and regulates plant innate immunity in arabidopsis[w] we have identified an arabidopsis mutant that displays enhanced disease resistance (edr2) to the biotrophic powdery mildew pathogen erysiphe cichoracearum. inhibition of fungal growth on edr2 mutant leaves occurred at a late stage of the infection process and coincided with formation of necrotic lesions approximately 5 days after inoculation. double-mutant analysis revealed that edr2-mediated resistance is suppressed by mutations that inhibit salicylic acid (sa)-induced defense signaling, including npr1, pad4 and sid2, demonstrating that edr2-mediated disease resistance is dependent on sa. however, edr2 showed normal responses to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000. edr2 appears to be constitutively transcribed in all tissues and organs and encodes a novel protein, consisting of a putative pleckstrin homology (ph) domain and a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid-transfer (start) domain, and contains an n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. the ph and start domains are implicated in lipid binding, suggesting that edr2 may provide a link between lipid signaling and activation of programmed cell death mediated by mitochondria.
@method mitochondrial β-cyanoalanine synthase is essential for root hair formation in arabidopsis thaliana[w] motivation dna microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. the probability that a false identification (type i error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. in this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (fdr) controlling approach. in order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based fdr controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the naïve application of the linear step-up procedure in benjamini and hochberg (1995). the procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation.   results comparative simulation analysis shows that all four fdr controlling procedures control the fdr at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. in terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the naïve one. the highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of fdr control.   availability an r program that adjusts p-values using fdr controlling procedures is freely available over the internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenja.
@method quality of life measurement in the palliative management of advanced cancer purpose we developed and validated a brief, yet sensitive, 33-item general cancer quality-of-life (ql) measure for evaluating patients receiving cancer treatment, called the functional assessment of cancer therapy (fact) scale.   methods and results the five-phase validation process involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists. the initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was generated by open-ended interview with patients experienced with the symptoms of cancer and oncology professionals. using preselected criteria, items were reduced to a 38-item general version. factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on 545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 28-item fact-general (fact-g, version 2). in addition to a total score, this version produces subscale scores for physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being, as well as satisfaction with the treatment relationship. coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. the scale's ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance status rating (psr), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. it has also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time. finally, the validity of measuring separate areas, or dimensions, of ql was supported by the differential responsiveness of subscales when applied to groups known to differ along the dimensions of physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being.   conclusion the fact-g meets or exceeds all requirements for use in oncology clinical trials, including ease of administration, brevity, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to clinical change. selecting it for a clinical trial adds the capability to assess the relative weight of various aspects of ql from the patient's perspective.

@background kaposiform hemangioendothelioma of the spleen in an adult: an initial case report we report the clinical and pathological features of nine distinctive, but relatively unknown, vascular tumors of infancy and childhood presenting as soft tissue masses often associated with locally aggressive disease, lymphangiomatosis and kasabach-merritt syndrome. the patients, four males and five females, were all in their first decade of life except for two (median, 2 years; range, 5 months to 19 years). these tumors involved deep soft tissues of the upper extremity (four cases), retroperitoneum (two cases), chest wall, scalp, and neck (one case each). four patients also had kasabach-merritt syndrome, and three patients had lymphangiomatosis. lymphangiomatosis consisted of diffusely infiltrating lymphangioma of soft tissue (three cases) and in two by the additional presence of bone lesions. in one of these three cases, lymphangiomatosis antedated the diagnosis of the vascular tumor, and in the remainder they were concurrently diagnosed. tumors were characterized by infiltrating, interconnecting sheets or irregular nodules of slender endothelial cells lining crescentic or slit-like vessels and, less commonly, rounded capillary-type vessels. within some tumors, nests of epithelioid endothelial cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm containing finely granular hemosiderin, hyaline droplets, and cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified. smaller amounts of hemosiderin were observed within the spindled endothelial cells and microthrombi could be seen occasionally within the tiny lumina. nuclear atypia was minimal within these tumors and mitotic figures were infrequent, averaging 2 to 3/10 high-power fields (hpf) (range 0-7/10 hpf). larger, well-formed feeding vessels were present at the periphery of the tumor. the endothelium of these vessels expressed factor viii-ag, cd34, and bound ulex europaeus, and muscle- specific actin. in contrast, the spindled tumor cells expressed only cd34. human papilloma virus (hpv)-16- like dna transcripts, which have been identified in cases of kaposi's sarcoma, were not detected by polymerase chain reaction in two cases. follow-up information revealed that four patients were alive without disease after wide excision, multiple excision(s), or amputation (one case); three were alive with disease; and two died, one from lymphangiomatosis with respiratory compromise and the other from hemorrhage complicating kasabach-merritt syndrome. it appears that treatment should consist of wide local excision and supportive therapy for associated symptoms.
@background integrative genomic analysis in k562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells reveals that proximal ncor1 binding positively regulates genes that govern erythroid differentiation and imatinib sensitivity lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1, kdm1a) functions as a transcriptional corepressor through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (h3k4) but has a coactivator function on some genes through mechanisms that are unclear. we show that lsd1, interacting with corest, associates with and coactivates androgen receptor (ar) on a large fraction of androgen-stimulated genes. a subset of these ar/lsd1-associated enhancer sites have histone 3 threonine 6 phosphorylation (h3t6ph), and these sites are further enriched for androgen-stimulated genes. significantly, despite its coactivator activity, lsd1 still mediates h3k4me2 demethylation at these androgen-stimulated enhancers. foxa1 is also associated with lsd1 at ar-regulated enhancer sites, and a foxa1 interaction with lsd1 enhances binding of both proteins at these sites. these findings show that lsd1 functions broadly as a regulator of ar function, that it maintains a transcriptional repression function at ar-regulated enhancers through h3k4 demethylation, and that it has a distinct ar-linked coactivator function mediated by demethylation of other substrates.
@method generation of lycopene-overproducing strains of the fungus mucor circinelloides reveals important aspects of lycopene formation and accumulation sexual crosses between strains of phycomyces blakesleeanus , involving three auxotrophic and one color marker and yielding a high proportion of zygospore germination, are described. samples of 20-40 germ spores from 311 individual fertile germ sporangia originating from five two-factor and three three-factor crosses were characterized. the results show: (1) absence of any contribution of apogamic nuclei to the progeny, (2) confirmation of burgeff's conjecture that the germ spores of any germ sporangium in most cases derive from one meiosis. in a cross involving two allelic markers the analysis of 175 pooled germ sporangia suggests an intragenic recombination frequency of 0.6%. all other factor combinations tested are unlinked. the bulk of the germ spores are homokaryotic. however, a small portion (4%) are heterokaryotic with respect to mating type.
@background pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling of antipsychotic drugs in patients with schizophrenia: part ii: the use of subscales of the panss score background to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) model using individual-level data of positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) total score to characterize the antipsychotic drug effect taking into account the placebo effect and dropout rate. in addition, a clinical utility (cu) criterion that describes the usefulness of a drug therapy was calculated using the efficacy of the drug and dropout rates.   methods data from 12 clinical trials in schizophrenia patients was used to quantify the effects of the antipsychotic drugs (aps), namely, haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone and paliperidone. compartmental pk models were used to describe the time course of plasma drug concentrations. the combination of an emax and the weibull model was used to describe the drug and placebo effects. the steady-state drug concentrations were assumed to be the drivers of the exposure-response relationship. an exponential model was utilized to identify the predictors of probability of dropout. simulations were performed to check the predictability of the model, and to calculate the cu of the drugs based on panss scores and dropout rates.   results the maximal drug effect (e(max)) was highest for olanzapine whilst it was lowest for ziprasidone. higher observed panss scores resulted in a greater likelihood of dropout. taking into account the efficacy and the drop-out rate, all aps possessed a comparable cu at the therapeutic doses. the resulting pk-pd model parameters were used to compute the effective concentration and dose required to produce a clinically meaningful 30% drop in panss score from the baseline.   conclusions the developed pk-pd model and the associated cu score allow the evaluation of the time course of the panss scores of the different aps and a proper comparison of their clinically relevant treatments effects.
@background aryl hydrocarbon receptor is required for optimal b‐cell proliferation recent advances in genomics and proteomics, combined with the facilitated generation and analysis of transgenic and gene-knockout animals, have revealed new complexities in classical biological systems, including the b-cell compartment. studies on an 'old', but poorly characterized, b-cell subset — the naive, marginal-zone (mz) b-cell subset — over the past two years have spawned an avalanche of data that encompass the generation and function of these cells. now that the initial 'infatuation' is over, it is time to reconsider these data and generate some conclusions that can be incorporated into a working model of the b-cell system.

@background maternal protein restriction before pregnancy reduces offspring early body mass and affects glucose metabolism in c57bl/6jbom mice. epidemiological studies have indicated that susceptibility of human adults to hypertension and cardiovascular disease may result from intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight induced by maternal undernutrition. although the 'foetal origins of adult disease' hypothesis has significant relevance to preventative healthcare, the origin and biological mechanisms of foetal programming are largely unknown. here, we investigate the origin, embryonic phenotype and potential maternal mechanisms of programming within an established rat model. maternal low protein diet (lpd) fed during only the preimplantation period of development (0-4.25 days after mating), before return to control diet for the remainder of gestation, induced programming of altered birthweight, postnatal growth rate, hypertension and organ/body-weight ratios in either male or female offspring at up to 12 weeks of age. preimplantation embryos collected from dams after 0-4.25 days of maternal lpd displayed significantly reduced cell numbers, first within the inner cell mass (icm; early blastocyst), and later within both icm and trophectoderm lineages (mid/late blastocyst), apparently induced by a slower rate of cellular proliferation rather than by increased apoptosis. the lpd regimen significantly reduced insulin and essential amino acid levels, and increased glucose levels within maternal serum by day 4 of development. our data indicate that long-term programming of postnatal growth and physiology can be induced irreversibly during the preimplantation period of development by maternal protein undernutrition. further, we propose that the mildly hyperglycaemic and amino acid-depleted maternal environment generated by undernutrition may act as an early mechanism of programming and initiate conditions of 'metabolic stress', restricting early embryonic proliferation and the generation of appropriately sized stem-cell lineages.
@background response properties underlying selectivity for the rate of frequency modulated sweeps in the auditory cortex of the mouse the auditory nerve isoelectric thresholds, in response to tone pigs ranging from 5 to 20 khz, are similar in the young c57bl/6 and cba/j mice, although the latter genotype has somewhat more sensitive responses from 30 to 80 khz. but their behavioral audiograms, obtained by the classical conditioning technique of ehret, are very discrepant. even though the behavioral audiogram of the cba/j mouse can be predicted by measurements from its auditory nerve, the behavioral thresholds of the young c57bl/6 mouse are approximately 40 db less sensitive than its electrophysiological measurements. cochlear hair cell loss was not evident in young mice of either genotype. as the cba/j approaches the end of its predicted life span, its auditory anatomy, physiology and behavior are not significantly altered; but those rare individuals, who exceed their predicted life span by 40% finally develop hearing loss of a mixed nature. by contrast, the c57bl/6 mouse shows a relatively rapid decline of hearing as it ages. by 200 days of age, its auditory nerve responses are 30 db less sensitive at 5 khz, and 55 db less sensitive at 30 khz, than similar measures taken at adolescence. over this same age span, its behavioral sensitivity has only declined by 15 and 25 db at these two frequencies. hair cell counts correlated poorly with both behavioral and electrophysiological auditory measures in the c57bl/6 mouse.
@background cancer and fertility preservation: barcelona consensus meeting several lines of evidence demonstrate that the biology, genetics and environment of childhood solid tumours (csts) sets them apart from adult solid tumours. the nature of the progenitor cells from which these tumours arise, and their immature tissue environment, allows csts to develop with fewer defects in cell regulatory processes than adult cancers. these differences could explain why csts are more susceptible to therapeutic intervention than adult tumours. how does the aetiology of these cancers differ from those occurring in adults and how might this affect the development of more effective therapies?
@method fine-mapping the wheat snn1 locus conferring sensitivity to the parastagonospora nodorum necrotrophic effector sntox1 using an eight founder multiparent advanced generation inter-cross population high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping arrays are a powerful tool for studying genomic patterns of diversity, inferring ancestral relationships between individuals in populations and studying marker–trait associations in mapping experiments. we developed a genotyping array including about 90 000 gene-associated snps and used it to characterize genetic variation in allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheat populations. the array includes a significant fraction of common genome-wide distributed snps that are represented in populations of diverse geographical origin. we used density-based spatial clustering algorithms to enable high-throughput genotype calling in complex data sets obtained for polyploid wheat. we show that these model-free clustering algorithms provide accurate genotype calling in the presence of multiple clusters including clusters with low signal intensity resulting from significant sequence divergence at the target snp site or gene deletions. assays that detect low-intensity clusters can provide insight into the distribution of presence–absence variation (pav) in wheat populations. a total of 46 977 snps from the wheat 90k array were genetically mapped using a combination of eight mapping populations. the developed array and cluster identification algorithms provide an opportunity to infer detailed haplotype structure in polyploid wheat and will serve as an invaluable resource for diversity studies and investigating the genetic basis of trait variation in wheat.
@background trends in the use of natural antioxidants in active food packaging: a review this research was aimed at evaluating the inhibition of oxidative changes of beef patties packaged in modified atmosphere (70% o(2)+20% co(2)+10% n(2)) by natural antioxidants: ascorbic acid (500 ppm), taurine (50 mm), carnosine (50 mm), rosemary powder (1000 ppm) and their combinations with the first. beef patties stored at 2±1°c for 20 days were evaluated for colour (l*, a*, b*, c* and h*), tbars, metmyoglobin formation (% of total myoglobin), psychrotrophic microbial counts and sensory odour and discolouration. rosemary, either alone or with ascorbic acid, was highly effective in inhibiting both metmyoglobin formation and lipid oxidation; sensory analysis was in agreement with these results. ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid+taurine and ascorbic acid+carnosine treatments showed a limited inhibitory effect of myoglobin oxidation, while carnosine and carnosine+ascorbic acid were effective in inhibiting lipid oxidation. taurine alone failed to exert any antioxidant effect. principal components analysis confirmed these results.
@background a stage for social comparison - the value of information in virtual communities hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
@background histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
@background spiroindolines identify the vesicular acetylcholine transporter as a novel target for insecticide action the past 30 years have witnessed a period of significant expansion in the use of halogenated compounds in the field of agrochemical research and development. the introduction of halogens into active ingredients has become an important concept in the quest for a modern agrochemical with optimal efficacy, environmental safety, user friendliness and economic viability. outstanding progress has been made, especially in synthetic methods for particular halogen-substituted key intermediates that were previously prohibitively expensive. interestingly, there has been a rise in the number of commercial products containing 'mixed' halogens, e.g. one or more fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms in addition to one or more further halogen atoms. extrapolation of the current trend indicates that a definite growth is to be expected in fluorine-substituted agrochemicals throughout the twenty-first century. a number of these recently developed agrochemical candidates containing halogen substituents represent novel classes of chemical compounds with new modes of action. however, the complex structure-activity relationships associated with biologically active molecules mean that the introduction of halogens can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the efficacy of a compound, depending on its changed mode of action, physicochemical properties, target interaction or metabolic susceptibility and transformation. in spite of modern design concepts, it is still difficult to predict the sites in a molecule at which halogen substitution will result in optimal desired effects. this review describes comprehensively the successful utilisation of halogens and their unique role in the design of modern agrochemicals, exemplified by various commercial products from bayer cropscience coming from different agrochemical areas.
@background a ubiquitin-binding protein, faap20, links rnf8-mediated ubiquitination to the fanconi anemia dna repair network. cells from fanconi anemia (fa) patients are extremely sensitive to dna interstrand crosslinking (icl) agents, but the molecular basis of the hypersensitivity remains to be explored. fancm (fa complementation group m), and its binding partner, faap24, anchor the multisubunit fa core complex to chromatin after dna damage and may contribute to icl-specific cellular response. here we show that the fancm/faap24 complex is specifically required for the recruitment of replication protein a (rpa) to icl-stalled replication forks. icl-induced rpa foci formation requires the dna-binding activity of faap24 but not the dna translocase activity of fancm. furthermore, fancm/faap24-dependent rpa foci formation is required for efficient atr-mediated checkpoint activation in response to icl. therefore, we propose that fancm/faap24 plays a role in icl-induced checkpoint activation through regulating rpa recruiment at icl-stalled replication forks.
@method antiplatelet therapy, but not intravenous thrombolytic therapy, is associated with postoperative bleeding complications after decompressive craniectomy for stroke object the object of this study was to describe the rapid closure technique in decompressive craniectomy without duraplasty and its use in a large cohort of consecutive patients.   methods between 1999 and 2008, supratentorial rapid closure decompressive craniectomy (rcdc) was performed 341 times in 318 patients at the authors' institution. cases were stratified as 1) traumatic brain injury, 2) subarachnoid hemorrhage, 3) intracerebral hemorrhage, 4) cerebral infarction, and 5) other. a large bone flap was removed and the dura mater was opened in a stellate fashion. duraplasty was not performed-that is, the dura was not sutured, and a dural substitute was neither sutured in nor layed on. the dura and exposed brain tissue were covered with hemostyptic material (surgicel). surgical time and complications of this procedure including follow-up (> 6 months) were recorded. after 3-6 months cranioplasty was performed, and, again, surgical time and any complications were recorded.   results rapid closure decompressive craniectomy was feasible in all cases. complications included superficial wound healing disturbance (3.5% of procedures), abscess (2.6%) and csf fistula (0.6%); the mean surgical time (± sd) was 69 ± 20 minutes. cranioplasty was performed in 196 cases; the mean interval (± sd) from craniectomy to cranioplasty was 118 ± 40 days. complications of cranioplasty included epidural hematoma (4.1%), abscess (2.6%), wound healing disturbance (6.1%), and csf fistula (1%). compared with the results reported in the literature for decompressive craniectomy with duraplasty followed by cranioplasty, there were no significant differences in the frequency of complications. however, surgical time for rcdc was significantly shorter (69 ± 20 vs 129 ± 43 minutes, p < 0.0001).   conclusions the present analysis of the largest series reported to date reveals that the rapid closure technique is feasible and safe in decompressive craniectomy. the surgical time is significantly shorter without increased complication rates or additional complications. cranioplasty after a rcdc procedure was also feasible, fast, safe and not impaired by the rcdc technique.
@background rickettsial outer‐membrane protein b (rompb) mediates bacterial invasion through ku70 in an actin, c‐cbl, clathrin and caveolin 2‐dependent manner increasing evidence indicates that pathogens have evolved highly efficient strategies to induce their internalization within host cells. viruses and bacteria express and expose on their surface, molecules that mimic endogenous ligands to cell receptors, thereby inducing specific intracellular signalling cascades. more recently it has become clear that, as most viruses, bacteria can enter cells via the clathrin‐mediated pathway, indicating a key role for endocytosis in pathogens entry into cells. here we review the pathways followed by listeria monocytogenes to enter into non‐phagocytic cells, as a model for the subversion of cellular functions to induce pathogens internalization.
@background for whom and under what circumstances do school-based energy balance behavior interventions work? systematic review on moderators specific interventions included in the review studies that assessed policy or environmental interventions to promote physical activity and/or good nutrition were eligible for inclusion. studies had to describe the intervention to be included. the environment was defined as 'anything and everything outside the person', while environmental strategies were defined as those that involved changing the physical, social-cultural, economic or organisational systems to promote behaviour change. studies that assessed educational strategies at the individual level but focused mainly on environmental strategies were eligible for inclusion. to be included in the review, studies had to report tests of interaction or moderation between the intervention studied and a second independent variable. studies on the effects of media campaigns, determinants research, or individual-level interventions were excluded.
@background dynamic x-ray diffraction imaging of the ferroelectric response in bismuth ferrite using in situ high-resolution synchrotron x-ray scattering, the curie temperature tc has been determined for ultrathin c-axis epitaxial pbtio3 films on conducting substrates (srruo3 on srtio3), with surfaces exposed to a controlled vapor environment. the suppression of tc was relatively small, even for the thinnest film (1.2 nm). we observe that 180 degrees stripe domains do not form, indicating that the depolarizing field is compensated by free charge at both interfaces. this is confirmed by ab initio calculations that find polar ground states in the presence of ionic adsorbates.
@background astrocytic probdnf and tonic gaba distinguish active versus reactive astrocytes in hippocampus activity-dependent secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) is thought to enhance synaptic plasticity, but the mechanisms controlling extracellular availability and clearance of secreted bdnf are poorly understood. we show that bdnf is secreted in its precursor form (pro-bdnf) and is then cleared from the extracellular space through rapid uptake by nearby astrocytes after θ-burst stimulation in layer ii/iii of cortical slices, a paradigm resulting in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. internalization of pro-bdnf occurs via the formation of a complex with the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 and subsequent clathrin-dependent endocytosis. fluorescence-tagged pro-bdnf and real-time total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cultured astrocytes is used to monitor single endocytic vesicles in response to the neurotransmitter glutamate. we find that endocytosed pro-bdnf is routed into a fast recycling pathway for subsequent soluble nsf attachment protein receptor–dependent secretion. thus, astrocytes contain an endocytic compartment competent for pro-bdnf recycling, suggesting a specialized form of bidirectional communication between neurons and glia.
@background randomized trial of different intraabdominal pressures and acid–base balance alterations during laparoscopic cholecystectomy controversy has been raised about the effects of systemic carbon dioxide accumulation versus the intra-abdominal pressure on hemodynamics during laparoscopy. we compared the acid-base and hemodynamic changes during pneumoperitoneum in a randomized cross-over study between co2 and nitrogen gases to test the hypothesis that the co2 absorbed during laparoscopy, rather than the 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure created, accounted for these changes. eight adult pigs were anesthetized and ventilated with a fixed minute ventilation. metabolic function was measured from analysis of expired flow by a metabolic measurement cart. after baseline periods, animals were randomized into two groups, for 2 hr of either co2 or nitrogen pneumoperitoneum at 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure, followed by 1 hr of recovery. after at least a 48-hr recovery period, the experiment was repeated with the other gas. metabolic data revealed that there was a significant absorption of co2 gas across the peritoneal epithelium during co2 pneumoperitoneum. animals insufflated with co2 gas experienced a 75% increase in pulmonary co2 excretion, with significant acidemia and hypercapnia, whereas there were no acid-base disturbances in those with nitrogen insufflation. oxygen consumption remained essentially unchanged in both groups, even during pneumoperitoneum. co2 pneumoperitoneum was also associated with systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension and a reduction in stroke volume of up to 15%. pneumoperitoneum alone did not compromise hemodynamics. pneumoperitoneum using co2 gas during laparoscopy resulted in systemic co2 absorption across the peritoneum. this led to acidemia, hypercapnea, and depressed hemodynamics. the intra-abdominal pressure routinely used during laparoscopic surgery did not affect metabolic function, acid-base balance, or hemodynamics in the experimental model.
@background antioxidant activities, phenols and flavonoid contents of curcuma longa l. and curcuma caesia roxb. found in manipur plant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and lignin precursors are important constituents of the human diet. these dietary phytophenolics have been recognized largely as beneficial antioxidants that can scavenge harmful active oxygen species including o(2)(.-), h(2)o(2), .oh, and (1)o(2). here we review our current understanding of the antioxidant and prooxidant actions of phenolics in plant cells. in plant systems, phytophenolics can act as antioxidants by donating electrons to guaiacol-type peroxidases (gupxs) for the detoxification of h(2)o(2) produced under stress conditions. as a result of such enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic antioxidant reactions, phenoxyl radicals are formed as the primary oxidized products. until recently, phenoxyl radicals had been difficult to detect by static electron spin resonance (esr) because they rapidly change to non-radical products. application of zn exerts spin-stabilizing effects on phenoxyl radicals that enables us to analyze the formation and decay kinetics of the radicals. the esr signals of phenoxyl radicals are eliminated by monodehydroascorbate radical (mda) reductase, suggesting that phenoxyl radicals, like the ascorbate radical, are enzymatically recycled to parent phenolics. thus, phenolics in plant cells can form an antioxidant system equivalent to that of ascorbate. in contrast to their antioxidant activity, phytophenolics also have the potential to act as prooxidants under certain conditions. for example, flavonoids and dihydroxycinnamic acids can nick dna via the production of radicals in the presence of cu and o(2). phenoxyl radicals can also initiate lipid peroxidation. recently, al, zn, ca, mg and cd have been found to stimulate phenoxyl radical-induced lipid peroxidation. we discuss the mechanism of phenoxyl radical prooxidant activity in terms of lifetime prolongation by spin-stabilizing agents.
@result comparative evaluation of six commercialized multiplex pcr kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections abstract    this study compares the performance of four commercial multiplex pcr assays (resplex ii panel v2.0, seeplex rv15, xtag rvp and xtag rvp fast) and direct fluorescent antibody (dfa) staining and viral isolation. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. in each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex pcr assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children. in addition, the sensitivity of two commercial assays, resplex ii plus pre and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping, was determined relative to the astra influenza screen & type assay for detection of influenza a viruses, including seasonal influenzas and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. using 75 positive and 55 negative nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza a by the astra assay, the sensitivity of seeplex and resplex was 95.9% and 91.8%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both.

@background protein phosphatase 2a forms a molecular complex with shc and regulates shc tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream mitogenic signaling we have reported that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) by expression of sv40 small t stimulates the mitogenic map kinase cascade. here, we show that sv40 small t can substitute for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) or serum and stimulate atypical protein kinase c zeta (pkc zeta) activity, resulting in mek activation, cell proliferation and nf-kappab-dependent gene transcriptional activation in cv-1 and nih 3t3 cells. these effects were abrogated by co-expression of kinase-deficient pkc zeta and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha-p110 by wortmannin, ly294002 and a dominant-negative mutant of p85alpha. in contrast, expression of kinase-inactive erk2 inhibited small t-dependent cell growth but was unable to abolish small t-induced nf-kappab transactivation. our results provide the first in vivo evidence for a critical regulatory role of pp2a in bifunctional pkc zeta signaling pathways controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. constitutive activation of pkc zeta and nf-kappab following inhibition of pp2a supports new mechanisms by which sv40 small t promotes cell growth and transformation. by establishing pp2a as a key player in the response of cells to growth factors and stress signals like tnf-alpha, our findings could explain why pp2a is a primary target utilized during sv40 infection to alter cellular behavior.
@background using ancestry matching to combine family-based and unrelated samples for genome-wide association studies. association studies using diseased cases and their parents avoid biases due to population stratification, and the transmission/disequilibrium test (tdt) is a popular method of analysis. sample size and power calculations for the tdt method have been reported, but often for the special situation of multiplicative effects of alleles on the genotype relative risks. furthermore, some of the proposed calculations ignore the dependence of transmitted alleles from a pair of heterozygous parents when the effects are not multiplicative, which can lead to erroneous sample size calculations. we demonstrate how to calculate sample size and power for the tdt method for general genotype relative risks. as an alternative to the tdt method, we present likelihood methods for a variety of genotype relative risk models. exact likelihood methods are presented to allow for accurate small‐sample analyses. we demonstrate by numerical comparisons: (1) that the tdt method is inefficient for recessive patterns of relative risks, (2) for alleles that are not rare, falsely assuming a multiplicative model can lead to gross underestimation of the required sample size for the tdt statistic, and (3) for common alleles, if the true genotype relative risks have an approximately dominant pattern, then the tdt method can be grossly inefficient compared to likelihood methods. an alternative likelihood ratio statistic, based on two degrees of freedom, tends to be robust for a wide range of genotype relative risk models. finally, we discuss how to use standard software for conditional logistic regression to accurately assess effects of alleles as well as genotype‐environment interaction. genet. epidemiol. 16:250–260, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background trafficking-deficient g572r-herg and e637k-herg activate stress and clearance pathways in endoplasmic reticulum a variety of quality control mechanisms operate in the endoplasmic reticulum and in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity and regulation of protein expression during cell life and differentiation. as a rule, only proteins that pass a stringent selection process are transported to their target organelles and compartments. if proper maturation fails, the aberrant products are degraded. quality control improves folding efficiency by retaining proteins in the special folding environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, and it prevents harmful effects that could be caused by the deployment of incompletely folded or assembled proteins.
@background identification of a novel myosin-va mutation in an ataxic mutant rat, dilute-opisthotonus the mouse dilute (d) locus encodes unconventional myosin-va (myova). mice carrying null alleles of dilute have a lightened coat color and die from a neurological disorder resembling ataxia and opisthotonus within three weeks of birth. immunological and ultrastructural studies suggest that myova is involved in the transport of melanosomes in melanocytes and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in cerebellar purkinje cells. in studies described here, we have used an rt-pcr-based sequencing approach to identify the mutations responsible for 17 viable dilute alleles that vary in their effects on coat color and the nervous system. seven of these mutations mapped to the myova motor domain and are reported here. crystallographic modeling and mutant expression studies were used to predict how these mutations might affect motor domain function and to attempt to correlate these effects with the mutant phenotype.
@background indirect effects of wnt3a/β-catenin signalling support mouse spermatogonial stem cells in vitro the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) provides the foundation for life-long spermatogenesis. although glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 are crucial for self-renewal of sscs, recent studies have suggested that other growth factors have important roles in controlling ssc fate. because β-catenin-dependent wnt signaling promotes self-renewal of various stem cell types, we hypothesized that this pathway contributes to ssc maintenance. using transgenic reporter mice for β-catenin-dependent signaling, we found that this signaling was not active in sscs in vitro and in most spermatogonia in vivo. nonetheless, a pan-wnt antagonist significantly reduced ssc activity in vitro, suggesting that some wnt molecules exist in our serum-free culture system and contribute to ssc maintenance. here, we report that wnt5a promotes ssc activity. we found that wnt5a-expressing fibroblasts supported ssc activity better than those not expressing wnt5a in culture, and that recombinant wnt5a stimulated ssc maintenance. furthermore, wnt5a promoted ssc survival in the absence of feeder cells, and this effect was abolished by inhibiting the jun n-terminal kinase cascade. in addition, wnt5a blocked β-catenin-dependent signaling. we detected the expression of wnt5a and potential wnt5a receptors in sertoli cells and stem/progenitor spermatogonia, respectively. these results indicate that wnt5a is a cell-extrinsic factor that supports ssc self-renewal through β-catenin-independent mechanisms.
@method the formation of proximal and distal definitive endoderm populations in culture requires p38 mapk activity transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf beta 1) is shown here to be required for yolk sac haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation. mice with a targeted mutation in the tgf beta 1 gene were examined to determine the cause of prenatal lethality, which occurs in 50% of homozygous tgf beta 1 null (tgf beta 1-/-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1-+-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1+/- conceptuses were found to die at around 10.5 dpc. the primary defects were restricted to extraembryonic tissues, namely the yolk sac vasculature and haematopoietic system. the embryos per se showed developmental retardation, oedema and necrosis, which were probably secondary to the extraembryonic lesions. the defect in vasculogenesis appeared to affect endothelial differentiation, rather than the initial appearance and outgrowth of endothelial cells. initial differentiation of yolk sac mesoderm to endothelial cells occurred, but defective differentiation resulted in inadequate capillary tube formation, and weak vessels with reduced cellular adhesiveness. defective haematopoiesis resulted in a reduced erythroid cell number within the yolk sac. defective yolk sac vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis were present either together, or in isolation of each other. the phenotypes are consistent with the observation of abundant tgf beta 1 gene expression in both endothelial and haematopoietic precursors. the data indicate that the primary effect of loss of tgf beta 1 function in vivo is not increased haematopoietic or endothelial cell proliferation, which might have been expected by deletion of a negative growth regulator, but defective haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation.
@background modified apolipoprotein (apo) a-i by artificial sweetener causes severe premature cellular senescence and atherosclerosis with impairment of functional and structural properties of apoa-i in lipid-free and lipid-bound state non-enzymatic glycation of serum apolipoproteins is a main feature of diabetes mellitus under hyperglycemia. advanced glycation end products are implicated in the development of aging and metabolic syndrome, including premature atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects. apoa-i is the principal protein constituent of hdl. in this study, glycated human apoa-i (ga-i) by fructation was characterized on functional and structural correlations in lipid-free and lipid-bound states. the ga-i showed more spontaneous multimeric band formation up to pentamer and exhibited slower elution profile with more degraded fragments from fast protein liquid chromatography. the ga-i showed modified secondary structure from fluorescence and circular dichroism analysis. reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rhdl) containing the ga-i had less content of phospholipid with a much smaller particle size than those of rhdl-containing na-i (na-i-rhdl). the rhdl containing ga-i (ga-i-rhdl) consisted of less molecular number of apoa-i than na-i-rhdl with decreased alpha-helical content. treatment of the ga-i-rhdl induced more atherogenic process in macrophage cell and premature senescence in human dermal fibroblast cell. conclusively, fructose-mediated apoa-i glycation resulted in severe loss of several beneficial functions of apoa-i and hdl regarding anti-senescence and anti-atherosclerosis activities due to a lack of anti-oxidant activity with increased susceptibility of protein degradation and structural modification.
@background bronchial reactivity to histamine is correlated with airway remodeling in adults with moderate to severe asthma airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are characteristic phenotypic features of asthma. clinically, airflow obstruction in asthma often is not fully reversible, and many asthmatic subjects experience an accelerated and progressive loss of lung function over time. histopathologic studies of the asthmatic airway have demonstrated stereotypic changes that might explain the loss of lung function that many patients with asthma experience. the notion of airway remodeling in asthma postulates that the alteration of the structure and function of key airway constituents, including airway smooth muscle, epithelium, blood vessels, and mucus glands, might explain, at least in part, the progressive loss of lung function that is observed clinically. inflammation driven by cd4(+) lymphocytes and mediated by effector cells, particularly the eosinophil, appears to modulate the function of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, changing the composition of the airway wall matrix. changes in the airway epithelium might alter the function of the underlying smooth muscle and the composition of the matrix and could drive inflammation. alterations in the structure and function of airway smooth muscle change the mechanical properties of the airway wall and might also affect the function of other airway constituents. a variety of experimental models have identified candidate mechanisms and mediators for these observed changes, which are thus potential therapeutic targets. however, clinical studies to date have been disappointing, and it remains to be seen whether targeted therapies will prevent the progressive loss of lung function seen in asthma.
@background prominent crista terminalis and eustachian ridge in the right atrium: two dimensional (2d) and three dimensional (3d) imaging. we evaluated the diagnostic use of a real-time 3-dimensional (3d) echocardiographic system in 106 patients referred for echocardiography during a 4-month period. real-time 3d echocardiography was performed and recorded in parallel with a routine, comprehensive 2-dimensional (2d) study. the diagnoses were exclusively on the basis of 2d findings. the 3d volumes were sliced offline in the 3 dimensions to selectively display specific cardiac structures and reviewed independent of the 2d findings. the 3d studies were graded as: a, new finding not on 2d studies; b, useful anatomic perspective; c, equivalent to 2d studies; or d, missed 2d findings. compared with 2d echocardiography, 3d echocardiography was graded a in 7 (7%), b in 19 (18%), c in 65 (61%), and d in 15 (14%) cases. in the 26 grade-a and grade-b studies, mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease accounted for 16 (61%) cases. suboptimal image quality was present in 7 (47%) of the 15 grade-d studies. thus, real-time 3d echocardiography yields anatomic information comparable with conventional 2d echocardiography in the majority of patients. it can provide new and useful anatomic insight, particularly in patients with mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease. suboptimal image quality remains a problem for real-time 3d echocardiography in some patients.

@background evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
@background can translocated native fishes retain their trophic niche when confronted with a resident invasive background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.
@method prevalence and ethnic/racial disparities in the distribution of pediatric injuries in south florida: implications for the development of community prevention programs the injury severity score (5) (iss) is a scalar (single number) measure of anatomic injury, widely used in and an important contribution to trauma research. the iss is the sum of squares of the highest abbreviated injury scale (1-3) (ais) grade in each of the three most severely injured body regions. thus the iss is a summary measure of trauma to single or multiple body regions. per cent mortality for blunt injured patients has been shown to be related to iss (based on ais-76) and patient age (4-6). patients used to establish those relationships were treated in 1961 and 1967-1968. similar relationships for penetrating injuries have not been prepared because, until the 1985 version, the ais provided severity grades for blunt injuries only. the iss is frequently used to assess or compare the injury severity of patient populations (7, 10, 13, 16) and as the anatomic component of trauma patient characterizations used in evaluation of care and quality assurance methods (8). the ais first published in 1971, was developed to classify anatomic injury from motor vehicle-related trauma. it has been revised and broadened in scope in 1976, 1980, and 1985. changes in injury coding, trauma care delivery, and clinical management mandate the updating of relationships between severity measures and mortality from which conclusions regarding patient management or healthcare policy issues may be drawn. the present study uses the most recent ais version (ais-85) to derive relationships between mortality rate and the iss for comtemporary patients with blunt or penetrating injuries and identifies important properties of the iss which should be considered when the measure is used to compare case mix severity in different populations.(author/trrl)
@method an amino acids mixture attenuates glycemic impairment but not affects adiposity development in rats fed with ages-containing diet soleus muscles isolated from normal rats were incubated to evaluate whether or not leucine promotes glucose uptake under insulin-free conditions, using a labeled 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay. glucose uptake was promoted by 2mm leucine. a metabolite of leucine, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (alpha-kic), also exhibited a similar stimulatory effect, although this was not as potent as leucine. stimulation of glucose uptake by leucine was completely canceled by pre-treatment with either 10 microm ly294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase), or 6 microm gf109203x, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase c (pkc). no significant change was observed by pre-treatment with 1 microm rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor). these results suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle via pi3-kinase and pkc pathways independently of the mammalian target of mtor. they also suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport by an insulin-independent mechanism.

@background provision of breast cancer care and survival in germany – results from a population-based high resolution study from saarland evidence suggests that compared to younger women, older women are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer. whether this disparity persists once differences in tumour characteristics have been adjusted for has not been investigated in the uk. a retrospective cohort study involving case note review was undertaken, based on the north western cancer registry database of women aged ⩾65 years, resident in greater manchester with invasive breast cancer registered over a 1-year period (n=480). adjusting for tumour characteristics associated with age by logistic regression analyses, older women were less likely to receive standard management than younger women for all indicators investigated. compared to women aged 65–69 years, women aged ⩾80 years with operable (stage 1–3a) breast cancer have increased odds of not receiving triple assessment (or=5.5, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.1–14.5), not receiving primary surgery (or=43.0, 95% ci: 9.7–191.3), not undergoing axillary node surgery (or=27.6, 95% ci: 5.6–135.9) and not undergoing tests for steroid receptors (or=3.0, 95% ci: 1.7–5.5). women aged 75–79 years have increased odds of not receiving radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery compared to women aged 65–69 years (or=11.0, 95% ci: 2.0–61.6). these results demonstrate that older women in the uk are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer, compared to younger women and this disparity cannot be explained by differences in tumour characteristics.

@result health-related quality of life, psychosocial strains, and coping in parents of children with chronic renal failure families with a child on chronic peritoneal dialysis have to assume a significant burden of care, intensifying the demands and the reorganization of roles in the families of children. the purpose of this study is to describe the implications of role changes in families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. this is a case study of four families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. fourteen family members participate in the study. after the child's chronic kidney failure and the start of treatment, each relative's ways, acts and functions are changed, maintained or adapted to the new family dynamics, imposed by the child's treatment conditions. appropriate role assessment provides the nurse and the families of children with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis with insight regarding current and potential health problems and aids in identifying the needs of the families.
@background discovery of dual-action membrane-anchored modulators of incretin receptors g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) represent the largest constellation of validated drug targets. crystal structures of class a gpcrs have facilitated major advances in understanding the principles underlying gpcr activation. by contrast, relatively little is known about class b gpcrs, a family of receptors for a variety of therapeutically relevant peptide hormones. encouraging progress has recently been made through the structural elucidation of several extracellular hormone-binding domains of class b gpcrs in complex with their natural ligands or synthetic analogues. the structures reveal similar modes of ligand binding, with concomitant alpha-helical structuring of the ligand. the latter suggests an attractive mechanical model for class b gpcr activation.
@result skeletal alterations associated with the use of bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. objective to evaluate the long-term effects of rapid maxillary expansion (rme) via banded expanders in the sagittal and vertical facial planes.   materials and methods the sample consisted of 25 patients who had undergone rme (with either haas-type or hyrax hygienic expanders) followed by standard edgewise orthodontic therapy. this sample was compared with a group of 25 patients who had edgewise treatment only and with a control nontreatment group of 26 subjects, matched by age and gender with the patients of the other two groups. lateral cephalograms were taken before treatment (t1), at the end of treatment (t2), and at 3 years posttreatment (t3), comprising a 5-year average time of observation.   results rme treatment, in the long-term, did not influence the sagittal position of the apical jaw bases or the facial vertical dimension.   conclusion unfavorable cephalometric changes resulting immediately after rme are temporary, and therefore concerns about using rme in patients with vertical growth patterns or an extremely convex facial profile are not substantiated.
@background cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability in the rat gracilis dorsal column nucleus the functional properties, ionic basis, and possible convergence and interaction of postsynaptic actions mediated by muscarinic and alpha 1- adrenergic receptors were examined in cat and guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate (lgnd) neurons maintained in thalamic slices in vitro. the possible involvement of gtp-binding proteins was also examined. extracellular recordings from cat lgnd revealed the presence of two subpopulations of neurons. the most prevalent generated rhythmic high- frequency (300–500 hz) bursts of two to six action potentials each, with an interburst frequency of 1–3 hz. intracellular recordings revealed that this activity is typical of thalamocortical relay cells in the apparent absence of neuromodulatory input. application of ach or noradrenaline (na) to rhythmically oscillating neurons in the cat lgnd resulted in cessation of this activity followed by the appearance of single spike firing. intracellular recordings revealed that this change in firing mode was associated with a depolarization of the neuron out of the range of intrinsic rhythmic oscillation and into or near the single spike firing mode. the voltage characteristics of the current underlying the cholinergic and noradrenergic slow depolarization were investigated in guinea pig lgnd neurons. application of the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine (mch) to presumed relay neurons resulted in a hyperpolarization due to the activation of an outward k+ current. this response was followed by a slow depolarization due to reduction of a relatively non-voltage-dependent potassium current distinct from im and iahp. application of na resulted in a slow depolarization that was also associated with reduction of this relatively linear k+ current. the mch- and na-induced slow depolarizations displayed the property of occlusion, indicating convergence of action. however, these responses were mediated by pharmacologically distinct receptors since the mch-induced reduction in k+ current was blocked by scopolamine while that induced by na was blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. intracellular diffusion of gtp-gamma-s resulted in the inward current responses to na and mch being irreversible, suggesting the possible involvement of a g- protein. prior exposure to pertussis toxin did not affect the inward current response to na and mch, while the outward k+ current responses induced by application of mch or the gabab agonist baclofen were blocked. these results reveal that activation of muscarinic or alpha 1- adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the lgnd result in a shift in firing mode from rhythmic oscillation to tonic single spike activity through a decrease in a relatively linear k+ current mediated through a pertussis toxin-insensitive g-protein.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
@method conceptual metaphor, human-computer interaction and music : applying conceptual metaphor to the design and analysis of music interactions tangible interaction research has opened up new ways to interact with computers and extended our imagination of what is possible with digital systems. however, research on tangible user interfaces (tui) seems to have lost sight of the everyday situation of the majority of people who still work with standard computer systems. this paper investigates a design process for applying tui in a gui dominated domain while preserving the functionality of the traditional systems. we exemplify a user centered design process using (1) image schemas as a meta-language for analysis and design and (2) a systematic function allocation of digital and physical user interface elements. we demonstrate this process in the context of the redesign of an invoice verification and posting system of a german beverage company.
@result chronic psychosocial stress: does it modulate immunity to the influenza vaccine in hong kong chinese elderly caregivers? to determine whether a chronic stressor (caregiving for a spouse with a progressive dementia) is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza virus vaccination, we compared 32 caregivers' vaccine responses with those of 32 sex-, age-, and socioeconomically matched control subjects. caregivers showed a poorer antibody response following vaccination relative to control subjects as assessed by two independent methods, elisa and hemagglutination inhibition. caregivers also had lower levels of in vitro virus-specific-induced interleukin 2 levels and interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6 did not differ between groups. these data demonstrate that down-regulation of the immune response to influenza virus vaccination is associated with a chronic stressor in the elderly. these results could have implications for vulnerability to infection among older adults.
@result effect of fluid intake on renal function during exercise in the cold plasma volume (pv), protein, and electrolyte shifts were measured in two groups of five men in the supine position during rest, exercise (40-47% vo2max), and recovery in cool (ta = 26.5 degrees c) and hot (ta = 39.4 degrees c) environments. they drank 16-17 ml/kg hypertonic (1.5%) nacl, isotonic (0.9%) nacl, or hypertonic (1.5%) calcium gluconate solutions during the preexercise rest period. hyper-na consumption retarded the rise in pv (hypervolemia) at rest in the cool but not in the heat. ingestion of iso-na and hyper-na resulted in twofold greater hypervolemia at rest in the heat. during exercise and recovery, pv was highest with hyper-na in the heat. hyper-ca prevented the normal hypervolemic response at rest in both environments. the normal hypervolemic responses during exercise were not influenced by any drink composition. the results suggest hypertonic drinks may be better for maintaining pv levels during exercise in heat; but calcium must be used with care.
@method modeling photographic composition via triangles we present an algorithm that quickly and accurately estimates vanishing points in images of man-made environments. contrary to previously proposed solutions, ours is neither iterative nor relies on voting in the space of vanishing points. our formulation is based on a recently proposed algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of multiple models called j-linkage. our method avoids representing edges on the gaussian sphere and the computations and error measures are done in the image. we show that a consistency measure between a vanishing point and an edge of the image can be computed in closed-form while being geometrically meaningful. finally, given a set of estimated vanishing points, we show how this consistency measure can be used to identify the three vanishing points corresponding to the manhattan directions. we compare our algorithm with other approaches on the york urban database and show significant performance improvements.
@method exploring scale-induced feature hierarchies in natural images this paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. the features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3d viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. the features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. this paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. the recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. this approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.
@method intra-individual changes in dna methylation not mediated by cell-type composition are correlated with aging during childhood the central importance of epigenetics to the aging process is increasingly being recognized. here we perform a methylome-wide association study (mwas) of aging in whole blood dna from 718 individuals, aged 25-92 years (mean = 55). we sequenced the methyl-cpg-enriched genomic dna fraction, averaging 67.3 million reads per subject, to obtain methylation measurements for the ∼27 million autosomal cpgs in the human genome. following extensive quality control, we adaptively combined methylation measures for neighboring, highly-correlated cpgs into 4 344 016 cpg blocks with which we performed association testing. eleven age-associated differentially methylated regions (dmrs) passed bonferroni correction (p-value < 1.15 × 10(-8)). top findings replicated in an independent sample set of 558 subjects using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted dna (min p-value < 10(-30)). to examine biological themes, we selected 70 dmrs with false discovery rate of <0.1. of these, 42 showed hypomethylation and 28 showed hypermethylation with age. hypermethylated dmrs were more likely to overlap with cpg islands and shores. hypomethylated dmrs were more likely to be in regions associated with polycomb/regulatory proteins (e.g. ezh2) or histone modifications h3k27ac, h3k4m1, h3k4m2, h3k4m3 and h3k9ac. among genes implicated by the top dmrs were protocadherins, homeobox genes, mapks and ryanodine receptors. several of our dmrs are at genes with potential relevance for age-related disease. this study successfully demonstrates the application of next-generation sequencing to mwas, by interrogating a large proportion of the methylome and returning potentially novel age dmrs, in addition to replicating several loci implicated in previous studies using microarrays.
@background alterations in somatostatin mrna expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. background markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) neurotransmission seem to be altered in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) of subjects with schizophrenia. we sought to determine whether the expression of the messenger rna (mrna) for the synthesizing enzyme of gaba, glutamic acid decarboxylase67 (gad67), is decreased in the pfc of subjects with schizophrenia, whether this change is present in all or only some gaba neurons, and whether long-term treatment with haloperidol decanoate contributes to altered gad67 mrna expression.   methods tissue sections from 10 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects and 4 pairs of haloperidol-treated and control monkeys were processed for in situ hybridization histochemical analysis with sulfur-35-labeled oligonucleotide probes for gad67 mrna and exposed to nuclear emulsion. within each layer of pfc area 9, neurons expressing a detectable level of gad67 mrna were quantified for cell density and the relative level of mrna expression per cell (grain density per neuron).   results in subjects with schizophrenia, the density of labeled neurons was significantly (p<.05) decreased by 25% to 35% in cortical layers 3 to 5. in contrast, the mean grain density per labeled neuron did not differ across subject groups. similar analyses in monkeys revealed no effect of long-term haloperidol treatment on either the density of the labeled neurons or the grain density per labeled neuron.   conclusions these findings indicate that in subjects with schizophrenia, gad67 mrna expression is relatively unaltered in most pfc gaba neurons but is reduced below a detectable level in a subset of gaba neurons. altered gaba neurotransmission in this subset may contribute to pfc dysfunction in subjects with schizophrenia.
@method relation between parent psychiatric symptoms and youth problems: moderation through family structure and youth gender context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
@result general practitioners' coronary risk estimates, decisions to start lipid-lowering treatment, gender and length of clinical experience: their interactions in primary prevention. the tenets of fuzzy trace theory are summarized with respect to their relevance to health and medical decision making. illustrations are given for hiv prevention, cardiovascular disease, surgical risk, genetic risk, and cancer prevention and control. a core idea of fuzzy trace theory is that people rely on the gist of information, its bottom-line meaning, as opposed to verbatim details in judgment and decision making. this idea explains why precise information (e.g., about risk) is not necessarily effective in encouraging prevention behaviors or in supporting medical decision making. people can get the facts right, and still not derive the proper meaning, which is key to informed decision making. getting the gist is not sufficient, however. retrieval (e.g., of health-related values) and processing interference brought on by thinking about nested or overlapping classes (e.g., in ratio concepts, such as probability) are also important. theory-based interventions that work (and why they work) are presented, ranging from specific techniques aimed at enhancing representation, retrieval, and processing to a comprehensive intervention that integrates these components.
@result a serological and molecular survey of hepatitis b in children 15 years after inception of the national hepatitis b vaccination program in eastern china the long-term efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination among high-risk infants was determined in 805 vaccine responders, immunized at birth in taiwan during 1981-1984 and followed to age 10 years, via life table survival and cox multivariate analyses. at 10 years, cumulative persistence of antibody to hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) was 85%, and cumulative incidence of hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection was 15%. three children became carriers. twelve-month anti-hbs titer was the strongest predictor of efficacy. the higher the initial titer, the lower the risk of anti-hbs loss (relative risk [rr], 0.26 for titer of 100-999 miu/ml; rr, 0.08 for titer >1000 miu/ml; p<.001) and hbv infection (rr, 0.55 and 0.27; p<.05). maternal hepatitis b e antigen positivity but not hepatitis b immunoglobulin dose or gender predicted greater antibody persistence to age 10 years. because the level of antibody persistence remained high and few became carriers, booster revaccination within 10 years seems unnecessary.
@method a geometrical model of vertical translation and alar ligament tension in atlanto-axial rotation rheumatoid arthritis frequently contributes to instability of the upper cervical spine. rotational instability of the upper cervical spine was evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis patients using biplanar x-ray photogrammetry. three-dimensional cervical motion and the instantaneous axis of rotation of the atlas relative to the axis were evaluated in normal and rheumatoid arthritis patients during axial rotation in the horizontal plane. anterior atlantoaxial subluxation did not increase during axial head rotation in either the atlantoaxial subluxation or the vertical subluxation groups, while the instantaneous axes of rotation were distributed posteriorly in the dens in the ra-normal group, but were widely scattered in the atlantoaxial subluxation group.
@method sustained activation of the her1-erk1/2-rsk signaling pathway controls myoepithelial cell fate in human mammary tissue. hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) and egf have been reported to promote branching morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells. we now show that it is epimorphin that is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. in vivo, epimorphin was detected in the stromal compartment but not in lumenal epithelial cells of the mammary gland; in culture, however, a subpopulation of mammary epithelial cells produced significant amounts of epimorphin. when epimorphin-expressing epithelial cell clones were cultured in collagen gels they displayed branching morphogenesis in the presence of hgf, egf, keratinocyte growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, a process that was inhibited by anti-epimorphin but not anti-hgf antibodies. the branch length, however, was roughly proportional to the ability of the factors to induce growth. accordingly, epimorphin-negative epithelial cells simply grew in a cluster in response to the growth factors and failed to branch. when recombinant epimorphin was added to these collagen gels, epimorphin-negative cells underwent branching morphogenesis. the mode of action of epimorphin on morphogenesis of the gland, however, was dependent on how it was presented to the mammary cells. if epimorphin was overexpressed in epimorphin-negative epithelial cells under regulation of an inducible promoter or was allowed to coat the surface of each epithelial cell in a nonpolar fashion, the cells formed globular, alveoli-like structures with a large central lumen instead of branching ducts. this process was enhanced also by addition of hgf, egf, or other growth factors and was inhibited by epimorphin antibodies. these results suggest that epimorphin is the primary morphogen in the mammary gland but that growth factors are necessary to achieve the appropriate cell numbers for the resulting morphogenesis to be visualized.
@method transcriptome characteristics and x-chromosome inactivation status in cultured rat pluripotent stem cells. rats have important advantages over mice as an experimental system for physiological and pharmacological investigations. the lack of rat embryonic stem (es) cells has restricted the availability of transgenic technologies to create genetic models in this species. here, we show that rat es cells can be efficiently derived, propagated, and genetically manipulated in the presence of small molecules that specifically inhibit gsk3, mek, and fgf receptor tyrosine kinases. these rat es cells express pluripotency markers and retain the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. most importantly, they can produce high rates of chimerism when reintroduced into early stage embryos and can transmit through the germline. establishment of authentic rat es cells will make possible sophisticated genetic manipulation to create models for the study of human diseases.
@background nonsynonymous polymorphisms of the pdlim5 gene association with the occurrence of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia single-point mutation in genome, for example, single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) or rare genetic mutation, is the change of a single nucleotide for another in the genome sequence. some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. this paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. the existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. it is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. the paper provides several examples of the application of 3d structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.
@result protein markers and seed size variation in common bean segregating populations neutral detergent fiber (ndf) is considered the laboratory measure most closely correlated with voluntary intake of forages by ruminant livestock. the objectives of this study were to create smooth bromegrass (bromus inermis leyss.) populations divergent for ndf concentration in four smooth bromegrass germplasm pools and to identify random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) marker changes in these divergently selected populations. two cycles of divergent phenotypic selection led to significant linear responses in ndf among selection cycles for all germplasm pools. within-population variation for rapd markers was large, reflecting the outcrossing reproduction and the complex inheritance of smooth bromegrass. however, analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differences among selected populations. analysis of genetic distances showed that each cycle of selection created additional divergence, both among cycles and among germplasm pools. up to 15 rapd markers were associated with selection in each population, but only one marker was consistently associated with selection for ndf across all four germplasm pools (linear, homogeneous slopes, no drift). some of the rapd markers appear to have utility for marker selection or marker-assisted selection (mas) to modify ndf concentration.
@method novel mutations in ribosomal proteins l4 and l22 that confer erythromycin resistance in escherichia coli using lacl-z fusion strains of escherichia coli we have devised systems that detect deletions of varying lengths. we examined deletions 700-1000 base pairs long, and genetically characterized over 250 spontaneous deletions. of these, we analyzed 24 by direct dna sequencing and 18 by inspection of restriction fragment patterns. deletions of this size occur almost exclusively at short repeated sequences in both (reca+ and reca- strain backgrounds, but are detected 25-fold more frequently in a reca+ background. the frequency of deletion formation correlates with the extent of homology between the short repeated sequences, although other factors may be involved. the largest hotspot, which accounts for 60% of the deletions detected, involves the largest homology in the system (14 of 17 base pairs). altering a single base pair within this homology reduces deletion incidence by an order of magnitude. we discuss possible mechanisms of deletion formation and consider its relationship to the excision of transposable elements.
@background a global perspective on last glacial maximum to holocene climate change a sediment core from the western tropical atlantic covering the last 21,000 yr has been analysed for centennial scale reconstruction of sea surface temperature (sst) and ice volume-corrected oxygen isotopic composition of sea water (delta(18)o(ivc-sw)) using mg/ca and delta(18)o of the shallow dwelling planktonic foraminifer globigerinoides ruber (white). at a period between 15.5 and 17.5 kyrbp, the mg/ca sstand delta(18)o(ivc-sw), a proxy for sea surface salinity (sss), reveals a warming of around 2.5 degrees c along with all increase in salinity. a second period of pronounced warming and sss increase occurred between 11.6 and 13.5 kyr bp. within age model uncertainties, both warming intervals were synchronous with air temperature increase over antarctica and ice retreat in the southern south atlantic and terminated with abrupt centennial scale sss decrease and slight sst cooling in conjunction with interglacial reactivation of the meridional overturning circulation (moc). we suggest that during these warm intervals, production of saline and warm water of the north brazil current resulted in pronounced heat and salt accumulation, and was associated with warming in the southern atlantic, southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone and weakened moc. at the termination of the younger dryas and heinrich event 1, intensification of cross-equatorial heat and salt transport caused centennial scale cooling and freshening of the western tropical atlantic surface water. this study shows that the western tropical atlantic served as a heat and salt reservoir during deglaciation. the sudden release of accumulated heat and salt at the end of younger drays and heinrich event 1 may have contributed to the rapid reinvigoration of the atlantic moc.

@background precision and reliability in animal navigation many animals regularly return to particular locations such as hives, nests, wintering grounds or cache sites. this ability clearly implies that animals possess information that allows them to find a route from their current location to their goal. however, the nature of this information is, in many cases, unknown. one particularly important issue is whether this information encodes at least some of the geometric relationships among real-world objects, which would meet a strict definition of a cognitive map. are animals sensitive to such geometric relationships? although there is clear evidence that animals can learn vectors that represent a goal location in terms of absolute distance and direction to a landmark, there is little evidence of any ability to extract abstract geometric rules. here we report data demonstrating that the corvid clark's nutcracker (nucifraga columbiana) can learn to find the point halfway between two landmarks that vary in the distance that separates them. this learning is based on a general principle, as the birds correctly find the halfway point when the landmarks are presented with new distances between them. this demonstrates the ability to find a point defined not by the relationship between a goal and a landmark but by the relationship between landmarks. further experiments demonstrate that there were two distinct processes involved in locating the halfway point, the use of directional bearings to find the (hypothetical) line connecting the landmarks and finding the correct place along that line.
@method mipstr: a method for multiplex genotyping of germline and somatic str variation across many individuals. motivation in the past few years, human genome structural variation discovery has enjoyed increased attention from the genomics research community. many studies were published to characterize short insertions, deletions, duplications and inversions, and associate copy number variants (cnvs) with disease. detection of new sequence insertions requires sequence data, however, the 'detectable' sequence length with read-pair analysis is limited by the insert size. thus, longer sequence insertions that contribute to our genetic makeup are not extensively researched.   results we present novelseq: a computational framework to discover the content and location of long novel sequence insertions using paired-end sequencing data generated by the next-generation sequencing platforms. our framework can be built as part of a general sequence analysis pipeline to discover multiple types of genetic variation (snps, structural variation, etc.), thus it requires significantly less-computational resources than de novo sequence assembly. we apply our methods to detect novel sequence insertions in the genome of an anonymous donor and validate our results by comparing with the insertions discovered in the same genome using various sources of sequence data.   availability the implementation of the novelseq pipeline is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/strvar.htm   contact eee@gs.washington.edu; cenk@cs.sfu.ca

@method development of a standardized screening rule for tuberculosis in people living with hiv in resource-constrained settings: individual participant data meta-analysis of observational studies rationale gold miners in south africa undergo annual radiological screening for tuberculosis in an occupational health center of a gold mining company, but the optimal screening algorithm is unclear.   objectives to evaluate methods for active case detection of tuberculosis.   methods a sequential sample of miners attending annual medical examination was screened for tuberculosis using a symptom questionnaire, chest radiograph, and two sputum specimens for microscopy and culture.   measurements and main results there were 1,955 miners included in this study; all were male with a median age of 41 years (range, 20-61 yr). presence of at least one of a trio of symptoms (new or worsening cough, night sweats, or weight loss) had similar sensitivity (29.4%) to either chest radiograph (25.5%) or sputum smear (25.5%). these sensitivities did not differ by hiv status. presence of one or more elements of the symptom trio and/or new radiological abnormality substantially increased sensitivity to 49.0%. specificity of the symptom trio was higher in hiv-uninfected (91.8%) than in hiv-infected persons (88.2%; p = 0.018). specificity of chest radiography and smear were similar (98.7% and 99.0%, respectively) and did not differ by hiv status (both p values > 0.8).   conclusions in a population of gold miners who undergo regular radiological screening, the addition of chest radiography to symptom screening substantially improved the sensitivity and positive predictive value. hiv infection did not alter the sensitivity of the screening tool.
@background global assessment of host cell functions involved in the intracellular survival and replication of chlamydia using rna interference in human cells glucocorticoid-induced tnfr (gitr) has been implicated as an essential regulator of immune responses to self tissues and pathogens. we have recently shown that gitr-induced cellular events promote survival of naive t cells, but are insufficient to protect against activation-induced cell death. however, the molecular mechanisms of gitr-induced signal transduction that influence physiologic and pathologic immune responses are not well understood. tnfr-associated factors (trafs) are pivotal adapter proteins involved in signal transduction pathways of tnfr-related proteins. yeast two-hybrid assays and studies in hek293 cells and primary lymphocytes indicated interactions between traf2 and gitr mediated by acidic residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. gitr-induced activation of nf-κb is blocked by a20, an nf-κb-inducible protein that interacts with trafs and functions in a negative feedback mechanism downstream of other tnfrs. interestingly, in contrast with its effects on signaling triggered by other tnfrs, our functional studies revealed that traf2 plays a novel inhibitory role in gitr-triggered nf-κb activation.
@result age-related changes of serum mitochondrial uncoupling 1, rumen and rectal temperature in goats. the uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) is an indicator of brown adipocytes and is involved in the control of body temperature and regulation of energy balance. it abundantly expresses in newborns and has important functions in adults. however, little information was known on ucp1 gene expression in young and adolescent sheep. in this study, we cloned and identified the full-length dna and cdna sequences of the ovine ucp1 gene, which were 6659 bp and 1621 bp, respectively, and predicted the location of the gene on chromosome 17. forty-eight animals with an equal number of males and females each for both guangling large tail sheep (glt) and small tail sheep han (sth) sheep were used to study the ontogenetic expression of ucp1 mrna in eight adipose tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the results showed that the mrna was expressed in all tissues studied and at all stages from 2 to 12 months of age. nevertheless, the mrna in perirenal fat was expressed significantly higher than that in other tissues and lower in superficial fat than in deep deposits. the highest expression was observed in animals at 2 months of age and then decreased gradually with age. global expression in glt was significantly higher than that in sth. interactions between tissue and breed and age also influenced the mrna expression significantly. in addition, the mrna expression was associated with the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) haplotypes detected in the cdna of the gene.
@method the road to heaven is paved with effort: perceived effort amplifies moral judgment. people and societies seek to combat harmful events. however, because resources are limited, every wrong righted leaves another wrong left unchecked. responses must therefore be calibrated to the magnitude of the harm. one underappreciated factor that affects this calibration may be people’s oversensitivity to intent. across a series of studies, people saw intended harms as worse than unintended harms, even though the two harms were identical. this harm-magnification effect occurred for both subjective and monetary estimates of harm, and it remained when participants were given incentives to be accurate. the effect was fully mediated by blame motivation. people may therefore focus on intentional harms to the neglect of unintentional (but equally damaging) harms.
@method chronic pain assessments in children and adolescents: a systematic literature review of the selection, administration, interpretation, and reporting of unidimensional pain intensity scales unlabelled a number of adolescents with chronic pain have clinically significant disability across physical, social, and academic activities, and pain severity only explains a portion of the variance in functioning. thus, it is important to identify therapeutic options to improve adolescents' functioning. in contrast to studies with adults with chronic pain, research in pediatric pain has not consistently found anxiety to be a good predictor of pain-related disability. the present study evaluated pain, anxiety, and functioning in 222 adolescents with chronic pain. results indicated that pain was consistently and linearly related to disability across measures of physical and social functioning, school attendance, and physician visits. the relation between anxiety and functioning was complex; increased anxiety was related to poorer physical and social functioning and was related to fewer physician visits, although it was not associated with school attendance. additional analyses revealed that anxiety serves to moderate the relation between pain and functioning. specifically, at high anxiety, pain was not related to functioning, but at low anxiety, pain consistently predicted disability. in other words, highly anxious adolescents were functioning poorly regardless of the level of pain. the moderating role of anxiety highlights a number of research and clinical possibilities to explore with adolescents with chronic pain-related disability.   perspective data suggest that high anxiety is associated with poor functioning irrespective of pain intensity. at low anxiety, higher pain predicted greater disability. anxiety is important to assess when investigating potential reasons for pain-related disability.
@background learning and memory deficits consequent to reduction of the fragile x mental retardation protein result from metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated inhibition of camp signaling in drosophila this study was designed to further assess cognitive and affective functioning in a mouse model of fragile x syndrome (fxs), the fmr1(tm1cgr) or fmr1 "knockout" (ko) mouse. male ko mice and wild-type littermate controls were tested on learning set and reversal learning tasks. the ko mice were not impaired in associative learning, transfer of learning, or reversal learning, based on measures of learning rate. analyses of videotapes of the reversal learning task revealed that both groups of mice exhibited higher levels of activity and wall-climbing during the initial sessions of the task than during the final sessions, a pattern also seen for trials following an error relative to those following a correct response. notably, the increase in both behavioral measures seen early in the task was significantly more pronounced for the ko mice than for controls, as was the error-induced increase in activity level. this pattern of effects suggests that the ko mice reacted more strongly than controls to the reversal of contingencies and pronounced drop in reinforcement rate, and to errors in general. this pattern of effects is consistent with the heightened emotional reactivity frequently described for humans with fxs.
@result unfavorable anatomical factors influencing the success of retrograde intrarenal surgery for lower pole renal calculi. purpose percutaneous nephrolithotomy has been the standard of care for intrarenal calculi greater than 2 cm. flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy is a minimally invasive treatment modality that is able to treat large intrarenal calculi with the potential to decrease morbidity, while maintaining a high level of efficacy.   materials and methods a total of 15 patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater were treated with retrograde ureteroscopic nephrolithotripsy. lithotripsy was performed with a 7.2fr flexible ureteroscope and 200 micron laser fiber. the stone-free rate was defined as the absence of any stones in the kidney or residual stone fragments less than 1 mm, which is too small to be extracted with a basket or a grasper. all patients underwent followup ureteroscopy within 15 days after the last procedure and renal ultrasound 30 days after the last treatment.   results there were a total of 15 intrarenal calculi 20 to 25 mm (mean 22) in diameter. the mean number of procedures was 2.3 (range 2 to 4). the overall stone-free rate was 93.3%. one patient (6.6%) had a residual 5 mm stone fragment in the lower pole of the kidney, which was followed expectantly for 2 years with no change in size. there were no major complications. there were 3 minor complications (20%), including 1 emergency room visit for fever and pain, and 2 cases of gross hematuria. all cases were performed on an outpatient basis.   conclusions in select patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater small diameter flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy may represent an alternative therapy to standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy with acceptable efficacy and low morbidity.

@result cost-effectiveness analysis of the available pneumococcal conjugated vaccines for children under five years in colombia background heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) was licensed to provide immunity against pneumococcal disease caused by seven serotypes of s. pneumoniae. thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-13) includes 6 additional serotypes for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.   objective the objective of this study was to estimate the potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with pcv-13 in the community of valencia and to generate valuable information for policy makers at regional and country levels.   methods a decision tree was designed to determine the health and economic outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children followed over their lifetime. information about disease incidence and serotype distribution were gathered from local databases and from published and unpublished local records. pcv-13 effectiveness was extrapolated from pcv-7 efficacy data. a 5% of herd effect and a serotype replacement of 25% were considered for the base case scenario. only direct costs were taken into account and results were expressed in terms of life-years gained (lyg) and quality adjusted life years (qaly).   results implementing a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would decrease the number of hospital admitted pneumonia to less than 4571 cases while avoiding 310 cases of ipd and 82,596 cases of aom throughout the cohort lifetime. a total of 190 s. pneumoniae related deaths would be averted over the same period. total medical costs of non-vaccinating the cohort of newborns would reach up to 403,850.859€ compared to 438,762.712€ that would represent vaccinating the cohort. the incremental cost of vaccinating the children was estimated in 12,794€/lyg and 10,407€/qaly, respectively.   conclusions a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would be a cost-effective intervention from the payer perspective after preventing for pneumococcal infections and for decreasing its associated mortality and morbidity.

@background feasibility and relevance of level i substation node counts in oropharyngeal carcinoma a retrospective review of 333 previously untreated patients from 1965 to 1986, with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of neck node metastases by neck level. the 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the no neck (n = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the n+ neck (n = 259). detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. this revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels ii, iii, and iv for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. isolated “skip” metastases outside of levels ii, iii, or iv occurred in only 1 patient (0.3%). otherwise, level i or v involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, n2 disease). these data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in no patients. furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.
@result cannabinoids inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway in gliomas vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a key regulator of physiological angiogenesis during embryogenesis, skeletal growth and reproductive functions. vegf has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors, intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. the biological effects of vegf are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), vegfr-1 and vegfr-2, which differ considerably in signaling properties. non-signaling co-receptors also modulate vegf rtk signaling. currently, several vegf inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. vegf inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis, vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.
@result constrained action selection in children with developmental coordination disorder. response times generally increase linearly with the logarithm of the number of potential stimulus–response alternatives (e.g., hick’s law). the ubiquity and theoretical importance of this generalization make exceptions particularly interesting. recently, kveraga et al. (exp brain res 146:307, 2002) added a third to the two previously known exceptions, demonstrating that saccade latencies were unaffected by stimulus–response uncertainty. they suggest that visually guided saccades are exceptional, because these movements can be automatically selected using a privileged pathway: the topographically organized regions in superior colliculus that convert spatially coded visual activity into spatially coded motor commands. we report that visually guided, aimed hand movements also are unaffected by both stimulus–response uncertainty and stimulus–response repetition. a second experiment demonstrated that this lack of an uncertainty effect persists for equiluminant stimuli. this result suggests that posterior parietal cortex is not the privileged pathway eliminating stimulus–response uncertainty for hand movements. because hand movements are not guided by mechanisms in the superior colliculus, our results cast doubt on the privileged-pathway hypothesis, at least for hand movements. instead, the absence of stimulus–response uncertainty may occur only in tasks that do not require the stimulus to be associated with a response effector and that have high stimulus–response compatibility.
@background solute sorting in grass leaves: the transpiration stream the concentrations of vacuolar solutes in different cells of the upper epidermis of the third leaf of barley (hordeum vulgare l.) were studied in leaves of different ages grown under different irradiances (120 or 400 μmol photons·m−2·s−1). vacuolar saps were extracted from individual cells located at various positions between adjacent veins and were analysed for their osmolality and the concentrations of k+, ca2+, cl−, no3− and malate. each ion showed a cell-specific distribution within the epidermis that was both quantitatively and qualitatively dependent on the leaf developmental stage and on the light level. during leaf ageing, ca2+ accumulated preferentially in interstomatal cells (i.e. those located between longitudinally adjacent stomata) at concentrations up to 180 mm. under low light conditions, this was accompanied by a more or less equal decrease in k+ concentration. epidermal malate was found only in plants grown continuously or transiently under the high irradiance and reached highest concentrations in trough and interstomatal cells (60 to 150mm). chloride concentration was highest in cells overlying the veins (designated as ridge cells) and lowest in cells located between the veins (trough cells), while no3− exhibited the reverse distribution, although the precise patterns were age-dependent. epidermal osmolality increased with age, but the intercellular differences in the osmolalities were small compared to differences in vacuolar solute composition. a cell-to-cell analysis of the region surrounding the stomata showed that the steepest changes in the vacuolar solute composition of epidermal cells occurred at the boundary between ridge or trough cells and the adjacent near-stomatal cells.
@method mitigating adversarial effects through randomization very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. one example is the inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ilsvrc challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation inception-v3 network. this raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the inception architecture with residual connections. here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of inception networks significantly. there is also some evidence of residual inception networks outperforming similarly expensive inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. we also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual inception networks. these variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ilsvrc 2012 classification task significantly. we further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual inception networks. with an ensemble of three residual and one inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the imagenet classification (cls) challenge
@background orientation and direction selectivity of synaptic inputs in visual cortical neurons a diversity of combinations produces spike tuning stimulus-specific response properties, such as direction or orientation selectivity, were studied intracellularly in cells recorded from area 17 of the cat. in all 5 direction selective complex cells and one orientation selective simple cell successfully studied, visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) were tuned to the preferred direction or orientation. visually evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) were also tuned to the preferred direction/orientation of stimulus. ipsps evoked by the non-preferred stimulus when present were smaller than those evoked by the preferred stimulus. ipsps were undetected in two of the 5 cells tested. these results suggest that directionally/orientationally tuned epsps make a major contribution to stimulus specificity in visual cortical neurons but ipsps evoked by a stimulus with null-direction/orientation may sharpen the stimulus specificity.
@background new insulin glargine 300 u/ml versus glargine 100 u/ml in japanese adults with type 1 diabetes using basal and mealtime insulin: glucose control and hypoglycaemia in a randomized controlled trial (edition jp 1) objective insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes still provides suboptimal outcomes. insulin glargine 300 units/ml (gla-300), with a flatter pharmacodynamic profile compared with insulin glargine 100 units/ml (gla-100), is an approach to this problem. research design and methods people with type 1 diabetes, using a mealtime and basal insulin regimen, were randomized open-label to gla-300 or gla-100 and to morning or evening injection, continuing the mealtime analog, and followed for 6 months. results participants (n = 549) were a mean age of 47 years and had a mean duration of diabetes of 21 years and bmi of 27.6 kg/m2. the change in hba1c (primary end point; baseline 8.1%) was equivalent in the two treatment groups (difference, 0.04% [95% ci −0.10 to 0.19]) (0.4 mmol/mol [−1.1 to 2.1]), and gla-300 was thus noninferior. similar results with wider 95% cis were found for morning and evening injection times and for prebreakfast self-measured plasma glucose (smpg) overall. results were also similar for gla-300 when morning and evening injection time was compared, including overlapping 8-point smpg profiles. hypoglycemia did not differ, except for the first 8 weeks of the study, when nocturnal confirmed or severe hypoglycemia was lower with gla-300 (rate ratio 0.69 [95% ci 0.53–0.91]). hypoglycemia with gla-300 did not differ by time of injection. the basal insulin dose was somewhat higher at 6 months for gla-300. the adverse event profile did not differ and was independent of the gla-300 time of injection. weight gain was lower with gla-300. conclusions in long-duration type 1 diabetes, gla-300 provides similar glucose control to gla-100, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia after transfer from other insulins, independent of time of injection, and less weight gain.
@background silibinin inhibits colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. endothelium-derived relaxing factor (edrf) is a labile humoral agent which mediates the action of some vasodilators. nitrovasodi-lators, which may act by releasing nitric oxide (no), mimic the effect of edrf and it has recently been suggested by furchgott1 that edrf may be no. we have examined this suggestion by studying the release of edrf and no from endothelial cells in culture. no was determined as the chemiluminescent product of its reaction with ozone2. the biological activity of edrf and of no was measured by bioassay3. the relaxation of the bioassay tissues induced by edrf was indistinguishable from that induced by no. both substances were equally unstable. bradykinin caused concentration-dependent release of no from the cells in amounts sufficient to account for the biological activity of edrf. the relaxations induced by edrf and no were inhibited by haemoglobin and enhanced by superoxide dismutase to a similar degree. thus no released from endothelial cells is indistinguishable from edrf in terms of biological activity, stability, and susceptibility to an inhibitor and to a potentiator. we suggest that edrf and no are identical.
@method epidemiology of congenital heart defects (chd): results from a prospective, population-based cohort study (epicard) aims to estimate the risk of congenital heart defects (chd) associated with assisted reproductive technologies (art).   methods and results we used data from the paris registry of congenital malformations on 5493 cases of chd and 3847 malformed controls for which no associations with art were reported in the literature. assisted reproductive technologies included inductors of ovulation only, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. exposure to art was higher for cases than controls (4.7 vs. 3.6%, p= 0.008) and was associated with a 40% increase in the maternal age, socioeconomic factors, and year of birth-adjusted odds of chd without chromosomal abnormalities [adjusted odds ratio (or) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.1-1.7]. assisted reproductive technologies were specifically associated with significant increases in the odds of malformations of the outflow tracts and ventriculoarterial connections (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.2-2.4) and of cardiac neural crest defects and double outlet right ventricle (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.1-2.7). in general, we found specific associations between methods of art and subcategories of chd.   conclusion cases with chd were more likely to have been conceived following art when compared with malformed controls. this higher risk for chd varied specifically according to the method of art and the type of chd and may be due to art per se and/or the underlying infertility of couples.
@method gastrointestinal problems in children with autism, developmental delays or typical development diagnoses for autism based on the autism diagnostic interview-revised (adi-r) and the childhood autism rating scale (cars) were examined for 83 individuals with suspected autism. agreement between systems reached 85.7%. participants receiving diagnosis of autism based on only one system were significantly younger in age than individuals receiving diagnoses according to both systems. individuals who did not receive diagnosis of autism on the adi-r had lower chronological and mental ages and lower cars scores compared to individuals who received diagnosis of autism based on the adi-r. eighteen females and 18 males were matched to examine possible gender differences. no significant findings were revealed, suggesting that the symptoms of autism according to the adi-r and cars do not differ between males and females when matched for chronological and mental ages.
@background cross-channel co-occurrence matrices for robust characterization of surface disruptions in 21/2d rail image analysis we present an approach to high-resolution rail surface analysis combining 2d image texture classification and 21/2d analysis of surface disruptions. detailed analysis of images of rail surfaces is used to observe the condition of rails and, as a precaution, to avoid rail breaks and further damage. single rails are observed by a color line scan camera at high resolution of approximately 0.2 millimeters and under special illumination in order to enable 21/2d image analysis. gabor filter banks are used for 2d texture description and classes are modeled by gaussian mixtures. a bayesian classifier, which also incorporates background knowledge, is used to differentiate between surface texture classes. classes which can be related to surface disruptions are derived from the analysis of the anti-correlation properties between two color channels. images are illuminated by two light sources mounted at different position and operating at different wavelengths. results for data gathered in the vienna metro system are presented.
@method soft-body muscles for evolved virtual creatures: the next step on a bio-mimetic path to meaningful morphological complexity this article describes a system for the evolution and coevolution of virtual creatures that compete in physically simulated three-dimensional worlds. pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. the winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. the morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. the genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. when simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counterstrategies emerge.
@background the efficacy of colour cues in facilitating adaptation to opposing visuomotor rotations the relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. we set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45° counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45° away. subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. the cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. these results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. this suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.

@method inhibition of primate spinothalamic tract neurons by spinal glycine and gaba is modulated by guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. the responsiveness of spinal cord nociceptive neurons to innocuous mechanical stimuli can be increased by the release of excitatory amino acids (eaas) and peptides attributable to an injury-induced barrage of impulses. this sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons can also result from administration of phorbol ester by microdialysis, presumably by direct activation of protein kinase c (pkc). this study was designed to examine the effects of central sensitization of spinothalamic tract (stt) neurons produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin on the descending inhibition driven from the periaqueductal gray (pag) and the possible role of pkc in this process in anesthetized monkeys. sensitization of responses of stt cells to mechanical stimuli was induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. pag inhibition was significantly attenuated when sensitization of responses to mechanical stimuli occurred. however, perfusion of the spinal cord with npc15437 (a selective pkc inhibitor) by microdialysis could prevent the sensitization of the responses to mechanical stimuli and the reduction in pag inhibition of these responses induced by capsaicin injection. results similar to those produced by capsaicin injection were observed when a pkc activator, phorbol ester (12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), was infused within the dorsal horn by microdialysis. an inactive phorbol ester (4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) had no effect. these results provide evidence that the activation of pkc contributes to the development of central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons produced by chemical stimulation with capsaicin. attenuation of the effectiveness of pag inhibition takes place when the sensitization of dorsal horn cells develops, and pkc may play a significant role in this process.
@result differential effects of ozone on photosynthesis of winter wheat among cultivars depend on antioxidative enzymes rather than stomatal conductance. we present a comment about "ozone risk assessment for plants: central role of metabolism-dependent changes in reducing power" by dizengremel, le thiec, bagard, and jolivet. as tools for summarizing plant o(3) sensitivity in simple indices, dizengremel et al. suggest: reducing power, as antioxidant regeneration through the halliwell/asada cycle requires nadph from the photosynthetic light reaction; rubisco/pepc ratio, as an index of the energy balance between anabolic and catabolic reactions; and water-use efficiency as a time-integrated approximation of the carbon gain to stomatal o(3) uptake ratio. the scientific background is solid, and simple enough (although expensive) to be translated into modelling and routine use. in the last decade, several approaches have been developed, mostly by using photosynthesis as a metric of defence. all these approaches should be experimentally tested in different and realistic conditions, before the results are transferred to the field and used in effective o(3) flux modelling and assessment.
@method factors associated with red blood cell transfusions in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants in brazilian neonatal units bronchopulmonary dysplasia has become the most common pulmonary sequelae in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation. the pathogenesis of bpd is multifactorial, but prematurity, positive pressure ventilation, oxygen toxicity and pulmonary edema are some of the most important factors in its development. by minimizing these factors, it is possible to reduce the incidence and severity of bpd.
@background are ticks venomous animals? the tick, ornithodoros savignyi has been implicated in inducing paralysis and tampan toxicosis. in this study, a basic toxin (tsgp4) was identified and the presence of an acidic toxin (tsgp2) was confirmed. both basic and acidic toxins were more lethal than previously described, with tsgp4 (34microg) and tsgp2 (24microg) causing mortality of adult mice within 30min. pathological effects on the cardiac system, notably of salivary gland extract on an isolated rat heart perfusion system and of purified toxins on mouse electrocardiogram patterns could be observed. tsgp4 caused mobitz type ventricular block, while tsgp2 induced ventricular tachycardia. conversely, fractions from reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography preparations caused paralysis-like symptoms of the limbs after only 48h. the toxins also differ from previously described tick paralysis toxins in terms of molecular behavior and properties. these results indicate that tampan toxicoses and tick paralysis are unrelated pathogenic phenomena.
@background the methodological quality of systematic reviews comparing temporomandibular joint disorder surgical and non-surgical treatment in permanent temporomandibular disc displacement (tmj-dd) outcome studies many authors claim positive effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. this literature review was undertaken to analyse whether the claimed effects are based on acceptable methodology. the recorded papers were analysed by two independent observers according to (1) method of investigation, (2) therapeutic intervention studied, (3) therapeutic outcome variables used, and (4) claimed effectiveness of the intervention. agreement between observers was calculated. twenty-four papers were found in which therapeutic outcome of interventions on temporomandibular disorders were studied. six studies applied a true experimental design. each of these six studies compared a different set of interventions. twenty-two papers used maximal mouth opening (mmo) as an outcome variable, nine studied pain intensity on a visual analogue scale, one paper assessed the mandibular function impairment questionnaire. kappa for overall agreement concerning the reviewing criteria was 0.82 (p < or = 0.001). no distinguishing effects on mmo, pain or function impairment were reported between arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. results of methodological sound outcome studies evaluating the effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy are needed.
@method different statistical approaches to investigate porcine muscle metabolome profiles to highlight new biomarkers for pork quality assessment background advances in “omics” technologies have revolutionized the collection of biological data. a matching revolution in our understanding of biological systems, however, will only be realized when similar advances are made in informatic analysis of the resulting “big data.” here, we compare the capabilities of three conventional and novel statistical approaches to summarize and decipher the tomato metabolome. methodology principal component analysis (pca), batch learning self-organizing maps (bl-som) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) were applied to a multivariate nmr dataset collected from developmentally staged tomato fruits belonging to several genotypes. while pca and bl-som are appropriate and commonly used methods, wgcna holds several advantages in the analysis of highly multivariate, complex data. conclusions pca separated the two major genetic backgrounds (ac and nc), but provided little further information. both bl-som and wgcna clustered metabolites by expression, but wgcna additionally defined “modules” of co-expressed metabolites explicitly and provided additional network statistics that described the systems properties of the tomato metabolic network. our first application of wgcna to tomato metabolomics data identified three major modules of metabolites that were associated with ripening-related traits and genetic background.
@background constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases in human renal cell carcinoma. an explosion of new information linking activation of cell surface signal initiators to changes in gene expression has recently emerged. the focus of much of this information has centered around the agonist-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases. although this intracellular signal transduction pathway is extremely complex, conservation of many of its components has been observed in yeast, nematodes, drosophila, and mammals. thus, these signaling proteins may participate in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes.
@result predicting changes in perception of itching in chronic skin diseases by personality characteristics, anxiety, and depression pruritus and psyche are intricately and reciprocally related, with psychophysiological evidence and psychopathological explanations helping us to understand their complex association. their interaction may be conceptualized and classified into 3 groups: pruritic diseases with psychiatric sequelae, pruritic diseases aggravated by psychosocial factors, and psychiatric disorders causing pruritus. management of chronic pruritus is directed at treating the underlying causes and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to address the dermatologic, somatosensory, cognitive, and emotional aspects. pharmcotherapeutic agents that are useful for chronic pruritus with comorbid depression and/or anxiety comprise selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and doxepin), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin); the role of neurokinin receptor-1 antagonists awaits verification. antipsychotics are required for treating itch and formication associated with schizophrenia and delusion of parasitosis (including morgellons disease).
@method how to train dependency parsers with inexact search for joint sentence boundary detection and parsing of entire documents training higher-order conditional random fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. we present an approximated conditional random field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early updating. we show that our implementation yields fast and accurate morphological taggers across six languages with different morphological properties and that across languages higher-order models give significant improvements over 1-order models.
@background wild type mesenchymal cells contribute to the lung pathology of lymphangioleiomyomatosis the green fluorescence protein (gfp) from the ubi‐gfp/bl6 transgenic line was bred into c57bl/6j‐scid and c.b‐17‐scid mice for investigating host‐tumor cell interactions. these mice express high levels of gfp under the control of the ubiquitin promoter in virtually all cells examined. in tumor tissue generated by implanting tumor cells in the gfp transgenic scid mice, the tumor cells and tumor‐associated murine host cells were clearly distinguished by gfp expression. a population of cells expressing the endothelial cell marker vegfr‐2/flk‐1, and the progenitor markers c‐kit and sca‐1, were incorporated into tumor tissue. the majority of the flk‐1‐positive cells were hematopoietic‐derived cells that coexpressed cd45. to investigate the contribution of bone marrow‐derived cells to the formation of tumor vessels and stroma, tumor cells were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice that received a bone marrow transplant from gfp‐expressing scid mice. although gfp‐positive cells were readily detected by histology in tumors taken from bone marrow transplanted animals, they were spatially isolated and lacked organization. in contrast, if tumors were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice adjacent to a patch of transplanted gfp‐expressing skin, these tumors recruited gfp‐positive cells that organized into tumor vessels. the results demonstrate that hematopoietic‐derived cells, including flk‐1+/ cd45+ cells, readily colonized the tumor stroma but were minimally incorporated in the tumor vasculature. the majority of the tumor vessels were instead recruited from tissue adjacent to the tumor. the expression of flk‐1 on nonendothelial, tumor‐associated host cells raises the possibility that vegf antagonists, such as avastin, could inhibit tumor growth by a mechanism involving hematopoietic‐derived cd45+/flk‐1+ cells, in addition to direct suppression of endothelial cell function.—udagawa, t., puder, m., wood, m., schaefer, b. c., d'amato, r. j. analysis of tumor‐associated stromal cells using scid gfp transgenic mice: contribution of local and bone marrow‐derived host cells. faseb j. 20, 95–102 (2006)
@background bdnf boosts spike fidelity in chaotic neural oscillations. carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, produced three distinct spontaneous oscillations in the ca3 region of rat hippocampal slices. carbachol concentrations in the 4–13 μm range produced regular synchronized ca3 discharges at 0.5–2 hz (carbachol‐delta). higher concentrations (13–60 μm) produced short episodes of 5–10 hz (carbachol‐theta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8–25 μm also produced irregular episodes of high‐frequency discharges (carbachol‐gamma, 35–70 hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol‐theta and carbachol‐delta. at carbachol concentrations sufficient to induce carbachol‐theta, low concentrations of apv reversibly transformed carbachol‐theta into carbachol‐delta. higher concentrations of d,l‐2‐amino‐5‐phosphonopentanoic acid (apv) reversibly and completely blocked carbachol‐theta. a systematic study of the effects of carbachol shows that the frequency of spontaneous oscillations depended nonlinearly on the level of muscarinic activation. field and intracellular recordings from ca1 and ca3 pyramidal cells and interneurons during carbachol‐induced rhythms revealed that the hippocampal circuitry preserved in the slice was capable of spontaneous activity over the range of frequencies observed in vivo and suggests that the presence of these rhythms could be under neuromodulatory control. hippocampus 10:187–197, 2000 © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
@method mri‐related static magnetic stray fields and postural body sway: a double‐blind randomized crossover study there are concerns about workers repeatedly exposed to magnetic fields exceeding regulatory limits with respect to modern magnetic resonance imaging (mri). as a result, there is need for an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter capable of measuring these fields in and around an mri scanner in order to evaluate the regulatory guidelines and determine any underlying exposure risks. this study presents results of tri-axial measurements using an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter worn by workers during normal working shifts. we recorded and analyzed magnetic field exposures in and around 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t magnets during routine patient procedures. the data was integrated and averaged over time and evaluated against the latest exposure standards. time-varying magnetic fields occur when individuals move through spatially non-uniform static magnetic fields or during gradient-pulsed magnetic fields or a combination of both. our previous numerical analysis shows that at certain positions surrounding the mri scanner ends, such fields may induce current densities and electric fields that may exceed the relevant eu, icnirp, and ieee standards. a high-speed acquisition version of the dosimeter measured gradient-pulsed fields at positions accessible by mri workers near the scanner ends, and the results were evaluated and compared against the numerical simulations and the standards. our measurements confirm that workers can be exposed to magnetic fields exceeding the guidelines at positions near the gradient coil ends during clinical imaging and a high degree of correlation exists with the numerical results. while the time-weighted average magnetic field exposures in 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t were all within the regulatory limits during static magnetic field measurements, the peak limits for the head can be exceeded in some circumstances. this study presents a small number of routine shifts of data that provide indicative results of magnetic field exposure in real situations.
@method immunization of pigs with an attenuated pseudorabies virus recombinant expressing the haemagglutinin of pandemic swine origin h1n1 influenza a virus. attenuated vaccine strains of the alphaherpesvirus causing infectious laryngotracheitis of chickens (iltv, gallid herpesvirus 1) can be used for mass application. previously, we showed that live virus vaccination with recombinant iltv expressing hemagglutinin of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (hpaiv) protected chickens against ilt and fowl plague caused by hpaiv carrying the corresponding hemagglutinin subtypes [lüschow d, werner o, mettenleiter tc, fuchs w. protection of chickens from lethal avian influenza a virus infection by live-virus vaccination with infectious laryngotracheitis virus recombinants expressing the hemagglutinin (h5) gene. vaccine 2001;19(30):4249-59; veits j, lüschow d, kindermann k, werner o, teifke jp, mettenleiter tc, et al. deletion of the non-essential ul0 gene of infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) virus leads to attenuation in chickens, and ul0 mutants expressing influenza virus haemagglutinin (h7) protect against ilt and fowl plague. j gen virol 2003;84(12):3343-52]. however, protection against h5n1 hpaiv was not satisfactory. therefore, a newly designed dutpase-negative iltv vector was used for rapid insertion of the h5-hemagglutinin, or n1-neuraminidase genes of a recent h5n1 hpaiv isolate. compared to our previous constructs, protein expression was considerably enhanced by insertion of synthetic introns downstream of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter within the 5'-nontranslated region of the transgenes. deletion of the viral dutpase gene did not affect in vitro replication of the iltv recombinants, but led to sufficient attenuation in vivo. after a single ocular immunization, all chickens developed h5- or n1-specific serum antibodies. nevertheless, animals immunized with n1-iltv died after subsequent h5n1 hpaiv challenge, although survival times were prolonged compared to non-vaccinated controls. in contrast, all chickens vaccinated with either h5-iltv alone, or h5- and n1-iltv simultaneously, survived without showing any clinical signs. real-time rt-pcr indicated limited challenge virus replication after vaccination with h5-iltv only, which was completely blocked after coimmunization with n1-iltv. thus, chickens can be protected from h5n1 hpaiv-induced disease by live vaccination with an attenuated hemagglutinin-expressing iltv recombinant, and efficacy can be further increased by coadministration of an iltv mutant expressing neuraminidase. furthermore, chickens vaccinated with iltv vectors can be easily differentiated from influenza virus-infected animals by the absence of serum antibodies against the aiv nucleoprotein.
@background immunohistochemical characterization and quantification of lymphocytes infiltrating bovine lungs in east coast fever there is strong evidence that class i mhc-restricted parasite-specific cd8+ ctl protect cattle against the protozoan parasite theileria parva. as part of an effort to develop a subunit vaccine for the induction of these responses, we have investigated the factors involved in the generation of t. parva-specific ctl in cattle. purified populations of bovine immune and naive cd8+ t cells were cocultured with autologous t. parva-infected lymphoblasts (tpl) in the presence or absence of immune cd4+ t cells or cytokine preparations. neither population developed ctl activity when cultured with tpl alone, whereas incorporation of immune cd4+ t cells in the cultures supported the generation of parasite-specific ctl from both immune and naive cd8+ precursors. the helper function of parasite-specific cd4+ t cells for immune, but not naive, ctl precursors could be replaced by cd4+ t cells responding to an unrelated ag or by the addition of t cell growth factors or recombinant bovine il-2. in experiments with two-chamber culture plates, in which cocultures of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells with tpl were separated by a semipermeable membrane, ctl activity was observed to develop only in immune precursor populations. hence, although bovine t. parva-specific cd8+ memory t cells need no helper signals other than il-2 for activation, their naive counterparts require close contact with responding parasite-specific cd4+ t cells. this may reflect essential receptor-ligand interactions, or alternatively, a requirement for more stringent microenvironmental cytokine conditions.
@method predicting protein molecular function genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all eukaryotes. knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. the goal of the gene ontology consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. to this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the world-wide web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.
@background age-associated alterations of hippocampal place cells are subregion specific aged rats perform poorly on spatial learning tasks, a cognitive impairment which has been linked to the failure of hippocampal networks to fully encode changes in the external environment [barnes ca, suster ms, shen j, mcnaughton bl. multistability of cognitive maps in the hippocampus of old rats. nature 1997;388(6639):272-5; wilson ia, ikonen s, gureviciene i, mcmahan rw, gallagher m, eichenbaum h, et al. cognitive aging and the hippocampus: how old rats represent new environments. j neurosci 2004;24(15):3870-8]. to examine whether the impairment in hippocampal processing extends to conditions in which self-motion provides the cues for environmental change, we have analyzed spatial firing patterns of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in young and aged rats, as well as in young rats with selective cholinergic lesions, another model of cognitive aging. the rats walked between two visually identical environments, pitting self-motion cues that indicated environmental change against visual inputs that indicated no differences between environments. our results indicated that place cells in both aged and cholinergic-lesioned rats were equally likely as those of young rats to create new spatial representations in the second compartment. these findings suggest that the hippocampal network of aged rats is able to process changes in internally generated cues without rigidity, but that incomplete processing of external landmark cues may lead to impaired spatial learning.
@method population genetics of plasmodium vivax in the peruvian amazon backgroundperu is one of the latin american countries with the highest malaria burden, mainly due to plasmodium vivax infections. however, little is known about p. vivax transmission dynamics in the peruvian amazon, where most malaria cases occur. the genetic diversity and population structure of p. vivax isolates collected in different communities around iquitos city, the capital of the peruvian amazon, was determined.methodsplasmodium vivax population structure was determined by multilocus genotyping with 16 microsatellites on 159 p. vivax infected blood samples (mono-infections) collected in four sites around iquitos city. the population characteristics were assessed only in samples with monoclonal infections (n = 94), and the genetic diversity was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity and allelic richness. both linkage disequilibrium and the genetic differentiation (θ) were estimated.resultsthe proportion of polyclonal infections varied substantially by site (11% - 70%), with the expected heterozygosity ranging between 0.44 and 0.69; no haplotypes were shared between the different populations. linkage disequilibrium was present in all populations (ias 0.14 - 0.61) but was higher in those with fewer polyclonal infections, suggesting inbreeding and a clonal population structure. strong population differentiation (θ = 0.45) was found and the bayesian inference cluster analysis identified six clusters based on distinctive allele frequencies.conclusionthe p. vivax populations circulating in the peruvian amazon basin are genetically diverse, strongly differentiated and they have a low effective recombination rate. these results are in line with the low and clustered pattern of malaria transmission observed in the region around iquitos city.
@method evaluation of replication of variants associated with genetic risk of otitis media otitis media (om) is the most common childhood disease. almost all children experience at least one episode, but morbidity is greatest in children who experience chronic/recurrent om (come/rom). there is mounting evidence that come/rom clusters in families and exhibits substantial heritability. subjects who had tympanostomy tube surgery for come/rom (probands) and their families were recruited for the present study, and an ear examination was performed, without knowledge of the subject's history, to determine presence of om sequelae. in addition, tympanometric testing was performed at three frequencies (226, 630 or 710, and 1,400 hz) to detect abnormal middle-ear mechanics, and hearing was screened at 20 db for the speech frequencies. of these families, 121 had at least two individuals who had received the diagnosis of come/rom (364 affected and genotyped individuals), of whom 238 affected and informative relative pairs were used for analyses. single-point nonparametric linkage analysis provided evidence of linkage of come/rom to chromosome 10q at marker d10s212 (lod 3.78; p=3.0 x 10(-5)) and to chromosome 19q at marker d19s254 (lod 2.61; p=5.3 x 10(-4)). analyses conditional on support for linkage at chromosomes 10q and 19q resulted in a significant increase in lod score support on chromosome 3p (between markers d3s4545 and d3s1259). these results suggest that risk of come/rom is determined by interactions between genes that reside in several candidate regions of the genome and are probably modulated by other environmental risk factors.
@result behavioural addictions in adolescents and young adults: results from a prevalence study abstract objective taking into account the importance of act prevention on the development of addictions, we assessed the presence of multiple addictions in an adolescent high-school population, also assessing the prevalence of internet abuse and the impact on disability. introduction adolescence seems to be a critical period of addiction vulnerability, based on social but also neurobiological factors.the earlier onset of behavioral/substance dependence seems to predict greater addiction severity, morbidity, and multiple addictive disorders. methods data were collected from a sample of 275 students in florence, italy, high schools through surveys distributed in classes. the sample had an average age of 16.67±1.85 years (52.4% males, 47.6% females). to assess multiple addiction we used the 16 subscales of the shorter promis questionnaire, to assess internet addiction prevalence we used the internet addiction scale, and to quantify disability symptoms, we used the sheehan disability scale. results caffeine abuse, sex, relationship submissive, gambling, food starving, and food bingeing have raised highest scores. 5.4% of the students were found to be internet addicted similar to other countries. disability seemed strongly correlated to the subscale of alcohol, gambling, sex, tobacco, food starving and food bingeing, shopping, exercise, and internet addiction. gambling, sex, caffeine abuse, compulsive help dominant, work, internet addiction, relationship dominant, and relationship submissive in this sample were strongly related to substance dependence. conclusion level of concerns unexpected compared to the level reported in other countries for the behavioral compulsions, have been highlighted. behavioral addictions are multiple, a source of disability, and they are related to substance abuse. it has yet to be clarified if they are a temporary phenomenon occurring in adolescents or if they are a stable trait, accounting as marker for the development of substance abuse.
@background translation attenuation through eif2alpha phosphorylation prevents oxidative stress and maintains the differentiated state in beta cells. evidence for the physiological functions of ucp2 and ucp3 is critically reviewed. they do not mediate adaptive thermogenesis, but they may be significantly thermogenic under specific pharmacological conditions. there is strong evidence that the mild regulated uncoupling they cause attenuates mitochondrial ros production, protects against cellular damage, and diminishes insulin secretion. evidence that they export fatty acids physiologically is weak. ucp2 and ucp3 are important potential targets for treatment of aging, degenerative diseases, diabetes, and perhaps obesity.
@background cryptanalysis of grindahl we introduce vsh, very smooth hash, a new s-bit hash function that is provably collision-resistant assuming the hardness of finding nontrivial modular square roots of very smooth numbers modulo an s-bit composite. by very smooth, we mean that the smoothness bound is some fixed polynomial function of s. we argue that finding collisions for vsh has the same asymptotic complexity as factoring using the number field sieve factoring algorithm, i.e., subexponential in s.    vsh is theoretically pleasing because it requires just a single multiplication modulo the s-bit composite per ω(s) message-bits (as opposed to o(logs) message-bits for previous provably secure hashes). it is relatively practical. a preliminary implementation on a 1ghz pentium iii processor that achieves collision resistance at least equivalent to the difficulty of factoring a 1024-bit rsa modulus, runs at 1.1 megabyte per second, with a moderate slowdown to 0.7mb/s for 2048-bit rsa security.    vsh can be used to build a fast, provably secure randomised trapdoor hash function, which can be applied to speed up provably secure signature schemes (such as cramer-shoup) and designated-verifier signatures.
@background control of rna stability by nrrf, an iron-regulated small rna in neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mtrr transcriptional-regulatory protein is known to repress transcription of the mtrcde operon, which encodes a multidrug efflux pump possessed by neisseria gonorrhoeae that is important in the ability of gonococci to resist certain hydrophobic antibiotics, detergents, dyes, and host-derived antimicrobials. in order to determine whether mtrr can exert regulatory action on other gonococcal genes, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis using total rna extracted from actively growing broth cultures of isogenic mtrr-positive and mtrr-negative gonococci. we determined that, at a minimum, 69 genes are directly or indirectly subject to mtrr control, with 47 being mtrr repressed and 22 being mtrr activated. rpoh, which encodes the general stress response sigma factor rpoh (sigma 32), was found by dna-binding studies to be directly repressed by mtrr, as it was found to bind to a dna sequence upstream of rpoh that included sites within the rpoh promoter. mtrr also repressed the expression of certain rpoh-regulated genes, but this regulation was likely indirect and a reflection of mtrr control of rpoh expression. inducible expression of mtrr was found to repress rpoh expression and to increase gonococcal susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and an antibiotic (erythromycin) recognized by the mtrc-mtrd-mtre efflux pump system. we propose that, apart from its ability to control the expression of the mtrcde-encoded efflux pump operon and, as a consequence, levels of gonococcal resistance to host antimicrobials (e.g., antimicrobial peptides) recognized by the efflux pump, the ability of mtrr to regulate the expression levels of rpoh and rpoh-regulated genes also modulates levels of gonococcal susceptibility to h(2)o(2).
@background antigen 43, the major phase-variable protein of the escherichia coli outer membrane, can exist as a family of proteins encoded by multiple alleles. antigen 43 (ag43) is a prominent hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the outer membrane of escherichia coli. it is composed of two subunits. alpha 43 (m(r) 60, 000) and beta 43 (m(r) 53, 000) in 1:1 stoichiometry. alpha 43 is surface expressed, extends beyond the o-side chains of smooth lipopolysaccharide and is bound to the cell surface through an interaction with beta 43, itself an integral outer membrane protein, alpha 43 shows limited sequence homology with some enterobacterial adhesins. expression of ag43 is subject to reversible phase variation, the rates of variation from the ag43+ve to ag43-ve states in liquid minimal medium being approximately 2.2 x 10(-3), the corresponding rates from ag43-ve to ag43+ve states being approximately 1 x 10(-3). phase switching of genes encoding ag43 are transcriptionally regulated by dna methylation (deoxyadenosine methylase [dam] mutants being "locked off") and by oxyr (oxyr mutants being "locked on"). it is proposed that oxyr acts as a repressor of ag43 transcription by binding to unmethylated gatc sites in the regulatory region of the gene. sequencing and mapping has identified ag43 as the likely product of the metastable flu gene first described in 1980 by diderichsen and responsible for colony form variation in e. coli.
@background in vitro evaluation of anticancer properties of exopolysaccharides from lactobacillus acidophilus in colon cancer cell lines fungal isolates (aspergillus wentii 1, a. wentii 2, penicillium citrinum, penicillium granulatum) were selected to study their in vitro antioxidant potential by various assay procedures. czapek–dox’s medium was selected for the growth of fungi as it supported the best antioxidant activity based on their ec50 values, p. citrinum was the best followed by p. granulatum, a. wentii 1, and a. wentii 2. the chromatographic analyses showed several compounds possessing antioxidant activity in the fungal extracts. two such compounds were partially purified from p. citrinum which demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, equally effective or better than some of the standard antioxidants.
@method style obfuscation by invariance we present the word mover's distance (wmd), a novel distance function between text documents. our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. the wmd distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. we show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the earth mover's distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the wmd metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.
@result prevalence and predictors of complementary and alternative medicine use among people with coronary heart disease or at risk for this in the sixth tromsø study: a comparative analysis using protection motivation theory objective the focus of this study was to examine the patterns of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (cam) use across three chronic illness groups, and to identify the socio-demographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors associated with cam use.   design cross-sectional international survey administered on the internet to individuals with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and mixed chronic conditions.   main outcome measures self-reported consultations to cam providers and to a variety of conventional health-care services made in the previous 6 months.   results 365 surveys were received from people with arthritis (n=140), ibd (n=110), and other chronic conditions (n=115). overall 38.1% of respondents had used cam, with rates ranging from 31.8 to 46.1% across the three illness groups. backward step-wise logistic regression revealed that being female, having more than high school education, a greater number of comorbid conditions, higher perceived control over health and reward motivations, lower stress and less belief that health is governed by chance, were the best predictors of cam consultations. cam clients also used a greater variety of conventional health-care services and made more consultations relative to non-cam clients.   conclusions in this study the socio-demographic and health status factors associated with cam consultations in three different chronic illness groups were similar to those found in the general population. cam use in the study population was also related to higher use and a greater variety of use of conventional health-care services, and with stronger beliefs in the controllability of health and an enduring motivation to seek out rewards.
@background genomes of two new ammonia-oxidizing archaea enriched from deep marine sediments ammonia-oxidizing archaea are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. the isolation of candidatus “nitrosopumilus maritimus” strain scm1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain scm1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates n. maritimus grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. this unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry. the conservation of n. maritimus gene content and organization within marine metagenomes indicates that the unique physiology of these specialized oligophiles may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen.
@background assembly of hepatitis b virus envelope proteins onto a lentivirus pseudotype that infects primary human hepatocytes the pres domain at the n‐terminus of the large envelope protein (lhbs) of the hepatitis b virus is involved in (i) envelopment of viral nucleocapsids and (ii) binding to the host cell. while the first function suggests a cytosolic location of the pres domain during virion assembly, the function as an attachment site requires its translocation across the lipid bilayer and final exposure on the virion surface. we compared the transmembrane topology of newly synthesized lhbs in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane with its topology in the envelope of secreted virions. protease sensitivity and the absence of glycosylation suggest that the entire pres domain of newly synthesized lhbs remains at the cytosolic side of er vesicles. however, virions secreted from transfected cell cultures or isolated from the blood of persistent virus carriers expose antibody binding sites and proteolytic cleavage sites of the pres domain at their surface in approximately half of the lhbs molecules. thus, pres domains appear to be transported across the viral lipid barrier by a novel post‐translational translocation mechanism to fulfil a dual function in virion assembly and attachment to the host cell.
@background one species or two? vicariance, lineage divergence and low mtdna diversity in geographically isolated populations of south asian river dolphin uplift of mountains driven by tectonic forces can influence regional climate as well as regional drainage patterns, which in turn control the discharge of eroded sediment to the ocean. but the nature of the interactions between tectonic forces, climate and drainage evolution remains contested. here we reconstruct the erosional discharge from the indus river over the past 30 million years using seismic reflection data obtained from drill core samples from the arabian sea and neodymium isotope data. we find that the source of the indus sediments was dominated by erosion within and north of the indus suture zone until five million years ago; after that, the river began to receive more erosional products from himalayan sources. we propose that this change in the erosional pattern is caused by a rerouting of the major rivers of the punjab into the indus, which flowed east into the ganges river before that time. seismic reflection profiles from the indus fan suggest high mass accumulation rates during the pleistocene epoch partly driven by increased drainage to the indus river after five million years ago and partly by faster erosion linked to a stronger monsoon over the past four million years. our isotope stratigraphy for the indus fan provides strong evidence for a significant change in the geometry of western himalayan river systems in the recent geologic past.
@background gserf6, an ethylene-responsive factor from glycine soja, mediates the regulation of plant bicarbonate tolerance in arabidopsis nadp-malic enzyme (nadp-me, ec 1.1.1.40) functions in many different pathways in plants, and has recently been implicated in plant defense such as in responses to wounding and uv-b radiation. in this study, we isolated a complementary dna (cdna) clone by using the differential display method and screening of a root cdna library of rice (oryza sativa. l) under carbonate (nahco3) stress, and identified it as one of the rice nadp-me genes (we named it nadp-me2, genbank accession no. ab053295). the 5′ end of nadp-me2 was obtained by the 5′-race method, and the full-length cdna had a length of 2217 bp encoding 593 amino acids. expression of nadp-me2 mrna in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and environmental ph changes. nadp-me2 transcripts increased during 72-h exposures to nahco3, nacl, and peg stresses. furthermore, nadp-me activities in leaves and roots of rice seedlings increased by more than 50% in the presence of carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and peg. these results indicate that rice nadp-me2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 were obtained through transformation, screening, northern analysis and in situ nadp-me activity assay. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 grew well in 1/2 × ms medium with 100 mm nacl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (wt) arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited. in addition, under 125 mm nacl stress, the root lengths of transgenic lines were about twice as long as those of the wt. these results suggest that nadp-me2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress.
@method apoptosis of lens epithelial cells induced by high concentration of glucose is associated with a decrease in caveolin-1 levels gpi-linked protein molecules become triton-insoluble during polarized sorting to the apical cell surface of epithelial cells. these insoluble complexes, enriched in cholesterol, glycolipids, and gpi-linked proteins, have been isolated by flotation on sucrose density gradients and are thought to contain the putative gpi-sorting machinery. as the cellular origin and molecular protein components of this complex remain unknown, we have begun to characterize these low-density insoluble complexes isolated from mdck cells. we find that these complexes, which represent 0.4-0.8% of the plasma membrane, ultrastructurally resemble caveolae and are over 150-fold enriched in a model gpi-anchored protein and caveolin, a caveolar marker protein. however, they exclude many other plasma membrane associated molecules and organelle-specific marker enzymes, suggesting that they represent microdomains of the plasma membrane. in addition to caveolin, these insoluble complexes contain a subset of hydrophobic plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmically-oriented signaling molecules, including: (a) gtp- binding proteins--both small and heterotrimeric; (b) annex ii--an apical calcium-regulated phospholipid binding protein with a demonstrated role in exocytic fusion events; (c) c-yes--an apically localized member of the src family of non-receptor type protein- tyrosine kinases; and (d) an unidentified serine-kinase activity. as we demonstrate that caveolin is both a transmembrane molecule and a major phospho-acceptor component of these complexes, we propose that caveolin could function as a transmembrane adaptor molecule that couples luminal gpi-linked proteins with cytoplasmically oriented signaling molecules during gpi-membrane trafficking or gpi-mediated signal transduction events. in addition, our results have implications for understanding v- src transformation and the actions of cholera and pertussis toxins on hetero-trimeric g proteins.
@result potassium channels modulate the action but not the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide in rat corpus cavernosum the relaxant effect of hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in the vascular tree is well established but its influence and mechanism of action in gastrointestinal smooth muscle was hardly investigated. the influence of h(2)s on contractility in mouse gastric fundus was therefore examined. sodium hydrogen sulfide (nahs; h(2)s donor) was administered to prostaglandin f(2alpha) (pgf(2alpha))-contracted circular muscle strips of mouse gastric fundus, before and after incubation with interfering drugs. nahs caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the pre-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the k(+) channels blockers glibenclamide, apamin, charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridin and barium chloride had no influence on the nahs-induced relaxation. the relaxation by nahs was also not influenced by l-name, odq and sq 22536, inhibitors of the cgmp and camp pathway, by nerve blockers capsazepine, omega-conotoxin and tetrodotoxin or by several channel and receptor blockers (ouabain, nifedipine, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, ryanodine and thapsigargin). the myosin light chain phosphatase (mlcp) inhibitor calyculin-a reduced the nahs-induced relaxation, but the rho-kinase inhibitor y-27632 had no influence. we show that nahs is able to relax pgf(2alpha)-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the results suggest that in the mouse gastric fundus, h(2)s causes relaxation at least partially via activation of mlcp.
@method the candida albicans homologue of pig-p, cagpi19p: gene dosage and role in growth and filamentation. abstract ras oncoproteins are monomeric gtpases that link signals from the cell surface to pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. constitutively active mutant forms of ras are found in ca. 30% of human tumors. here we report the isolation of a novel gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated eri1 (for endoplasmic reticulum-associated ras inhibitor 1), which behaves genetically as an inhibitor of ras signaling. eri1 encodes a 68-amino-acid protein that associates in vivo with gtp-bound ras in a manner that requires an intact ras-effector loop, suggesting that eri1 competes for the same binding site as ras target proteins. we show that eri1 localizes primarily to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (er), where it engages ras. the recent demonstration that signaling from mammalian ras is not restricted to the cell surface but can also proceed from the cytoplasmic face of the er suggests a regulatory function for eri1 at that membrane.
@result high dispersal ability and low genetic differentiation in the widespread butterfly species melanargia galathea many studies aim at testing the impact of recent fragmentation on the genetic diversity and connectivity of populations, while some species do exist naturally in fragmented landscapes because of their habitat requirements. therefore, it is important to look at the genetic signatures of species occurring in naturally fragmented landscapes in order to disentangle the effect of fragmentation from the effect of habitat requirements. we selected two nymphalid butterflies for this purpose. while melanargia galathea is a common butterfly in flower-rich meadows, melitaea aurelia is closely connected to calcareous grasslands, thus being historically fragmented due to its ecological demands. for the analysis of the genetic response on these opposed patterns, we analysed 18 allozyme loci for 789 individuals (399 individuals of m. galathea and 390 individuals of m. aurelia) in a western german study region with adjacent areas in luxemburg and northeastern france. both species showed similarly low genetic differentiations among local populations (m. galathea: fst 3.3%; m. aurelia: fst 3.6%), both combined with a moderate level of inbreeding. isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant correlation for both species with similar amounts of explained variances (m. galathea: r2 = 27.8%; m. aurelia: r2 = 28.5%). most parameters of genetic diversity were higher in m. galathea than in m. aurelia, but the latter species had a considerably higher amount of rare or locally restricted genes; the differing ecological demands are thus reflected in these differences. both species thus seem to be genetically well suited to their respective ecological requirements. in the light of conservation genetics, we deduce that highly fragmented populations are not necessarily prone to extinction. the extinction risk might be linked to the life history of an organism and its population genetic structure.
@result burnout syndrome and associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study purpose burnout, a marker of professional distress prevalent among residents and physicians, has been speculated to originate in medical school. little is known about burnout in medical students. the authors sought to identify the prevalence of burnout, variation of its prevalence during medical school, and the impact of personal life events on burnout and other types of student distress. method all medical students (n = 1,098) attending the three medical schools in minnesota were surveyed in spring 2004 using validated instruments to assess burnout, quality of life, depression, and alcohol use. students were also asked about the prevalence of positive and negative personal life events in the previous 12 months. results a total of 545 medical students (response rate 50%) completed the survey. burnout was present in 239 (45%) of medical students. while the frequency of a positive depression screen and at-risk alcohol use decreased among more senior students, the frequency of burnout increased (all p < .03). the number of negative personal life events in the last 12 months also correlated with the risk of burnout (p = .0160). personal life events demonstrated a stronger relationship to burnout than did year in training on multivariate analysis. conclusions burnout appears common among u.s. medical students and may increase by year of schooling. despite the notion that burnout is primarily linked to work-related stress, personal life events also demonstrated a strong relationship to professional burnout. the authors' findings suggest both personal and curricular factors are related to burnout among medical students. efforts to decrease burnout must address both of these elements.
@method membuilder: a web-based graphical interface to build heterogeneously mixed membrane bilayers for the gromacs biomolecular simulation program biological membranes are versatile in composition and host intriguing molecular processes. in order to be able to study these systems, an accurate model hamiltonian or force field (ff) is a necessity. here, we report the results of our extension of earlier developed all-atomistic ff parameters for fully saturated phospholipids that complements an earlier parameter set for saturated phosphatidylcholine lipids (j. phys. chem. b, 2012, 116, 3164-3179). the ff, coined slipids (stockholm lipids), now also includes parameters for unsaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, e.g., popc, dopc, sopc, pope, and dope. as the extended set of parameters is derived with the same philosophy as previously applied, the resulting ff has been developed in a fully consistent manner. the capabilities of slipids are demonstrated by performing long simulations without applying any surface tension and using the correct isothermal-isobaric (npt) ensemble for a range of temperatures and carefully comparing a number of properties with experimental findings. results show that several structural properties are very well reproduced, such as scattering form factors, nmr order parameters, thicknesses, and area per lipid. thermal dependencies of different thicknesses and area per lipid are reproduced as well. lipid diffusion is systematically slightly underestimated, whereas the normalized lipid diffusion follows the experimental trends. this is believed to be due to the lack of collective movement in the relatively small bilayer patches used. furthermore, the compatibility with amino acid ffs from the amber family is tested in explicit transmembrane complexes of the walp23 peptide with dlpc and dopc bilayers, and this shows that slipids can be used to study more complex and biologically relevant systems.
@method sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease after high-dose intravenous busulfan/melphalan conditioning therapy in high-risk ewing sarcoma sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease (sos/vod), is a potentially life threatening complication that can develop after hematopoietic cell transplantation. although sos/vod progressively resolves within a few weeks in most patients, the most severe forms result in multi-organ dysfunction and are associated with a high mortality rate (>80%). therefore, careful attention must be paid to allow an early detection of sos/vod, particularly as drugs have now proven to be effective and licensed for its treatment. unfortunately, current criteria lack sensitivity and specificity, making early identification and severity assessment of sos/vod difficult. the aim of this work is to propose a new definition for diagnosis, and a severity-grading system for sos/vod in adult patients, on behalf of the european society for blood and marrow transplantation.
@method removing noisy mentions for distant supervision distant supervision for relation extraction (re) -- gathering training data by aligning a database of facts with text -- is an efficient approach to scale re to thousands of different relations. however, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. for example, a sentence containing balzac and france may express bornin or died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. we propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for re, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. our model performs competitively on two difficult domains.
@background distress in couples approached for genetic counseling and brca1/2 testing during adjuvant radiotherapy background: despite the potential importance of communication about genetic testing between test participants and their significant others, little is known about social support and communication between women undergoing brca1 and brca2 testing and their partners.purpose: the aims of this longitudinal study were to examine communication about genetic testing during and following testing and to evaluate whether communication is associated with psychological distress reported by test participants and their partners.methods: participants were 153 women who were undergoing genetic testing and 118 partners of women undergoing testing. relationship communication and distress were evaluated at the time of pretest education and 6 months postdisclosure.results: overall, the decision to undergo testing was discussed by the majority of test participants and partners, and most couples felt their partners were supportive. most women disclosed their results to their partners. longitudinal analyses suggested that less support and protective buffering were associated with greater distress 6 months postdisclosure among test participants, whereas lower comfort in sharing concerns and partner support were associated with lower distress 6 months postdisclosure among partners.conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the majority of couples respond supportively during the test experience, but for a small subset of couples the process can strain the relationship. partner support during this process is important, particularly for test participants dealing with an uninformative test result.
@method dna-dna hybridization study of strains of chryseobacterium, elizabethkingia and empedobacter and of other usually indole-producing non-fermenters of cdc groups iic, iie, iih and iii, mostly from human clinical sources, and proposals of chryseobacterium bernardetii sp. nov., chryseobacterium carnis s the name escherichia vulneris sp. nov. (formerly called alma group 1 and enteric group 1 by the centers for disease control and api group 2 by analytab products, inc.) is proposed for a group of isolates from the united states and canada, 74% of which were from human wounds. e. vulneris is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative, fermentative, motile rod with the characteristics of the family enterobacteriaceae. biochemical reactions characteristic of 61 e. vulneris strains were positive tests for methyl red, malonate, and lysine decarboxylase; a delayed positive test for arginine dihydrolase; acid production from d-mannitol, l-arabinose, raffinose, l-rhamnose, d-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and melibiose; negative tests for voges-proskauer, indole, urea, h(2)s, citrate, ornithine decarboxylase, phenylalanine deaminase, and dnase; and no acid from dulcitol, adonitol, myo-inositol, and d-sorbitol. two-thirds of the strains produced yellow pigment. most strains gave negative or delayed positive reactions in tests for lactose, sucrose, and kcn. the e. vulneris strains tested were resistant to penicillin and clindamycin, were resistant or showed intermediate zones of inhibition to carbenicillin and erythromycin, and were susceptible to 14 other antibiotics. dna relatedness of 15 e. vulneris strains to the type strain averaged 75% in reactions at 60 degrees c and 69% in reactions at 75 degrees c, indicating that they comprise a separate species. dna relatedness to other species in the family enterobacteriaceae was 6 to 39%, an indication that this new species belongs in the family. e. vulneris showed the highest relatedness to species of escherichia (25 to 39%) and enterobacter (24 to 35%). on the basis of biochemical similarity, the new species was placed in the genus escherichia. the type strain of e. vulneris is atcc 33821 (cdc 875-72).
@method vascular autorescaling of fmri (vasa fmri) improves sensitivity of population studies: a pilot study the human connectome project (hcp) seeks to map the structural and functional connections between network elements in the human brain. magnetoencephalography (meg) provides a temporally rich source of information on brain network dynamics and represents one source of functional connectivity data to be provided by the hcp. high quality meg data will be collected from 50 twin pairs both in the resting state and during performance of motor, working memory and language tasks. these data will be available to the general community. additionally, using the cortical parcellation scheme common to all imaging modalities, the hcp will provide processing pipelines for calculating connection matrices as a function of time and frequency. together with structural and functional data generated using magnetic resonance imaging methods, these data represent a unique opportunity to investigate brain network connectivity in a large cohort of normal adult human subjects. the analysis pipeline software and the dynamic connectivity matrices that it generates will all be made freely available to the research community.
@background behavioural and medical predictors of bacterial vaginosis recurrence among female sex workers: longitudinal analysis from a randomized controlled trial bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by dramatic changes in the vaginal ecosystem. women without evidence of vaginal infection may exhibit transient changes in their flora. we prospectively followed up women by using diaries and self-obtained vaginal smears to correlate behaviors with changes in flora. the majority of women (38/51, 78%) had significant, although transient, changes. behaviors associated with unstable flora were a history of bv, a greater number of partners, and more frequent episodes of receptive oral sex. only the latter remained significantly associated in the multivariate analysis. variables that were associated with day-to-day variability in the flora included use of vaginal medication, menses, greater number of partners, spermicide use, more frequent vaginal intercourse, and less frequent use of condoms. only a minority of women (11/51, 22%) maintained a "normal" lactobacillus-predominant flora. factors associated with instability of the flora are similar to those epidemiologically associated with bv.
@method circulating micrornas as a novel class of diagnostic biomarkers in gastrointestinal tumors detection: a meta-analysis based on 42 articles background:plasma circulating tumour-specific micrornas (mirnas) are promising biomarkers of tumour presence and recurrence, especially for diseases whose best chance of successful treatment requires early diagnosis and timely surgery of an already malignant but not yet invasive tumour, such as colorectal cancer (crc).methods:expression levels of mirnas previously found to be differently expressed in tumour vs normal colon tissues were investigated by quantitative real-time pcr in plasma from crc patients and from healthy donors and confirmed in independent case control series. the validated mirnas were also measured after surgery. analyses were repeated on the subsets of haemolysis-free samples.results:we identified four mirnas differently expressed between the compared groups, two (mir-21 and mir-378) of which were validated. mir-378 expression decreased in non-relapsed patients 4–6 months after surgery and mir-378 ability to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals was not influenced by haemolysis levels of plasma samples.conclusion:the mirna analysis on plasma samples represents a useful non-invasive tool to assess crc presence as well as tumour-free status at follow-up. plasma levels of mir-378 could be used to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals, irrespective of the level of haemoglobin of plasma samples.

@method fungal and bacterial growth in floor dust at elevated relative humidity levels abstract we introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. this method, unifrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. unifrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. we demonstrate the utility of unifrac by applying it to published 16s rrna gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the arctic and antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. these results illustrate that unifrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rrna sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.
@method epitope-specific anti-hcg vaccines on a virus like particle platform filamentous phages are now the most widely used vehicles for phage display and provide efficient means for epitope identification. however, the peptides they display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient b-cell activation. meanwhile, systems based on virus-like particles (vlps) permit the engineered high-density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library display and affinity selection. we developed a new peptide display platform based on vlps of the rna bacteriophage ms2. it combines the high immunogenicity of ms2 vlps with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display systems. here, we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of high-complexity random sequence peptide libraries on ms2 vlps and that allow control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of display valency. we used the system to identify epitopes for several previously characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the vlps thus obtained elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting antibodies.
@background 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate glue for fixation of stsg in genitourinary tissue defects due to fournier gangrene: a preliminary trial. background in recent years, the use of synthetic glues has become an established practice in several areas of surgical treatment. for example, they are used in open and laparoscopic surgery and in digestive tract endoscopy, interventional radiology, and vascular neuroradiology. the experiments in this study were aimed at elucidating that suture-based permanent mesh fixation can be replaced by fixation with n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue (glubran2) for surgical repair of abdominal wall hernias.   materials and methods in 25 wistar rats, two hernia defects (1.5 cm in diameter) per animal were created bilaterally in the midline of the abdominal wall. the peritoneum was spared. the lesions were left untreated for 10 d to achieve a chronic condition. then the defects were covered with timesh extralight (2 × 2 cm) and fixed by 30 μl of glubran2 or traditional suture. the time points of sacrifice were 17 and 28 d, 3, 4, and 5 mo. at autopsy, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response and the presence of apoptotic cells respectively.   results mesh fixation was excellent in all samples at each time point. at application sites, the inflammatory reaction was mild with a small number of macrophages and vascularized connective tissue presence around glue and mesh threads. glue residues were observed in histologic sections at each time point. no presence of apoptotic cells was found.   conclusions this study demonstrated that glubran2 can effectively replace traditional suture in mesh fixation without affecting tissue healing and determining a physiological inflammatory reaction at the abdominal wall site.
@background clustering by authorship within and across documents with its close ties to the web, the ir community is destined to leverage the dissemination and collaboration capabilities that the web provides today. especially with the advent of the software as a service principle, an ir community is conceivable that publishes experiments executable by anyone over the web. a review of recent sigir papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration. the benefits of publishing ir experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, and include potential to boost research profiles and reputation. however, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice. to foster experiments as a service in ir, we present a web framework for experiments that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing solutions. we also describe how our reference implementation is already used officially as an evaluation platform for an established international plagiarism detection competition.
@background functional dissection of the tbk1 molecular network toll-like receptors (tlrs) are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce innate immune responses and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons and anti-inflammatory cytokines. tlrs activate downstream effectors through adaptors that contain toll/interleukin-1 receptor (tir) domains, but the mechanisms accounting for diversification of tlr effector functions are unclear. to dissect biochemically tlr signalling, we established a system for isolating signalling complexes assembled by dimerized adaptors. using myd88 as a prototypical adaptor, we identified tnf receptor-associated factor 3 (traf3) as a new component of tir signalling complexes that is recruited along with traf6. using myeloid cells from traf3- and traf6-deficient mice, we show that traf3 is essential for the induction of type i interferons (ifn) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (il-10), but is dispensable for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in fact, traf3-deficient cells overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to defective il-10 production. despite their structural similarity, the functions of traf3 and traf6 are largely distinct. traf3 is also recruited to the adaptor trif (toll/il-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing ifn-β) and is required for marshalling the protein kinase tbk1 (also called nak) into tir signalling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of the ifn response.
@background enrichment effects on adult cognitive development the authors examined longitudinal change in chess skill using a multilevel model analysis of a large database of active, elite chess players (n = 5,011). parameters estimated from quadratic growth curves indicated that the age of peak performance occurs later in life than originally proposed and that this peak is independent of initial skill level. the findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that aging is slightly kinder to the initially more able, who show milder decline past their peak. higher tournament activity levels predicted higher ratings overall and interacted with age in the initially more able sample, suggesting that activity had smaller effects on rating for older adults. the authors discuss implications of these findings for lifetime changes in skilled performance.
@method drug-target interaction prediction by integrating multiview network data identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step for drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. since it is expensive to determine the interactions experimentally, computational methods are needed for predicting interactions. in this work, the authors first propose a single-view penalised graph (spgraph) clustering approach to integrate drug structure and protein sequence data in a structural view. the spgraph model does clustering on drugs and targets simultaneously such that the known drug-target interactions are best preserved in the clustering results. they then apply the spgraph to a chemical view with drug response data and gene expression data in nci-60 cell lines. they further generalise the spgraph to a multi-view penalised graph (mpgraph) version, which can integrate the structural view and chemical view of the data. in the authors' experiments, they compare their approach with some comparison partners, and the results show that the spgraph could improve the prediction accuracy in a small scale, and the mpgraph can achieve around 10% improvements for the prediction accuracy. they finally give some new targets for 22 food and drug administration approved drugs for drug repositioning, and some can be supported by other references.
@background monoallelic loss of the imprinted gene grb10 promotes tumor formation in irradiated nf1+/- mice tumorigenesis requires the interaction between different gene disruptions to convert anormal cell into a cancer cell. these gene disruptions can involve loss of expression ormisexpression of genes through genetic or epigenetic mutations. it is becoming clear that thesedisruptions are not isolated events in the genome, but are affected by genome architecture andthe syntenic relationship of alleles on chromosomes. a better understanding of the genetic andepigenetic changes in cancer is important for the rational design of new therapies. we haverecently shown that background-specific polymorphisms and loci under epigenetic regulationhave a strong effect on cancer susceptibility in a mouse model of astrocytoma. although thesemice carry mutations in p53 and ras signaling pathways (through mutation of the rasgapprotein, nf1), the susceptibility to different tumor types depends strongly on epigeneticregulation and does not show simple mendelian inheritance. our results demonstrate theimportance of genome architecture and how tumorigenesis can be accelerated by concomitantloss or gain of multiple genes in a single chromosome rearrangement. because genomearchitecture is very different between mice and humans, comparing patterns of genomicrearrangement in human cancer and mouse models may help distinguish causal genomic changesfrom correlative changes.
@background impact of p53 and pdgfr-β expression on metastasis and prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated death but has been difficult to study because it involves a series of rare, stochastic events. to capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt). circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. emt and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. these results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating emt and entry into the circulation.
@method biological activity evaluation and molecular docking study of chromone derivatives as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors rous sarcoma virus was shown to induce in chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) a 4.1-kilobase mrna (designated cef-147) encoding a 603-amino acid protein. analysis of the protein sequence showed that it shared 59% amino acid identity with sheep prostaglandin g/h synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in the production of prostaglandins. significant differences, at both the protein and mrna levels, existed between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. a distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase mrna is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. additionally, the majority of the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase rna present in nonproliferating cells was found to be nonfunctional because of the presence of an unspliced intron that separated the signal peptide from the remainder of the protein. upon mitogenic stimulation, this intron was removed, resulting in the induction of fully-spliced cef-147 mrna.
@background diversity of enterococcus faecalis genotypes from multiple oral sites associated with endodontic failure using repetitive sequence‐based polymerase chain reaction and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide probes which match consensus sequences of the repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) element hybridize to genomic dna of diverse bacterial species. primers based on the rep sequence generate complex band patterns with genomic dna in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), a technique named rep-pcr. we used rep-pcr with genomic dna to fingerprint 47 isolates of citrobacter diversus. previously, 37 were assigned electrophoretic types (ets) by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and 35 were evaluated by using outer membrane protein profiles. fingerprints were compared by visual inspection and by similarity coefficients (simcs) based on the number of common bands versus total bands between two given isolates. dna fingerprints were highly similar visually for patient pairs and outbreak-related sets. simcs for these were > or = 0.952. fingerprints of isolates with different ets generally were distinctive. among 21 unrelated isolates representing 15 ets, only 6 of 210 comparisons had simcs of > or = 0.952. rep-pcr rapidly generated dna fingerprints which were highly similar for epidemiologically linked isolates of c. diversus and distinct for previously characterized strains within this species. the ability of this method to discriminate between c. diversus isolates with the same biotype was similar to that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and outer membrane protein profiles. rep-pcr may be useful in evaluation of apparent outbreaks of this or other bacterial species which possess these extragenic, repetitive elements.
@background increased parental history of bipolar disorder in the united states: association with early age of onset objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
@background biocompatibility evaluation of densified bacterial nanocellulose hydrogel as an implant material for auricular cartilage regeneration phosphorylcholine (pc)-based polymers have been used in a variety of medical device applications to improve biocompatibility. the use of pc-based materials for biomaterials is associated with low protein adsorption, reduced complement activation, low inflammatory response and cell adhesion. for some medical device applications however, materials that support cell adhesion are also beneficial, allowing host interaction and encouraging full incorporation within the body. as previous studies have suggested that cell adhesion to materials is enhanced by the addition of charge, pc-based polymers have therefore been modified to incorporate various concentrations of cationic charge. in this study, the affect of cationic charge on a range of biological responses was investigated. in vitro assays have been used to assess the adsorption of protein onto the materials surface, the adhesion of mouse fibroblasts and rabbit corneal epithelial cells and the adhesion of human mononuclear cells and granulocytes. the results corroborate previous work showing that pc without charge significantly reduces protein adsorption, cell adhesion and inflammatory cell activation. the addition of cationic charge to pc polymers however, resulted in an increase in all of the above responses. this increase did not however, increase linearly with cationic monomer concentration. the differences in cell adhesion are discussed in terms of differences in protein adsorption, cytotoxicity and/or stability of the different cationic polymer coatings.
@method structural and logical analysis of a comprehensive hedgehog signaling pathway to identify alternative drug targets for glioma, colon and pancreatic cancer kit, platelet‐derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfrs) are important clinical targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. the frequency of kit and vegfr2 amplification in glioblastomas is not known, and few data are available in any other human tumour type. we investigated 43 primary glioblastomas for kit, vegfr2, pdgfra and egfr amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization. kit was amplified in 47% and vegfr2 in 39% of the glioblastomas, respectively, and pdgfra in 29%. thirty‐five (81%) of the tumours had either kit or egfr amplification. kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 amplifications were strongly associated (p < 0.0001 for each pairwise comparison), suggesting co‐amplification, whereas no significant association was found with egfr amplification. the four secondary glioblastomas arising from pre‐existing lower grade astrocytic tumours investigated had kit amplification but none had egfr amplification. no mutations were detected with denaturing high‐performance liquid chromatography in kit exons 9, 11, 13 or 17, pdgfra exons 12 and 18, or egfr exons 18, 19 or 21. glioblastomas with kit, pdgfr or vegfr2 amplification were associated with similar outcome to other glioblastomas. we conclude that kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 are commonly amplified in primary glioblastoma and that they may also be amplified in secondary glioblastoma. amplified kinases may be potential targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. copyright © 2005 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
@background kidney histologic alterations in α-galactosidase-deficient mice early renal changes in hemizygous and heterozygous patients with fabry's disease. renal biopsy specimens were obtained for light and electron microscopy in 12 patients with fabry's disease (9 hemizygous males and 3 heterozygous females), ranging in age from 7 to 51yr. renal function and blood pressure were normal in all patients. in hemizygous patients, diffuse glycolipid accumulation was observed early in life in every glomerular, vascular, and interstitial cell; tubules were involved irregularly, predominantly in distal convoluted tubules and henle's loop. in heterozygous females, the glycolipid storage had the same morphological features but was found irregularly, being absent in one patient and present patchily in the 2 others: some cells were normal, others were involved massively. associated degenerative renal changes were present in all patients but one (a heterozygous female) and were clearly age-related. they first affected vessels as round fibrinoid deposits resulting from necrosis of severely involved smooth muscle cells. in older patients, intimal thickening was superimposed, and degenerative glomerular and tubular changes were noted. they may have been related partly to ischemic damage. in addition, mesangial cell necrosis could have contributed to the development of glomerular sclerosis. our findings in heterozy-gotes are consistent with lyon's hypothesis of x chromosome inactivation in each female cell. they suggest that renal glycolipid involvement and urine a-glactosidase activity are closely related. they provide theoretical evidence against the possible benefits of enzyme replacement therapy. lesions renales precoces chez les sujets hemizygotes et heterozygotes atteints de maladie de fabry. les biopsies renales de 12 malades âges de 7 a 51 ans (9 sujets hemizygotes et 3 heterozygotes) ont ete etudiees en microscopie optique et electronique. tous avaient une fonction renale et une pression arterielle normales. chez les sujets de sexe masculin, hemizygotes, l'accumulation de glycolipides est precoce et diffuse, presente dans toutes les cellules glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires. dans les tubes la surcharge est irreguliere et predomine sur les tubes contournes distaux et les anses de henle. chez les femmes transmettrices l'aspect est moins monomorphe: la surcharge est absente chez une malade, elle est presente chez les deux autres mais touche irregulierement les cellules tant glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires que tubulaires. les lesions degeneratives du parenchyme renal, associees a la surcharge, sont presentes dans tous les cas sauf chez une des transmettrices, leur severite est correlee avec l'âge des malades. elles touchent d'abord les vaisseaux sous la forme de depots fibrinoides arrondis presents dans la paroi musculaire des arteres; ces depots sont la consequence de la necrose des cellules musculaires surchargees de glycolipides. chez les sujets plus âges, aux lesions de la media s'associe une endarterite, et des alterations degeneratives glomerulaires et tubulaires apparaissent, probablement secondaires aux alterations vasculaires. la necrose des cellules mesangiales peut egalement intervenir dans la genese des lesions glomerulaires. nos observations chez les heterozygotes sont compatibles avec l'hypothese de m. lyon concernant l'inactivation d'un chromosome x dans chaque cellule feminine. elles suggerent l'existence d'une correlation etroite entre l'importance de la surcharge du parenchyme renal et le taux urinaire d'α-galactosidase. elles jettent un doute sur le benefice qu'on peut attendre des therapeutiques enzymatiques substitutives.
@background ml0405 and ml2331 are antigens of mycobacterium leprae with potential for diagnosis of leprosy nerve damage is the hallmark of mycobacterium leprae infection, which results from m. leprae invasion of the schwann cell of the peripheral nervous system. we have recently shown that the laminin-2 isoform, specially the g domain of laminin alpha2 chain, on the schwann cell-axon unit serves as an initial neural target for m. leprae. however, m. leprae surface molecules that mediate bacterial invasion of peripheral nerves are entirely unknown. by using human alpha2 laminins as a probe, a major 28-kda protein in the m. leprae cell wall fraction that binds alpha2 laminins was identified. after n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, pcr-based strategy was used to clone the gene that encodes this protein. deduced amino acid sequence of this m. leprae laminin-binding protein predicts a 21-kda molecule (ml-lbp21), which is smaller than the observed molecular size in sds/page. immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy on intact m. leprae with mabs against recombinant (r) ml-lbp21 revealed that the protein is surface exposed. rml-lbp21 avidly bound to alpha2 laminins, the rg domain of the laminin-alpha2 chain, and the native peripheral nerve laminin-2. the role of ml-lbp21 in schwann cell adhesion and invasion was investigated by using fluorescent polystyrene beads coated with rml-lbp21. although beads coated with rml-lbp21 alone specifically adhered to and were ingested by primary schwann cells, these functions were significantly enhanced when beads were preincubated with exogenous alpha2 laminins. taken together, the present data suggest that ml-lbp21 may function as a critical surface adhesin that facilitates the entry of m. leprae into schwann cells.

@method gestures orchestrate brain networks for language understanding observing a speaker's mouth profoundly influences speech perception. for example, listeners perceive an "illusory" "ta" when the video of a face producing /ka/ is dubbed onto an audio /pa/. here, we show how cortical areas supporting speech production mediate this illusory percept and audiovisual (av) speech perception more generally. specifically, cortical activity during av speech perception occurs in many of the same areas that are active during speech production. we find that different perceptions of the same syllable and the perception of different syllables are associated with different distributions of activity in frontal motor areas involved in speech production. activity patterns in these frontal motor areas resulting from the illusory "ta" percept are more similar to the activity patterns evoked by av(/ta/) than they are to patterns evoked by av(/pa/) or av(/ka/). in contrast to the activity in frontal motor areas, stimulus-evoked activity for the illusory "ta" in auditory and somatosensory areas and visual areas initially resembles activity evoked by av(/pa/) and av(/ka/), respectively. ultimately, though, activity in these regions comes to resemble activity evoked by av(/ta/). together, these results suggest that av speech elicits in the listener a motor plan for the production of the phoneme that the speaker might have been attempting to produce, and that feedback in the form of efference copy from the motor system ultimately influences the phonetic interpretation.
@result three-dimensional solution structure and backbone dynamics of a variant of human interleukin-3. human interleukin 4 (il-4) has been studied by 2d and 3d nmr techniques using uniformly 15n-labeled recombinant protein. assignment of resonances for all but 3 of the 130 residues of the recombinant protein has been achieved, enabling the secondary structure of the protein to be defined. this consists of four major alpha-helical regions and one short section of double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. analysis of distance and angle restraints derived from nmr experiments has enabled the overall molecular topology to be determined. this is related to that found for other four-helix proteins but has several distinctive features including cross-linking of helices by means of three disulfide bonds and a short section of beta-sheet. the structural analysis gives support to the hypothesis that many helical cytokines have a common fold and provides a basis for understanding the biological function of il-4.
@background visual texture segregation by the chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) if a region composed of one set of texture elements is effortlessly perceived on a background composed of another set, the texture segmentation is said to occur "preattentively". if the time required to find a target item among distractor items is independent of the number of distractor items, the visual search is said to occur with all items processed "in parallel". effortless, preattentive texture segmentation and parallel visual search are sometimes assumed to be equivalent measures of the same parallel processing stage in the visual system. the demonstrations presented here show that this is not the case. parallel processing can occur with stimuli that do not support effortless texture segmentation and vice versa.
@method blood pressure response to angiotensin ii, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and polymorphisms of the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor gene in hypertensive sibling pairs the aldosterone response to infused angiotensin ii (ang ii) in patients receiving a low-salt diet has been described as an important phenotype for genetic studies on human hypertension. the objectives of the present study were to determine the parameters that influence this intermediate phenotype as a quantitative trait and to assess the importance of its familial resemblance in hypertensive sibling pairs. two hundred one white hypertensive subjects (95 families: 84 pairs and 11 trios) were selected in 3 centers. the patients followed the same protocol, which included a 4-week withdrawal period of antihypertensive therapy, a 1-week period on a low-salt diet, and a 30-minute infusion of ang ii. the increase in the aldosterone level was greater in women than in men (29.1+/-16.2 versus 18.2+/-9.6 ng/dl, p<0.0001). a strong relationship was found with age (r=-0.54, p<10(-4)) and plasma renin activity (r=0.32, p<10(-4)) in women but not in men. weak correlations of the aldosterone response to ang ii were observed for the whole set of sibling pairs (r=0.11, ns). conversely, strong sibling correlations were found among brother-brother pairs (r=0.40, n=36) and among sister-sister pairs as soon as age or menopausal status was considered. similar results were obtained when the ang i-aldosterone response was analyzed as a qualitative trait (kappa=0. 35, p<0.008 in brother-brother pairs). we conclude that age, gender, and plasma renin are strong determinants of the aldosterone response to ang ii, with strong sibling correlations in men and postmenopausal women. these relationships will have to be considered in future linkage and association studies.
@background moderate doses of conjugated linoleic acid isomers mix contribute to lowering body fat content maintaining insulin sensitivity and a noninflammatory pattern in adipose tissue in mice. adipose tissue may be the source of insulin desensitizing proinflammatory molecules that predispose to insulin resistance. this study investigated whether dietary fatty acids could attenuate the proinflammatory insulin-resistant state in obese adipose tissue. the potential antidiabetic effect of cis-9, trans-11–conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-cla) was determined, focusing on the molecular markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation in adipose tissue of ob/ob c57bl-6 mice. feeding a c9,t11-cla–enriched diet reduced fasting glucose (p < 0.05), insulin (p < 0.05), and triacylglycerol concentrations (p < 0.01) and increased adipose tissue plasma membrane glut4 (p < 0.05) and insulin receptor (p < 0.05) expression compared with the control linoleic acid–enriched diet. interestingly, after the c9,t11-cla diet, adipose tissue macrophage infiltration was less, with marked downregulation of several inflammatory markers in adipose tissue, including reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and cd68 mrna (p < 0.05), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) p65 expression (p < 0.01), nf-κb dna binding (p < 0.01), and nf-κb p65, p50, c-rel, p52, and relb transcriptional activity (p < 0.01). to define whether these observations were direct effects of the nutrient intervention, complimentary cell culture studies showed that c9,t11-cla inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α–induced downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glut4 mrna expression and promoted insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3t3-l1 adipocytes compared with linoleic acid. this study suggests that altering fatty acid composition may attenuate the proinflammatory state in adipose tissue that predisposes to obesity-induced insulin resistance.

@method mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction in cardiovascular disease relationship of hyperuricemia with mortality in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction despite advances in the treatment of heart failure (hf), which have resulted in improved survival, overall prognosis continues to be poor. given the high short-term mortality rate, it remains important to utilize assessment techniques with established prognostic value in this patient population. ideally, a given assessment should also be able to accurately reflect disease severity, a heterogeneous phenomenon in patients with hf, and accurately reflect the magnitude of physiologic/clinical improvement following the implementation or titration of an intervention. cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpx) satisfies all of the aforementioned desirable assessment attributes. peak oxygen consumption and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope are key cpx variables in assessing prognosis and gauging disease severity. given the high value of information obtained from this procedure, cpx should be considered a core assessment in the hf population. the current review will concisely define key cpx variables and summarize their clinical applications in patients with hf.
@background temporally graded activation of neocortical regions in response to memories of different ages the aim of this study was to determine the role of regional cortical thickness in recall of verbal material over an extended time period. mri scans of healthy adults of varying ages were obtained. two scans were averaged per person to achieve high spatial resolution, and a semi-automated method for continuous measurement of thickness across the entire cortical mantle was employed. verbal memory tests assessing recall after 5 min, 30 min, and a mean interval of 83 days were administered. a general linear model (glm) of the effects of thickness at each vertex on the different memory indices was computed, controlling for gender, age, iq, and intracranial volume. these analyses were repeated with hippocampal volume as an additional variable to be controlled for, to assess to which extent effects of cortical thickness were independent of hippocampal size. minute effects of cortical thickness were observed with regard to shorter time intervals (5 and 30 min). however, even when controlling for the effects of hippocampal volume, higher recall across months was associated with thicker cortex of distinct areas including parts of the gyrus rectus, the middle frontal gyrus, the parieto-occipital sulcus and the lingual gyrus of both hemispheres. in addition, hemisphere-specific associations were found in parts of the right temporal and parietal lobe as well as parts of the left precuneus. this supports a unique and critical role of the thickness of distinct cortical areas in recall after months, more than after minutes.
@method the fitness effects of synonymous mutations in dna and rna viruses. mutational fitness effects can be measured with relatively high accuracy in viruses due to their small genome size, which facilitates full-length sequencing and genetic manipulation. previous work has shown that animal and plant rna viruses are very sensitive to mutation. here, we characterize mutational fitness effects in single-stranded (ss) dna and ssrna bacterial viruses. first, we performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in which we subjected three ssdna (φx174, g4, f1) and three ssrna phages (qβ, ms2, and sp) to plaque-to-plaque transfers and chemical mutagenesis. genome sequencing and growth assays indicated that the average fitness effect of the accumulated mutations was similar in the two groups. second, we used site-directed mutagenesis to obtain 45 clones of φx174 and 42 clones of qβ carrying random single-nucleotide substitutions and assayed them for fitness. in φx174, 20% of such mutations were lethal, whereas viable ones reduced fitness by 13% on average. in qβ, these figures were 29% and 10%, respectively. it seems therefore that high mutational sensitivity is a general property of viruses with small genomes, including those infecting animals, plants, and bacteria. mutational fitness effects are important for understanding processes of fitness decline, but also of neutral evolution and adaptation. as such, these findings can contribute to explain the evolution of ssdna and ssrna viruses.
@background persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in santa monica bay beach sediments. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
@background novel mechanism of regulation of protein 4.1g binding properties through ca2+/calmodulin-mediated structural changes red blood cell protein 4.1 (4.1r) is essential for maintaining erythrocyte shape and controlling membrane mechanical properties, such as deformability and stability. the importance of 4.1r has been demonstrated by the dramatic erythrocyte alterations observed in patients lacking this protein. indeed, 4.1r null red blood cells adopt an elliptical shape and are characterized by unstable membranes. the key role of 4.1r likely results from multiple protein-protein interactions: lateral interactions with the spectrin/actin network and vertical interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins glycophorin c (gpc), band 3 (anion exchanger 1, ae1), and cd44. 4.1r promotes the formation of a ternary complex with gpc and p55 through its 30 kda membrane-binding domain. based on the primary structure of the prototypical 80 kda isoform of 4.1r, functional domains and sites for binding partners have been identified. the others and we have been focusing on the structure and function of the 30 kda nh2-terminal domain of 4.1r, which is responsible for 4.1r interaction with the transmembrane proteins described above. a major finding is that ca2+, in association with calmodulin (cam), plays a critical role in regulation of the interaction of the 30 kda domain with its various binding partners. this review is a detailed report of our current knowledge regarding 4.1r, and more specifically, 4.1r 30 kda domain: its primary structure, functions and modulation by ca2+ and cam. emphasis is given on the relationships between structure and function that we have been able to establish through x-ray crystal structure analysis of the 30 kda membrane-binding domain in 4.1r. finally, we give insights into the potential roles of 4.1r in the dynamic organization of the membrane skeleton viewed as a complex system.
@result atp-binding cassette superfamily transporter gene expression in human primary ovarian carcinoma. expression of the human mdr1 gene has been shown to confer the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype to sensitive cells. to investigate the possible contribution of the mdr phenotype to chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma, we have analyzed mdr1 gene expression in fresh carcinoma specimens from 50 patients. fifteen received chemotherapy before surgery and were judged as poor responders. thirty-five patients did not receive any drug before surgery. control tissues were lymphocytes from 7 patients. total rnas were analyzed by northern and slot blot hybridization techniques using human mdr1 complementary dna and human gamma-actin complementary dna probes sequentially as qualitative and quantitative controls. mdr1 transcripts (4.5 kilobases) were observed in the rna preparations obtained from 3 of 10 patients who were treated with doxorubicin or vincristine, 2 drugs known to select the mdr phenotype in vitro. in 40 other rna preparations obtained from 35 untreated patients and 5 patients treated exclusively with cyclophosphamide and cis-platinum, no transcript could be detected. using the exact fisher test, the difference between the 2 groups was found to be significant (p less than 0.01). the three tumors with elevated mdr1 expression did not show mdr1 dna amplification. our study suggests that, in spite of the weak occurrence of the mdr process in patients with ovarian cancers, mdr1 expression can be related to previous treatment with doxorubicin or vincristine. these results favor the expression of the mdr1 gene as one of the determinants involved in the acquired chemoresistance of ovarian cancers.
@method interpersonal emotion regulation: implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being we developed a multidimensional coping inventory to assess the different ways in which people respond to stress. five scales (of four items each) measure conceptually distinct aspects of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint coping, seeking of instrumental social support); five scales measure aspects of what might be viewed as emotional-focused coping (seeking of emotional social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, turning to religion); and three scales measure coping responses that arguably are less useful (focus on and venting of emotions, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement). study 1 reports the development of scale items. study 2 reports correlations between the various coping scales and several theoretically relevant personality measures in an effort to provide preliminary information about the inventory's convergent and discriminant validity. study 3 uses the inventory to assess coping responses among a group of undergraduates who were attempting to cope with a specific stressful episode. this study also allowed an initial examination of associations between dispositional and situational coping tendencies.
@method comparisons of local and systemic aerobic fitness parameters between finswimmers with different athlete grade levels our purpose is to compare the changes in muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (vl) and biceps brachii (bb) muscles simultaneously using near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) during incremental rowing exercise in eight rowers. based on the bb and vl muscle oxygenation patterns, two points are used to characterize the muscle oxygenation kinetics in both the arm and the leg muscles. the first point is the breaking point (bp), which refers to an accelerated fall in muscle oxygenation that correlates with the gas exchange threshold (get). the second point is the leveling-off point (lo), which suggests the upper limit of o(2) extraction. the get occurred at 63.3+/-2.4% of maximal oxygen uptake (vo(2 max)). the bp appeared at 45.0+/-3.8% and 55.6+/-2.4% vo(2 max) in the bb and vl, respectively. the lo appeared at 63.6+/-4.1% and 86.6+/-1.0% vo(2 max) in these two muscles, respectively. both the bp and the lo occurred earlier in bb compared with vl. these results suggest that arm muscles have lower oxidative capacity than leg muscles during rowing exercise. the rowers with higher exercise performances showed heavier workloads, as evaluated by bp and lo. the monitoring of muscle oxygenation by nirs in arm and leg muscles during rowing could be a useful guide for evaluation and training.
@method bioinformatic analysis of ciliary transition zone proteins reveals insights into the evolution of ciliopathy networks nephronophthisis (nphp), joubert (jbts), and meckel-gruber (mks) syndromes are autosomal-recessive ciliopathies presenting with cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebellar/neural tube malformation. whether defects in kidney, retinal, or neural disease primarily involve ciliary, hedgehog, or cell polarity pathways remains unclear. using high-confidence proteomics, we identified 850 interactors copurifying with nine nphp/jbts/mks proteins and discovered three connected modules: "nphp1-4-8" functioning at the apical surface, "nphp5-6" at centrosomes, and "mks" linked to hedgehog signaling. assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis in 3d renal cultures link renal cystic disease to apical organization defects, whereas ciliary and hedgehog pathway defects lead to retinal or neural deficits. using 38 interactors as candidates, linkage and sequencing analysis of 250 patients identified atxn10 and tctn2 as new nphp-jbts genes, and our tctn2 mouse knockout shows neural tube and hedgehog signaling defects. our study further illustrates the power of linking proteomic networks and human genetics to uncover critical disease pathways.
@method statistical mechanics and information-theoretic perspectives on complexity in the earth system entropy, as it relates to dynamical systems, is the rate of information production. methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. pincus introduced approximate entropy (apen), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. apen statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. we have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (sampen), and have compared apen and sampen by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. we have also evaluated cross-apen and cross-sampen, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. sampen agreed with theory much more closely than apen over a broad range of conditions. the improved accuracy of sampen statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.
@result effect of conceptus on transforming growth factor (tgf) β1 mrna expression and protein concentration in the porcine endometrium—in vivo and in vitro studies we examined the localization of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta in first-trimester and term human decidua and chorionic villi and explored the role of this factor on the proliferation and differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells. two antibodies, 1d11.16.8, a mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibody capable of recognizing both tgf-beta 1 and tgf-beta 2 and cl-b1/29, a rabbit polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing tgf-beta 2, were used to immunolocalize tgf-beta in fixed, paraffin-embedded, or fixed, frozen sections of placenta and decidua, providing similar results. intense labeling was observed in the extracellular matrix (ecm) of the first-trimester decidua and cytoplasm of term decidual cells. syncytiotrophoblast cell cytoplasm as well as the ecm in the core of the chorionic villi of both first-trimester and term placentas exhibited a moderate degree of labeling. strong cytoplasmic labeling was observed in the cytotrophoblastic shell of the term placenta. to examine the role of tgf-beta on trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, early passage cultures of first-trimester and primary cultures of term trophoblast cells were established and characterized on the basis of numerous immunocytochemical and functional markers. these cells expressed cytokeratin, placental alkaline phosphatase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and pregnancy-specific beta glycoprotein, but not factor viii or 63d3; they also produced hcg and collagenase type iv. exposure of first-trimester trophoblast cultures to tgf-beta 1 significantly inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. an antiproliferative effect was also noted in the presence of tgf-beta 2. these effects were abrogated in the presence of the neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody (1d11.16.8) in a concentration-dependent manner. in a 3-day culture, exogenous tgf-beta 1 stimulated formation of multinucleated cells by the first trimester as well as term trophoblast cells. addition of neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody to first-trimester trophoblast cells stimulated proliferation beyond control levels in a 24-h culture and reduced formation of multinucleated cells in a 3-day culture, indicating the presence of endogenous tgf-beta activity. these results indicate that tgf-beta produced at the human fetal-maternal interface plays a major regulatory role in the proliferation and differentiation of the trophoblast.
@background directed evolution of mycobacterium tuberculosis β-lactamase reveals gatekeeper residue that regulates antibiotic resistance and catalytic efficiency proteins are transported across the bacterial plasma membrane and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane by means of protein translocases that recognize n-terminal targeting signals in their cognate substrates. transport of many of these proteins involves the well defined sec apparatus that operates in both membranes. we describe here the identification of a novel component of a bacterial sec-independent translocase. the system probably functions in a similar manner to a sec-independent translocase in the thylakoid membrane, and substrates for both systems bear a characteristic twin-arginine motif in the targeting peptide. the translocase component is encoded inescherichia coli by an unassigned reading frame,yigu, disruption of which blocks the export of at least five twin-arg-containing precursor proteins that are predicted to bind redox cofactors, and hence fold, prior to translocation. the sec pathway remains unaffected in the deletion strain. the gene has been designated tatc (for twin-argininetranslocation), and we show that homologous genes are present in a range of bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria. these findings suggest a central role for tatc-type proteins in the translocation of tightly folded proteins across a spectrum of biological membranes.
@result polyneuropathy and myopathy in beta-thalassemia major patients thalassemia is a common genetic disorder in tunisia. early iron concentration assessment is a crucial and challenging issue. most of annual deaths due to iron overload occurred in underdeveloped regions of the world. limited access to liver and heart mri monitoring might partially explain these poor prognostic results. standard software programs are not available in tunisia. this study is the first to evaluate iron overload in heart and liver using the mri t2* with excel spreadsheet for post processing. association of this mri tool results to serum ferritin level, and echocardiography was also investigated. one hundred tunisian-transfused thalassemia patients older than 10 years (16.1 ± 5.2) were enrolled in the study. the mean myocardial iron concentration (mic) was 1.26 ± 1.65 mg/g dw (0.06–8.32). cardiac t2* (ct2*) was under 20 ms in 30 % of patients and under 10 ms in 21 % of patients. left ventricular ejection function was significantly lower in patients with ct2* <10 ms. abnormal liver iron concentration (lic >3 mg/g dw) was found in 95 % of patients. lic was over 15 mg/g dw in 25 % of patients. mic was more correlated than ct2* to lic and serum ferritin. among patients with sf <1000 μg/l, 13 % had ct2* <20 ms. our data showed that 30 % of the tunisian thalassemia major patients enrolled in this cohort had myocardial iron overload despite being treated by iron chelators. sf could not reliably predict iron overload in all thalassemia patients. mri t2* using excel spreadsheet for routine follow-up of iron overload might improve the prognosis of thalassemia major patients in developing countries, such as tunisia, where standard mri tools are not available or expensive.
@background comparison of budesonide/formoterol turbuhaler with fluticasone/salmeterol diskus for treatment effects on small airway impairment and airway inflammation in patients with asthma. aims evidence is accumulating that budesonide (bud) forms intracellular esters in airways. which may affect both duration of action and therapeutic ratio of this drug. the aim of the present paper is to review the preclinical and human experimental evidence supporting the esterification of bud, and to discuss the clinical implications this may have on asthma and rhinitis treatment.   results after inhalation, intact bud binds primarily to available steroid receptors, and mainly excess (unbound) bud is esterified. esterification of bud is a rapid process: within 20 minutes of inhalation in the rat of radiolabeled bud, approximately 80% of radioactivity within the trachea and main bronchi was associated with bud esters, primarily bud oleate. after 4 hours, the proportion of bud esters/total cellular bud was typically 40 to 50% for lung, 70 to 90% for trachea, and only 10 to 15% for peripheral muscle. comparative in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esterification prolongs bud's anti-inflammatory activity longer than that of corticosteroids that can not form esters. clinical studies have confirmed the prolonged presence of bud esters, as well as intact bud, in human airway tissues: 6 hours postdosing, nasal biopsy concentrations of intact bud were >10-fold greater than those of fluticasone propionate and at 24 hours bud was detectable in threefold more biopsies than fluticasone propionate. the impact of esterification on airway selectivity of bud has also been demonstrated in vivo and using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models.   conclusions bud is retained in airways as esters, a novel kinetic mechanism for synthetic glucocorticoids. in preclinical studies this esterification is correlated to a prolonged local tissue binding and efficacy, which is not found when the esterification is inhibited by an esterification blocker. because less esters are formed in the systemic compartment than in airways/lung, the local benefit:systemic risk ratio may also be improved by this mechanism. bud possesses favorable clinical properties, including its approved once-daily efficacy in asthma, which is probably in part attributable to esterification. however, a direct proof of the latter in patients requires effective and safe inhibitors of the esterification, which are not yet available. therefore, evidence to support the therapeutic impact of esterification is still circumstantial.
@method iga anti-b2gpi antibodies in patients with autoimmune liver diseases background primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc)-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (ama), routinely detected by indirect immunofluoresnce, immunofix various mitochondrial antigens by immunoblot (ib). we have investigated whether there is a relationship between ifl-determined ama titres and the number, intensity or pattern of ib-bands.   methods by computer-assisted imaging technology, an ib analysis using human liver mitochondrial preparation was performed in 100 ama positive pbc samples, subdivided in 5 groups each consisting of 20 cases with very high, high, intermediate, low or borderline ifl titres and in 19 ama-negative cases.   results reactivity to at least 1 mitochondrial band (range 1-12) was present in 114 (96%) cases. reactivity to the major pyruvate dehydrogenase e2-subunit 74-kda autoantigen positively correlated with ama ifl titres but was absent in 25% ifl-positive cases. the intensity and number of ib-bands differed significantly among groups (p<0.001). ifl ama titres positively correlated with the total number (r=0.8, p<0.001) and the intensity of the ib-bands (r=0.75, p<0.001).   conclusions our study indicates that ifl-determined ama relate to the number and intensity of immunofixed bands. reactivity to pdc-e2 does not correlate with ifl titres in a considerable proportion of patients suggesting that detection methods of ama need to be based in the entire spectrum of the disease-specific mitochondrial antigens.
@background transition from interictal to ictal activity in limbic networks in vitro on the basis of neuroanatomical studies, the entorhinal cortex (ec) has long been regarded as a relay station that provides the major source of afferent input to the hippocampus. the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus from layer ii has traditionally been regarded as the major pathway by which information is transferred. however, electrophysiological studies are now indicating that other elements of the perforant path that project directly to ca1 and ca3 are more important than thought previously, and that the properties of different neuronal elements in the ec may determine the way in which information is passed on to and processed by the hippocampus. this article summarizes some of the properties of synaptic transmission in the ec and speculates on how frequency-dependent changes in transmission may be involved in the pre- and post-processing of hippocampal information by the ec.
@method indole affects the formation of multicellular aggregate structures in pantoea agglomerans ys19. abstract the l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on f. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. the amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in f. nucleatum atcc 25586 was 28% identical to that deduced from tnaa in escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the β-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. the fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnab encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. the transcript started at position −68 or −153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. real-time quantitative pcr showed that much more f. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. the km and kcat of the enzyme were 0.26 ± 0.03 mm and 0.74 ± 0.04 s−1, respectively. f. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. exogenous indole also increased f. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase f. nucleatum biofilms.

@method dealing with word-internal modification and spelling variation in data-driven lemmatization we present a comparative investigation of word representations for part-of-speech (pos) and morphological tagging, focusing on scenarios with considerable differences between training and test data where a robust approach is necessary. instead of adapting the model towards a specific domain we aim to build a robust model across domains. we developed a test suite for robust tagging consisting of six languages and different domains. we find that representations similar to brown clusters perform best for pos tagging and that word representations based on linguistic morphological analyzers perform best for morphological tagging.
@method analysis of germline variants in cdh1, igfbp3, mmp1, mmp3, stk15 and vegf in familial and sporadic renal cell carcinoma the search of inherited cancer susceptibility factors is an important subject in cancer epidemiology. analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in various genes revealed a correlation between the presence of specific allelic variants and cancer predisposition in diverse malignancies. stk15 is an important protein in control of the integrity of the mitotic spindle apparatus and genomic stability. we analysed the distribution of the functionally important t91a snp in the stk15 gene in a cohort of renal cell carcinoma (rcc) patients and compared it to the distribution in a control group without malignancies. dna from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy renal tissue (rcc patients) or peripheral blood samples (control group) was isolated according to standard protocols. allelic variant of stk15 nucleotide 91 was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis. overall, 156 rcc patients and 158 patients without any malignancy were analysed. the distribution of the a/a, 7.59%). there was also no correlation between genotype and tumour grade or stage or other histopathological characteristics of the tumours. this first analysis of the stk15 t91a snp in rcc patients revealed no correlation between a certain allelic variant and an increased risk for rcc.
@background cortical mechanics and myosin-ii abnormalities associated with post-ovulatory aging: implications for functional defects in aged eggs. analysis of mouse oocyte mechanics shows that effective tension drops 6-fold from prophase i to metaphase ii; the metaphase ii egg has a 2.5-fold tension differential between the cortex over the spindle and the opposite cortex. manipulation of actin, myosin-ii, or erms alters tension levels and induces spindle abnormalities during meiosis ii.
@result measuring mindfulness: a rasch analysis of the freiburg mindfulness inventory mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. this research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. the development and psychometric properties of the dispositional mindful attention awareness scale (maas) are described. correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the maas measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. an experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.
@method a comparative study of an innate immune response in lamprologine cichlid fishes many studies have attempted to explain the evolution of cooperation, yet little attention has been paid to what factors control the amount or kind of cooperation performed. kin selection theory suggests that more cooperation, or help, should be given by relatives. however, recent theory suggests that under specific ecological and demographic conditions, unrelated individuals must ‘pay to stay’ in the group and therefore may help more. we tested these contrasting predictions using the cooperatively breeding fish, neolamprologus pulcher, and found that the degree of work effort by helpers depended on which helping behaviours were considered and on their level of relatedness to the breeding male or female. in the field, helpers unrelated to the breeding male performed more territory defence, while helpers unrelated to the breeding female contributed less to territory defence. in the laboratory, unrelated group members helped more. our work demonstrates that a number of factors in addition to kinship shape cooperative investment patterns.
@method influence of the characteristics of japanese patients on the long-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement: results of a microsimulation background the second-generation carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (edwards lifesciences llc, irvine, ca) is widely used for aortic valve replacement. however, knowledge on the long-term outcomes of patients after valve implantation is incomplete. we used microsimulation to calculate the long-term outcome of any given patient after aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve.   methods a meta-analysis of 8 reports on aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (2,685 patients; 12,250 patient years) was used to estimate the hazards of valve-related events other than structural valvular deterioration. structural valvular deterioration was described by age-dependent weibull curves calculated from 18-year follow-up, premarket approval, carpentier-edwards pericardial primary data. these estimates provided the input data for the parameters of the microsimulation model, which was then used to calculate the outcomes of patients of different ages after valve implantation. the model estimates of survival were validated using two external data sets.   results the weibull analysis estimated a median time to reoperation for structural valvular deterioration ranging from 18.1 years for a 55-year-old male to 23.2 years for a 75-year-old male. for a 65-year-old male, microsimulation calculated a life expectancy and event-free life expectancy of 10.8 and 9.1 years, respectively. the lifetime risk of at least one valve-related event was 38% and that of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration 17%, respectively, for this patient. the model estimates of survival showed good agreement with external data.   conclusions microsimulation provides detailed insight into the long-term prognosis of patients after aortic valve replacement. the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve performs satisfactorily and offers a low lifetime risk of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration, especially for elderly patients requiring aortic valve replacement.
@background two-year clinical outcomes after paclitaxel-eluting stent or brachytherapy treatment for bare metal stent restenosis: the taxus v isr trial. background treatment of in-stent restenosis presents a critical limitation of intracoronary stent implantation. ionizing radiation has been shown to decrease neointimal formation within stents in animal models and in initial clinical trials. we studied the effects of intracoronary gamma-radiation therapy versus placebo on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis.   methods and results one hundred thirty patients with in-stent restenosis underwent successful coronary intervention and were then blindly randomized to receive either intracoronary gamma-radiation with (192)ir (15 gy) or placebo. four independent core laboratories blinded to the treatment protocol analyzed the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound end points of restenosis. procedural success and in-hospital and 30-day complications were similar among the groups. at 6 months, patients assigned to radiation therapy required less target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization (9 [13.8%] and 17 [26.2%], respectively) compared with patients assigned to placebo (41 [63.1%, p=0.0001] and 44 [67.7%, p=0.0001], respectively). binary angiographic restenosis was lower in the irradiated group (19% versus 58% for placebo, p=0.001). freedom from major cardiac events was lower in the radiation group (29.2% versus 67.7% for placebo, p<0.001).   conclusions intracoronary gamma-radiation used as adjunct therapy for patients with in-stent restenosis significantly reduces both angiographic and clinical restenosis.
@method differential proinflammatory and prooxidant effects of bone morphogenetic protein-4 in coronary and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. objective—bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bmp-4) is a transforming growth factor &bgr; family member cytokine that exerts proinflammatory effects on the endothelium and is likely to play a role in atherogenesis. recent studies suggested that atheroprotective levels of shear stress control endothelial bmp-4 expression; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. methods and results—we found that shear stress downregulated bmp-4 expression in human and rat coronary arterial endothelial cells (caecs) as well as in cultured mesenteric arterioles, although it had no effect on the expression of bmp-2, a related cytokine. in human coronary arterial endothelial cells, 8-bromo-camp, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or a camp-dependent protein kinase (pka) activator effectively decreased bmp-4 expression, mimicking the effects of shear stress. indeed, shear stress induced the nuclear translocation of pka-c, and inhibition of pka attenuated the effects of shear stress and forskolin on bmp-4 expression. rna decay assay and bmp-4 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene assay showed that camp regulates bmp-4 expression at the transcriptional level. conclusions—laminar shear stress and the camp/pka pathway are important negative regulators of bmp-4 expression in the vascular endothelium. because bmp-4 elicits endothelial activation and dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular calcification, inhibition of bmp-4 expression by shear stress and the camp/pka pathway is likely to exert antiatherogenic and vasculoprotective effects.
@background dopaminergic modulation of auditory cortex-dependent memory consolidation through mtor bilateral rapid‐rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) of gerbil auditory cortex with a miniature coil device was used to study short‐term and long‐term effects on discrimination learning of frequency‐modulated tones. we found previously that directional discrimination of frequency modulation (rising vs. falling) relies on auditory cortex processing and that formation of its memory depends on local protein synthesis. here we show that, during training over 5 days, certain rtms regimes contingent on training had differential effects on the time course of learning. when rtms was applied several times per day, i.e. four blocks of 5 min rtms each followed 5 min later by a 3‐min training block and 15‐min intervals between these blocks (experiment a), animals reached a high discrimination performance more slowly over 5 days than did controls. when rtms preceded only the first two of four training blocks (experiment b), or when prolonged rtms (20 min) preceded only the first block, or when blocks of experiment a had longer intervals (experiments c and d), no significant day‐to‐day effects were found. however, in experiment a, and to some extent in experiment b, rtms reduced the within‐session discrimination performance. nevertheless the animals learned, as demonstrated by a higher performance the next day. thus, our results indicate that rtms treatments accumulate over a day but not strongly over successive days. we suggest that rtms of sensory cortex, as used in our study, affects short‐term memory but not long‐term memory formation.
@background social networking and academic performance: a review the quantitative study to explore the most popular amongst saudi students.the study establishes relation among the social media usage and academic grades.poor time management and football also have negative impact on academic grades.normality tests are to find relationship among social media usage and gpa scores.the hypothesis about existence of relationship among gpa and sn is not satisfied. social media is a popular method for communication amongst university students in saudi arabia. however excessive social media use can raise questions about whether academic performance is affected. this research explores this question by conducting a survey on university students in saudi arabia in regards to social media usage and their academic performance. the survey also explored which social network is the most popular amongst saudi students, what students thought about their social media usage and factors besides social media usage which negatively affect academic performance.the survey received 108 responses and descriptive statistics including normality tests i.e. scatter plots were used to examine the relationship between the average number of hours students spent of social media a week and gpa scores of the students. the results demonstrated that there was no linear relationship between social media usage in a week and gpa score. students highlighted that besides social media use, time management is a factor which affects students 'studies negatively.the findings of the paper can be used to propose the effective plans for improving the academic performance of the students in such a way that a balance in the leisure, information exchange and academic performance can be maintained.
@background atrx loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining dna repair in glioma glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
@background scholarlycommons departmental papers ( be ) department of bioengineering may 2006 e-cadherin engagement stimulates proliferation via rac 1 conclusionscontact inhibition of movement is here defined simply as the stopping of the continued locomotion of a cell in the direction which has produced a collision with another cell; so that one cell does not use another as a substratum. amongst fibroblasts and epithelial cells this inhibition seems to be brought about by a mechanism which it is suggested consists essentially of a spasm of contraction in the region of the contact, set off by some signal from the cell contacted. many other kinds of cells show the general phenomenon of contact inhibition; but there is no certainty that they have the same contractile mechanism.the survey of the literature which this review has entailed suggests that it might be useful to end with four somewhat negative points: (1) contact inhibition as originally defined is not concerned with mitosis. it may of course become so. (2) contact inhibition of movement is difficult to analyse reliably without quantitative estimations and deliberate experiments. anecdotes are not enough. (3) malignant cells are not properly described as being devoid of contact inhibition. it is suggested that they are defective as compared with their cells of origin. (4) from the point of view invasion interest. it is the heterologous inhibition of tumour cells by normal cells that is relevant.
@method molecular and phenotypic characterization revealed six colletotrichum species responsible for anthracnose disease of small cardamom in south india we have designed two taxon‐selective primers for the internal transcribed spacer (its) region in the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit. these primers, its1‐f and its4‐b, were intended to be specific to fungi and basidiomycetes, respectively. we have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. our results showed that its4‐b, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer its1 or the fungal‐specific primer its1‐f, efficiently amplified dna from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete dnas. the results with plants were not as clearcut. the its1‐f/its4‐b primer pair produced a small amount of pcr product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ its primers. however, under conditions where both plant and fungal dnas were present, the fungal dna was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant dna. its1‐f/its4‐b preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues. these primers can be used to study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of rusts on alternate hosts.
@background waist circumference cut-off values for the prediction of cardiovascular risk factors clustering in chinese school-aged children: a cross-sectional study objective: the objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that differences in the relationship between percent body fat (%bf) and body mass index (bmi) between populations can be explained (in part) by differences in body build.design: cross-sectional, comparative study.subjects: 120 age, gender and bmi matched singapore chinese, beijing chinese and dutch (wageningen) caucasians.measurements: from body weight and body height, bmi was calculated. relative sitting height (sitting height/height) was used as a measure of relative leg length. body fat was determined using densitometry (underwater weighing) in beijing and wageningen and using a three-compartment model based on densitometry and hydrometry in singapore. wrist and knee widths were measured as indicators for frame size and skeletal mass was calculated based on height, wrist and knee width. in addition, a slenderness index (height/sum of wrist and knee width) was calculated.results: for the same bmi, singapore chinese had the highest %bf followed by beijing chinese and the dutch caucasians. singaporean chinese had a more slender frame than beijing chinese and dutch caucasians. predicted %bf from bmi, using a caucasian prediction formula, was not different from measured %bf in wageningen and in beijing, but in singapore the formula underpredicted %bf by 4.0±0.8% (mean±s.e.m.) compared to wageningen. the difference between measured and predicted %bf (bias) was related to the level of %bf and with measures of body build, especially slenderness. correction for differences in %bf, slenderness and relative sitting height, decreased the differences between measured and predicted values compared to the dutch group from 1.4±0.8 (not statistically significant, ns) to −0.2±0.5 (ns) in beijing and from 4.0±0.8 (p<0.05) to 0.3±0.5 (ns) in singapore (all values mean±s.e.m.).conclusions: the study results confirm the hypothesis that differences in body build are at least partly responsible for a different relationship between bmi and %bf among different (ethnic) groups.
@result identification of quantitative trait loci affecting ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in an interspecific f1 poplar cross and differential expression of genes in ectomycorrhizas of the two parents: populus deltoides and populus trichocarpa truffles are symbiotic fungi that form ectomycorrhizas with plant roots. here we present evidence that at an early stage of the interaction, i.e. prior to physical contact, mycelia of the white truffle tuber borchii and the black truffle tuber melanopsorum induce alterations in root morphology of the host cistus incanus and the nonhost arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana; i.e. primary root shortening, lateral root formation, root hair stimulation). this was most likely due to the production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) and ethylene by the mycelium. application of a mixture of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and iaa fully mimicked the root morphology induced by the mycelium for both host and nonhost plants. application of the single hormones only partially mimicked it. furthermore, primary root growth was not inhibited in the arabidopsis auxin transport mutant aux1-7 by truffle metabolites while root branching was less effected in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2-lh. the double mutant aux1-7;ein2-lh displayed reduced sensitivity to fungus-induced primary root shortening and branching. in agreement with the signaling nature of truffle metabolites, increased expression of the auxin response reporter dr5∷gfp in arabidopsis root meristems subjected to the mycelium could be observed, confirming that truffles modify the endogenous hormonal balance of plants. last, we demonstrate that truffles synthesize ethylene from l-methionine probably through the α-keto-γ-(methylthio)butyric acid pathway. taken together, these results establish the central role of iaa and ethylene as signal molecules in truffle/plant interactions.
@method molecular analysis of dengue virus attenuation after serial passage in primary dog kidney cells. virion rnas of 12 geographically distinct dengue type 1 (den-1) virus isolates were clearly unique by rna fingerprinting. isolates from the same geographic area were very similar but differed from those of other areas, allowing us to establish three geographical groupings based upon percent shared oligonucleotides. three caribbean strains were virtually identical (85-91% homologous oligonucleotides) whereas pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited considerably less homology to one another (44-49%). the pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited little relationship (20-30%) to the caribbean and african strains. a sri lankan isolate displayed a relatively high degree of homology to nigerian isolates (60-66% homologous oligonucleotides), suggesting that the sri lanka den-1 infection originated from africa. a 1978 nigerian den-1 isolate and the 1969 sri lankan strain each exhibited greater than 50% homology with a 1977 jamaican strain. the similarities observed between the african/sri lankan and jamaican strains suggest that the den-1 virus which caused the 1977 jamaican epidemic may have originated from africa or sri lanka. the rna fingerprint is a unique characteristic of den-1 strains from a particular geographic region, suggesting this technique as a useful tool for dengue epidemiological investigations.
@background diabetic retinopathy and peripapillary retinal thickness purpose to assess the correlation between the features of optical coherence tomography (oct) and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema.   design retrospective observational case series.   methods this study involved 145 eyes (91 patients) with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the fluorescein angiography features were categorized into focal leakage type, diffuse leakage type, and diffuse cystoid leakage type. the oct features were categorized into four types: type 1, thickening with homogeneous optical reflectivity; type 2, thickening with markedly decreased optical reflectivity in the outer retinal layer; type 3a, foveolar detachment without traction; and type 3b, foveolar detachment with apparent vitreofoveal traction. the correlation between fluorescein angiography types and oct types were analyzed, and their associations with visual acuity, central foveal thickness. and stages of diabetic retinopathy were evaluated.   results the prevalence of oct type 1 was higher in the focal leakage type (73.0%) and in the diffuse leakage type (58.9%) than in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (3.8%) of fluorescein angiography (p <.0001). the prevalence of oct type 2 and 3a was higher in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (57.7% and 34.6%, respectively) than in the focal leakage type (20.6% and 3.2%) or diffuse leakage type(28.6% and 10.7%; p <.0001). the stages of retinopathy correlated with fluorescein angiography types (p =.016). optical coherence tomography type 1 and the focal leakage type of fluorescein angiography showed the least foveal thickness and the best visual acuity (p <.05).   conclusions there was a significant correlation between the features of oct and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the combined data from both oct and fluorescein angiography may provide a clearer understanding of the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of clinically significant diabetic macular edema.
@background the effect of contralateral training: influence of unilateral isokinetic exercise on one-legged standing balance of the contralateral lower extremity in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate balance abilities and electromyographic (emg) latency times of the preferred and nonpreferred leg in soccer players. whereas side differences between the two legs in force, kicking speed, and joint laxity have been demonstrated in athletes in previous studies, no data are so far available on balance differences. low balance ability is generally associated with an increased risk of ligament injuries, and the detection of a possible asymmetry in balance is important because a bilateral difference may be a contributing factor to injury. twenty-one amateur soccer players were tested. two different balance test instruments were used: the biodex stability system and the tetrax system. for the evaluation of muscle latency times, emgs were recorded by means of the equitest system. none of the tests performed in this study revealed statistically significant differences in balance ability between the preferred and the nonpreferred leg. the investigations of balance function and muscle response in amateur soccer players did not reveal significant differences between the preferred and nonpreferred leg in the current study. however, a certain tendency to better balance in the nonpreferred leg was observed.
@background udp-induced relaxation is enhanced in aorta from female obese otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty rats vascular dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of systemic complications associated with arterial hypertension and diabetes. the endothelium, or more specifically, various factors derived from endothelial cells tightly regulate vascular function, including vascular tone. in physiological conditions, there is a balance between endothelium‐derived factors, that is, relaxing factors (endothelium‐derived relaxing factors; edrfs) and contracting factors (endothelium‐derived contracting factors; edcfs), which mediate vascular homeostasis. however, in disease states, such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, there is an imbalance between edrf and edcf, with a reduction of edrf signalling and an increase of edcf signalling. among edcfs, cox‐derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids play an important role in the development of vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. moreover, uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (up4a), identified as an edcf in 2005, also modulates vascular function. however, the role of up4a in hypertension‐ and diabetes‐associated vascular dysfunction is unclear. in the present review, we focused on experimental and clinical evidence that implicate these two edcfs (vasoconstrictor prostanoids and up4a) in vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes.
@method increased levels of circulating microparticles in primary sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and relation with disease activity objective to determine the cellular origin of synovial microparticles, their procoagulant properties, and their relationship to local hypercoagulation.   methods microparticles in synovial fluid and plasma from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra; n = 10) and patients with other forms of arthritis (non-ra; n = 10) and in plasma from healthy subjects (n = 20) were isolated by centrifugation. microparticles were identified by flow cytometry. the ability of microparticles to support coagulation was determined in normal plasma. concentrations of prothrombin fragment f(1+2) (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [elisa]) and thrombin-antithrombin (tat) complexes (by elisa) were determined as estimates of the coagulation activation status in vivo.   results plasma from patients and healthy controls contained comparable numbers of microparticles, which originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles from ra patients and non-ra patients originated mainly from monocytes and granulocytes; few originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles bound less annexin v (which binds to negatively charged phospholipids) than did plasma microparticles, exposed tissue factor, and supported thrombin generation via factor vii. f(1+2) (median 66 nm) and tat complex (median 710 microg/liter) concentrations were elevated in synovial fluid compared with plasma from the patients (1.6 nm and 7.0 microg/liter, respectively) as well as the controls (1.0 nm and 2.9 microg/liter, respectively).   conclusion synovial fluid contains high numbers of microparticles derived from leukocytes that are strongly coagulant via the factor vii-dependent pathway. we propose that these microparticles contribute to the local hypercoagulation and fibrin deposition in inflamed joints of patients with ra and other arthritic disorders.
@result divergent androgen regulation of unfolded protein response pathways drives prostate cancer the neuroectodermal tumors neuroblastoma and melanoma represent biologically aggressive and chemoresistant cancers. the chemotherapeutic agents fenretinide and bortezomib induce apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress in these tumor types. the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the early events of er stress signaling and response pathways induced by fenretinide and bortezomib are mediated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eif2α)-atf4 signaling pathway. treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines with fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin resulted in induction of eif2α signaling, characterized by increased expression of phosphorylated eif2α, atf4, atf3, and gadd34. these events correlated with induction of the pro-apoptotic protein noxa. the cytotoxic response, characterized by up-regulation of noxa and cell death, was dependent on atf4, but not the er-related pro-death signaling pathways involving gadd153 or ire1. although perk-dependent phosphorylation of eif2α enhanced atf4 protein levels during er stress, cell death in response to fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin was not abrogated by inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation through perk knockdown or overexpression of wild-type eif2α. furthermore, atf4 induction in response to er stress was dependent primarily on transcriptional activation, which occurred in a perk- and phosphorylated eif2α-independent manner. these results demonstrate that atf4 mediates er stress-induced cell death of neuroectodermal tumor cells in response to fenretinide or bortezomib. understanding the complex regulation of cell death pathways in response to er stress-inducing drugs has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets, thus allowing the development of improved treatment strategies to overcome chemoresistance.
@background documentation and quantitative analysis of the local knowledge on medicinal plants in kalrayan hills of villupuram district, tamil nadu, india. ethnomedicinal relevance medicinal plants are treasure of any region for ailment treatment. the present research work was focused to document the indigenous knowledge of unexplored area of wana, south waziristan agency, pakistan. this was the very first study, to explore the potential ethno-medicinal plants of study area.   materials and methods data was collected by opting people participation involving interviews, group meetings, semi structured discussions and filling of questionnaires.   results and discussion a total 50 wild medicinal plants belonging to 30 families were collected. medicinal plants used against the stomach disorders were 10% followed by the cold/cough (8%), hepatitis (7%), diuretic (7%), sedative/narcotic (7%), tonic (6%), asthma (5%), cardiac problems (4%), jaundice (4%) and so on. among plant parts used for indigenous medicines, leaves were (24%) followed by the fruit (15%), root (12%), seed (11%), whole plant (9%), arial parts (8%), flower (6%), rhizome, bark and stem (4%), bulbs (2%) and pods (1%). xanthium strumarium reported the highest use value i.e. 0.95.   conclusion people of wana still rely on indigenous plants for their basic healthcare needs. harvesting of roots and whole plants is a big threat to conservation of medicinal plants diversity.
@method sense of coherence as an independent predictor of health-related quality of life among coronary heart disease patients the attention to patient outcome has nowadays extended from morbidity and mortality to an aspect of patients' benefits in terms of quality of life. one factor crucial for quality of life is coping capacity, in this study represented by the sense of coherence concept. physical status and emotional state (often measured by comprehensive instruments not always suitable for clinical use) are also additionally used to reflect quality of life. the purpose was therefore to study sense of coherence and emotional state as indirect measures of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. one hundred and eleven patients were studied by a developed questionnaire on five occasions in relation to the surgery: the week before the angiography, the day before surgery and then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. the main findings were: (1) the sense of coherence was changed (more than +/-10%) from before to 1 year after surgery in 41% of the patients, which is contrary to the theory of sense of coherence as a stable personality characteristic in adults. (2) experience of depressed mood, stress, and anxiety decreased significantly from before to after surgery. (3) beneficial outcome with regard to sense of coherence was significantly related to less experience of loneliness, depressed mood, stress and anxiety, and to less experience of chest pain 1 year after surgery. in conclusion, sense of coherence and emotional state variables, are suggested to be valuable as measurements of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
@background left ventricular function and remodeling after myocardial infarction in aging rats. this study was designed to answer two questions. first, does the left ventricular contractile dysfunction resulting from mitral regurgitation (mr) reflect a primary defect in the cardiac muscle cell? second, what is the basis for any change in cellular contractile function that might be observed? left ventricular volume overload was produced in 10 dogs by catheter transection of mitral chordae tendineae. three months later in these and in seven control dogs, left ventricular contractile function was characterized by the end-ejection stress-volume relation (eesvr). investigators who were blinded to these results then characterized the contractile performance of cardiac muscle cells, or cardiocytes, from these same left ventricles in terms of the viscosity (graded external load)-velocity relation. finally, the tissue and cellular components of these same left ventricles were analyzed morphometrically. both the left ventricles from the mr group and their constituent cardiocytes showed marked contractile abnormalities. by matching ventricles with cells from the same mr dogs, ventricular eesvr was correlated with cardiocyte peak sarcomere shortening velocity (ssv). the correlation coefficient between eesvr and ssv was 0.63, but between a size-independent measure of active ventricular stiffness and ssv, it was 0.88. no change in left ventricular interstitial volume fraction was found in mr dogs, but both ventricular and cellular contractile dysfunction strongly correlated with a decreased volume fraction of cardiocyte myofibrils. last, in an attempt to relate the degree of contractile dysfunction to the hypertrophic response, left ventricular mass in the mr dogs was correlated with both cellular and ventricular contractile indexes; no significant correlation was found. three conclusions are warranted by these studies. first, chronic left ventricular volume overload from mitral regurgitation leads to contractile defects at both the ventricular and cellular levels, the extent of which correlates well in individual animals. second, no quantitative interstitial change resulted from mr. taken together, these two findings strongly suggest that the contractile defect is intrinsic to the cardiocyte. third, while the contractile abnormality in mr remains undefined, the most basic defects appear to be a combination of myofibrillar loss with the failure of compensatory hypertrophy to occur in response to progressive decrements in cellular and ventricular function.
@method magnetic resonance imaging determined visceral fat reduction associates with enhanced il-10 plasma levels in calorie restricted obese subjects the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (quicki) has an excellent linear correlation with the glucose clamp index of insulin sensitivity (si(clamp)) that is better than that of many other surrogate indexes. however, correlation between a surrogate and reference standard may improve as variability between subjects in a cohort increases (i.e., with an increased range of values). correlation may be excellent even when prediction of reference values by the surrogate is poor. thus, it is important to evaluate the ability of quicki to accurately predict insulin sensitivity as determined by the reference glucose clamp method. in the present study, we used a calibration model to compare the ability of quicki and other simple surrogates to predict si(clamp). predictive accuracy was evaluated by both root mean squared error of prediction as well as a more robust leave-one-out cross-validation-type root mean squared error of prediction (cvpe). based on data from 116 glucose clamps obtained from nonobese, obese, type 2 diabetic, and hypertensive subjects, we found that quicki and log (homeostasis model assessment [homa]) were both excellent at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.45 and 1.51, respectively) and significantly better than homa, 1/homa, and fasting insulin (cvpe = 3.17, p < 0.001; 1.67, p < 0.02; and 2.85, p < 0.001, respectively). quicki and log(homa) also had the narrowest distribution of residuals (measured si(clamp) - predicted si(clamp)). in a subset of subjects (n = 78) who also underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis, quicki was significantly better than the minimal model index of insulin sensitivity (si(mm)) at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.54 vs. 1.98, p = 0.001). we conclude that quicki and log(homa) are among the most accurate surrogate indexes for determining insulin sensitivity in humans.
@result double‐blind, placebo‐controlled pilot study of adjunctive quetiapine sr in the treatment of pms/pmdd premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, characterized by depressive, anxious, and somatic symptoms, associated to a significant reduction in social functioning and quality of life. although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and oral contraceptives show a substantial effectiveness in pmdd, a wide percentage of women affected by pmdd do not respond to those first-line treatments. we present the case of a 42-year-old woman, affected by a disabling form of pmdd, who partially responded to an ssri treatment and significantly improved after an add-on therapy with lamotrigine. we therefore suggest that lamotrigine may be an efficacious and safe augmentation strategy in severe pmdd cases showing unsatisfactory or partial response to ssri treatments.
@method factors which affect the depression of mothers with cerebral palsy child purpose. disability in a child affects not only the child's life but also the family's life. the aim of our study is to verify the quality of life (qol) of mothers of disabled children with cerebral palsy (cp) with epilepsy compared with non-epilepsy children evaluated in a brazilian center. methods. thirty mothers of disabled children participated in the study. the control group comprised of 18 healthy mothers of children without disabilities. all mothers agreed to participate in the study. they completed the evaluation forms of the sf-36 health survey, a well-documented, self-administered qol scoring system. results. the results of our study support the premise that mothers of children with cp, as a group, have poorer qol than mothers of not disabled children. conclusions. we also observed that mothers of children with cp and epilepsy have poorer qol than mothers of children with cp without epilepsy.
@result enhanced glucotropaeolin production in hairy root cultures  of tropaeolum majus l. by combining elicitation  and precursor feeding we obtained callus, cell suspension and hairy root cultures of tropaeolum majus and we demonstrated their ability to produce glucotropaeolin and myrosinase. in hairy roots glucotropaeolin content and myrosinase activity were higher in comparison with callus, cell suspension and leaves of intact plants. in hairy root cultures the highest glucotropaeolin contents were detected on the 9th day of culture. in relation to dry weight glucotropaeolin production by hairy roots was stimulated markedly by cystein and less by phenylalanine and methyl jasmonate. cystein inhibited biomass growth so in relation to culture volume stimulating effect of cystein on glucotropaeolin yield declined. myrosinase activity was stimulated by methyl jasmonate. the ratio of myrosinase activity to glucotropaeolin content in cultures with methyl jasmonate was much higher than in cultures with cystein.
@background attenuation estimations using envelope echo data: analysis and simulations. a comparison is made between pulse echo response profiles obtained in water and profiles obtained in a tissue‐mimicking (tm) material for clinical ultrasound transducers. the tm material is assumed to provide a more accurate indication of actual beam profiles in soft tissue because of the presence of frequency‐dependent attenuation in the material. pulse echo response profiles measured in the tm medium demonstrate a reduction in the focal distance and degraded resolution distal to the focal distance, in comparison to profiles obtained in water.

@background inhibition of toll-like receptor signaling in primary murine microglia recent studies indicate that tlrs are critical in generating innate immune responses during infection with hsv-1. in this study, we investigated the role of tlr2 signaling in regulating the production of neuroimmune mediators by examining cytokine and chemokine expression using primary microglial cells obtained from tlr2−/− as well as wild-type mice. data presented here demonstrate that tlr2 signaling is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines: tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, il-12, ccl7, ccl8, ccl9, cxcl1, cxcl2, cxcl4, and cxcl5. cxcl9 and cxcl10 were also induced by hsv, but their production was not dependent upon tlr2 signaling. because tlr2−/− mice display significantly reduced mortality and diminished neuroinflammation in response to brain infection with hsv, the tlr2-dependent cytokines identified here might function as key players influencing viral neuropathogenesis.
@method a small multifunctional pentatricopeptide repeat protein in the chloroplast of chlamydomonas reinhardtii. abstract chloroplast translation is mediated by nucleus-encoded factors that interact with distinct cis-acting rna elements. a u-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region of the psbd mrna has previously been shown to be required for its translation inchlamydomonas reinhardtii. by using uv cross-linking assays, we have identified a 40-kda rna binding protein, which binds to the wild-type psbd leader, but is unable to recognize a nonfunctional leader mutant lacking the u-rich motif. rna binding is restored in a chloroplast cis-acting suppressor. the functions of several site-directed psbd leader mutants were analyzed with transgenic c. reinhardtii chloroplasts and the in vitro rna binding assay. a clear correlation between photosynthetic activity and the capability to bind rna by the 40-kda protein was observed. furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the poly(u) region serves as a molecular spacer between two previously characterized cis-acting elements, which are involved in rna stabilization and translation. rna-protein complex formation depends on the nuclear nac2 gene product that is part of a protein complex required for the stabilization of the psbdmrna. the sedimentation properties of the 40-kda rna binding protein suggest that it interacts directly with this nac2 complex and, as a result, links processes of chloroplast rna metabolism and translation.
@method power aware chain routing protocol for data gathering in sensor networks networking together hundreds or thousands of cheap microsensor nodes allows users to accurately monitor a remote environment by intelligently combining the data from the individual nodes. these networks require robust wireless communication protocols that are energy efficient and provide low latency. we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (leach), a protocol architecture for microsensor networks that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with application-specific data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system lifetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. leach includes a new, distributed cluster formation technique that enables self-organization of large numbers of nodes, algorithms for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes, and techniques to enable distributed signal processing to save communication resources. our results show that leach can improve system lifetime by an order of magnitude compared with general-purpose multihop approaches.
@background biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise of the membrane potential by sodium channel inactivation or subthreshold axonal potassium current the exact site of initiation and shape of action potentials vary among different neuronal types. the reason for this variability is largely unknown, but the subunit composition, density and distribution of voltage-gated sodium (nav) and potassium (kv) channels within the axon initial segment (ais) are likely to play a key role. here, we asked how heterogeneous are the density and distribution of nav and kv channels within the aiss of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. most of the studied cell types expressed a high density of nav1.6, kv1.1, and kv1.2 subunits in their ais, but the nav1.1 subunit could only be detected in gabaergic interneurons. a proximo-distal gradient in the density of these subunits was observed within the ais of certain nerve cells but not in others. for example, a gradual increase of the nav1.6 subunit was observed in cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell (pc) aiss, whereas its density was rather uniform in layer 5 pc aiss. the nav1.1 subunit was distributed evenly along the ais of short-axon cells of the main olfactory bulb but was restricted to the proximal part of the ais in cortical and cerebellar interneurons. our results reveal a cell type-dependent expression of sodium and potassium channel subunits with varying densities along the proximo-distal axis of the aiss. this precise arrangement is likely to contribute to the diversity of firing properties observed among central neurons.
@background development of cross-resistance by aspergillus fumigatus to clinical azoles following exposure to prochloraz, an agricultural azole aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitously distributed opportunistic pathogen, is the global leading cause of aspergillosis and causes one of the highest numbers of deaths among patients with fungal infections [1]. invasive aspergillosis is the most severe manifestation with an overall annual incidence up to 10% in immunosuppressed patients, whereas chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects about 3 million, primarily immunocompetent, individuals each year [2]. three triazole antifungals, namely itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, are recommended first-line drugs in the treatment and prophylaxis of aspergillosis [3]. however, azole resistance in a. fumigatus isolates is increasingly reported with variable prevalence in europe, the united states, south america, china, japan, iran, and india [4]–[9]. for example, about 10% of strains of a. fumigatus from the netherlands are itraconazole resistant, and in the united kingdom, the frequency increased from 0%–5% during 2002–2004 to 17%–20% in 2007–2009 [10]–[13]. in the artemis global surveillance program involving 62 medical centers, 5.8% of a. fumigatus strains showed elevated mics to one or more triazoles [5]. similarly, the prospective scare (surveillance collaboration on aspergillus resistance in europe) study involving 22 medical centers in 19 countries identified an overall prevalence of 3.4% azole resistance. azole-resistant a. fumigatus (araf) ranged from 0% to 26% among the 22 centres and was detected in 11 (57.9%) of the 19 participating european countries [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. interestingly, almost half (48.9%) of the araf isolates from the scare network in european countries were resistant to multiple azoles and harbored the tr34/l98h mutation in the cyp51a gene [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. indeed, multi-azole resistance in a. fumigatus due to the tr34/l98h mutations has become an emerging problem in both europe and asia and has been associated with high rates of treatment failures [12]–[14].    azole antifungal drugs inhibit the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, specifically the cytochrome p450 sterol 14-α-demethylase encoded by the cyp51a gene, which leads to depletion of ergosterol and accumulation of toxic sterols. the majority of araf isolates contain alterations in the target enzyme and the mutated target showed reduced or no binding to the drugs [15]. while most mutations in araf isolates were single nucleotide substitutions in the target gene (cyp51a), mutations at other genes such as the cdr1b have also been reported. for example, in the united kingdom the frequency of araf isolates without cyp51a mutations has been reported to be more than 50% [16].
@result validity of italian version of the child perceptions questionnaire (cpq11-14) backgroundoral-health-related quality of life (ohrqol) instruments are being used with increasing frequency in oral health surveys. however, these instruments are not available in all countries or all languages. the availability of cross-culturally valid, multi-lingual versions of instruments is important for epidemiological research. the child perceptions questionnaire 11–14 (cpq11–14) is an ohrqol instrument that assesses the impact of oral conditions on the quality of life of children and adolescents. the objective of the current study was to carry out the cross-cultural adaptation of cpq11–14 for the brazilian portuguese language.methodsafter translation and cross-cultural adaptation, the cpq 11–14 was tested on 160 11-to-14-year-old children who were clinically and radiographically examined for the presence or absence of dental caries. the children were receiving dental care at the pediatric dental and orthodontic clinics of the federal university of minas gerais, brazil. to test the quality of the translation, 17 children answered the questionnaire. the internal consistency of the instrument was assessed by cronbach's alpha coefficient and the test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (icc).resultsthe mean cpq11–14 score were 24.5 [standard deviation (sd) 18.27] in the group with caries and 12.89 [sd 10.95] in the group without caries. median scores were 20 and 10 in the groups with and without caries, respectively (p < 0.001). significant associations were identified between caries status and all cpq domains (p < 0.05). internal reliability was confirmed by a cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.86. test-retest reliability revealed satisfactory reproducibility (icc = 0.85). the questionnaire proved to be a valid instrument. construct validity was satisfactory, demonstrating highly significant correlations with global indicators for the total scale and subscales. the cpq11–14 score was able to discriminate between different oral conditions (groups without and with untreated caries).conclusionthe present study demonstrated that the cpq11–14 is applicable to children in brazil. it has satisfactory psychometric properties, but further research is required to evaluate these properties in a population study.
@method expression of an escherichia coli phosphoglucomutase in potato (solanum tuberosum l.) results in minor changes in tuber metabolism and a considerable delay in tuber sprouting patatin is one of the major soluble proteins in potato tubers and is encoded by a multigene family. based on structural considerations two classes of patatin genes are distinguished. the 5′‐upstream regulatory region of a class i gene contained within a 1.5 kb sequence is essential and sufficient to direct a high level of tuber‐specific gene activity which was on average 100‐ to 1000‐fold higher in tubers as compared to leaf, stem and roots in greenhouse grown transgenic potato plants when fused to the β‐glucuronidase reporter gene. histochemical analysis revealed this activity to be present in parenchymatic tissue but not in the peripheral phellem cells of transgenic tubers. furthermore the promoter fragment can be activated in leaves under conditions that simulate the need for the accumulation of starch in storage organs, i.e. high levels of sucrose. the expression is restricted to both mesophyll and epidermal cells in contrast to vascular tissue or hair cells.
@background surfactant phospholipid dppc downregulates monocyte respiratory burst via modulation of pkc. thrombolysis is widely used to intervene in acute ischemic stroke, but reestablishment of circulation may paradoxically initiate a reperfusion injury. here we describe studies with mice lacking protein kinase cdelta (pkcdelta) showing that absence of this enzyme markedly reduces reperfusion injury following transient ischemia. this was associated with reduced infiltration of peripheral blood neutrophils into infarcted tissue and with impaired neutrophil adhesion, migration, respiratory burst, and degranulation in vitro. total body irradiation followed by transplantation with bone marrow from pkcdelta-null mice donors reduced infarct size and improved neurological outcome in wt mice, whereas marrow transplantation from wt donors increased infarction and worsened neurological scores in pkcdelta-null mice. these results indicate an important role for neutrophil pkcdelta in reperfusion injury and strongly suggest that pkcdelta inhibitors could prove useful in the treatment of stroke.
@method molecular coevolution of the vertebrate cytochrome c the sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. these modifications are incorporated into a new program, clustal w which is freely available.
@method synergistic fermentation of camphor leaves by cellulolytic fungus and optimization of reducing sugar production a cellulase production process was developed by growing the fungi trichoderma reesei and aspergillus phoenicis on dairy manure. t. reesei produced a high total cellulase titer (1.7 filter paper units [fpu]/ml, filter paper activity) in medium containing 10 g/l of manure (dry basis [w/w]), 2 g/l kh2po4, 2 ml/l of tween-80, and 2mg/l of cocl2. however, β-glucosidase activity in the t. reesei-enzyme system was very low. t. reesei was then cocultured with a. phoenicis to enhance the β-glucosidase level. the mixed culture resulted in a relatively high level of total cellulase (1.54 fpu/ml) and β-glucosidase (0.64 iu/ml). the ratio of β-glucosidase activity to filter paper activity was 0.41, suitable for hydrolyzing manure cellulose. the crude enzyme broth from the mixed culture was used for hydrolyzing the manure cellulose, and the produced glucose was significantly (p<0.01) higher than levels obtained by using the commercial enzyme or the enzyme broth of the pure culture t. reesei.
@result existence of species complex largely reduced barcoding success for invasive species of tephritidae: a case study in bactrocera spp. backgroundvarious methods have been proposed to assign unknown specimens to known species using their dna barcodes, while others have focused on using genetic divergence thresholds to estimate “species” diversity for a taxon, without a well-developed taxonomy and/or an extensive reference library of dna barcodes. the major goals of the present work were to: a) conduct the largest species-level barcoding study of the muscidae to date and characterize the range of genetic divergence values in the northern nearctic fauna; b) evaluate the correspondence between morphospecies and barcode groupings defined using both clustering-based and threshold-based approaches; and c) use the reference library produced to address taxonomic issues.resultsour data set included 1114 individuals and their coi sequences (951 from churchill, manitoba), representing 160 morphologically-determined species from 25 genera, covering 89% of the known fauna of churchill and 23% of the nearctic fauna. following an iterative process through which all specimens belonging to taxa with anomalous divergence values and/or monophyly issues were re-examined, identity was modified for 9 taxa, including the reinstatement of phaonia luteva (walker) stat. nov. as a species distinct from phaonia errans (meigen). in the post-reassessment data set, no distinct gap was found between maximum pairwise intraspecific distances (range 0.00-3.01%) and minimum interspecific distances (range: 0.77-11.33%). nevertheless, using a clustering-based approach, all individuals within 98% of species grouped with their conspecifics with high (>95%) bootstrap support; in contrast, a maximum species discrimination rate of 90% was obtained at the optimal threshold of 1.2%. dna barcoding enabled the determination of females from 5 ambiguous species pairs and confirmed that 16 morphospecies were genetically distinct from named taxa. there were morphological differences among all distinct genetic clusters; thus, no cases of cryptic species were detected.conclusionsour findings reveal the great utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference barcode database against which to compare unknowns. when such a library is unavailable, it is still possible to obtain a fairly accurate (within ~10%) rapid assessment of species richness based upon a barcode divergence threshold alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon.
@background behavioral stability as an emergent process: toward a coherence theory of concentrated personal disadvantage this study used data from 6 sites and 3 countries to examine the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood and to analyze its linkage to violent and nonviolent offending outcomes in adolescence. the results indicate that among boys there is continuity in problem behavior from childhood to adolescence and that such continuity is especially acute when early problem behavior takes the form of physical aggression. chronic physical aggression during the elementary school years specifically increases the risk for continued physical violence as well as other nonviolent forms of delinquency during adolescence. however, this conclusion is reserved primarily for boys, because the results indicate no clear linkage between childhood physical aggression and adolescent offending among female samples despite notable similarities across male and female samples in the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood.
@background the role of udp-glucose:hydroxycinnamate glucosyltransferases in phenylpropanoid metabolism and the response to uv-b radiation in arabidopsis thaliana the three major flavonoids isolated from arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in the greenhouse were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis (uv, nmr, ms) and chiral capillary zone electrophoresis as the novel kaempferol 3-o-beta-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)d-glucopyranoside]-7-o-alpha-l- rhamnopyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (2), and kaempferol 3-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (3). comprehensive nmr studies including selective 1d and gradient-enhanced 2d techniques were applied in order to achieve full signal assignment and definitive proof of linkage for compound 1.
@background the role of interleukin-1β in human trophoblast motility interleukin-1 receptor type i, il-1 beta, il-1 receptor antagonist, and human macrophages were immunohistochemically localized in the villous trophoblast, maternal-trophoblast interphase, and maternal decidua during early human implantation. immunostaining for il-1 receptor type i was present in the syncytiotrophoblast and hyperplastic endometrial glands in the maternal decidua. immunoreactive il-1 beta was present in the villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, intermediate trophoblast, and maternal stromal decidual cells. il-1 receptor antagonist staining was observed in the glandular endometrium of the maternal decidua and in isolated cells located inside the chorionic villi, intervillous space, and maternal decidua. mature human macrophages, as defined by both cd/68+ and ham56+, were present in the chorionic villi, maternal blood of intervillous space, and maternal decidua. co-localization studies demonstrated that macrophages in all of the reported locations also stained for immunoreactive il-1 beta. our results show the shared presence in maternal and embryonic tissues of this receptor-agonist-antagonist system during early human implantation. this finding supports an autocrine/paracrine role for the il-1 system in human implantation.
@method strength training improves upper-limb function in individuals with stroke: a meta-analysis purpose: this paper reviews the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate force in individuals with stroke and summarizes the effects of strength training in these individuals. in addition, a systematic review of studies that have incorporated progressive strengthening interventions in individuals with stroke is presented. summary of key points: central (e.g., motor recruitment) and peripheral (e.g., muscle atrophy) sources may alter muscle strength in individuals with stroke and further investigations are needed to partition and quantify their effects. as to the effect of strength training interventions in individuals with stroke, the majority of studies (albeit with small samples) that evaluated muscle strength as an outcome demonstrated improvements. with regard to the effect of strength training on functional outcomes in individuals with stroke, positive outcomes were found in less rigorous pre-test/post-test studies, but more conflicting results with controlled trials. conclusions: although there is some suggestion that strength training alone can improve muscle strength, further research is required to optimize strength training and the transfer of these strength gains to functional tasks in individuals with stroke.
@background rosai-dorfman disease of the colon. sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy is a lymphoreticular disorder of obscure pathogenesis with extranodal lesions and a variable clinical course. clinical manifestations are most often in the head and neck, with 97% of patients showing cervical lymphadenopathy and a significant but lesser number having lesional infiltrates in the upper aerodigestive tracts, particularly the nasal cavity and salivary glands.
@background phosphatidylinositol‐phosphates mediate cytoskeletal reorganization during phagocytosis via a unique modular protein consisting of rhogef/dh and fyve domains in the parasitic protozoon entamoeba histolytica endocytosis is an important virulence function for entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery. although a number of e. histolytica proteins that regulate this process have been identified, less is known about the role of lipids. in other systems, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (pi3p), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase), has been shown to be required for endocytosis. fyve-finger domains are protein motifs that bind specifically to pi3p. using a pi3p biosensor consisting of glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fused to two tandem fyve-finger domains, we have localized pi3p to phagosomes but not fluid-phase pinosomes in e. histolytica, suggesting a role for pi3p in phagocytosis. treatment of cells with pi 3-kinase inhibitors impaired gst-2 x fyve-phagosome association supporting the authenticity of the biosensor staining. however, treatment with pi 3-kinase inhibitors did not inhibit e. histolytica-particle interaction, indicating that pi3p is not required for the initial step, but is required for subsequent steps of phagocytosis.
@method the influence of parent-child conflict and stressful experiences on the health of youth with asthma two hypotheses were tested: (a) one mechanism contributing to the high rate of disorder in children of women with affective disorders is elevated exposure to stressful events and conditions and (b) the children of depressed women, particularly women with unipolar depression, contribute to event occurrence because of increased interpersonal conflict. life stress interview assessments were made at 6-month intervals for 3 years on 53 children of unipolar, bipolar, medically ill, and normal women. both hypotheses were confirmed. transactional models of risk and further studies of the interpersonal functioning of children at risk for depression are needed.
@method bone mesenchymal stem cells attenuate radicular pain by inhibiting microglial activation in a rat noncompressive disk herniation model study design. autologous nucleus pulposus obtained from coccygeal intervertebral discs was grafted on the proximal of l5 dorsal root ganglion. pain behavior, mrna expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), and immunohistochemical changes were assessed. objective. the purpose of this study is to investigate temporal changes of il-8 expression in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and the pain-related behaviors with time course and to elucidate whether repertaxin (il-8 receptor inhibitor) attenuates pain-related behaviors in a rat model of lumbar disc herniation. summary of background data. inflammatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in radicular pain because of disc herniation. il-8, known as cxcl8, is a chemokine, which has been reported to be associated with painful degenerative disc disorders and chronic inflammatory pain states. methods. lumbar disc herniated rat model was made by implantation of the autologous nucleus pulposus, harvested from the coccygeal vertebra of each tail, on the left l5 nerve root just proximal to thedorsal root ganglion. rats were tested for mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 2 days before surgery, and on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 postoperatively. experimental group was intrathecally injected with the il-8 receptor inhibitor at l5 level on postoperative day 10. mechanical allodynia of the plantar surface of both hindpaw was tested on 30 minutes, 1, 3 hours, 1, 3, 5, and 10 days after administration. for the staining of astrocytes and microglia, immunohistochemical study was done 20 days after surgery. results. mechanical allodynia in ipsilateral hindpaw developed 1 day after surgery and lasted until 60 days and thermal withdrawal latency decreased significantly on the ipsilateral side 10 days after surgery and gradually increased through day 60. the il-8 receptor inhibitor attenuated the mechanical allodynia caused by nucleus pulposus when it was administered on postoperative day 10 and reduced microglial activation and phosphorylated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (perk) expression in the spinal dorsal horn. conclusion. il-8 might be a potential therapeutic target in chronic radicular neuropathic pain because of disc herniation, cxcl8 inhibitor could be one of its promising therapeutic agents.
@method associations of urinary phthalate metabolites with residential characteristics, lifestyles, and dietary habits among young children in shanghai, china. phthalate esters (pes), bisphenol a (bpa), and parabens (pbs), which are used in numerous consumer products, are known for their endocrine disrupting properties. organophosphate chemicals (ops), which form the basis of the majority of pesticides, are known for their neurotoxic activity in humans. all of these chemicals are associated with health problems to which children are more susceptible. once they enter the human body, pes, bpa, pbs, and ops are metabolized and/or conjugated and finally excreted via urine. hence, human exposure to these substances is examined through a determination of the urinary concentrations of their metabolites. this study assessed the exposure of greek preschool-age children to pes, bpa, pbs, and ops by investigating the urinary levels of seven pes metabolites, six pbs, bpa, and six dialkyl phosphate metabolites in five-hundred samples collected from 4-year-old children, subjects of the "rhea" mother-child cohort in crete, greece. daily intake of endocrine disruptors, calculated for 4 year old children, was lower than the corresponding daily intake for 2.5 year old children, which were determined in an earlier study of the same cohort. in some cases the daily intake levels exceeded the u.s. environmental protection agency tolerable daily intake (tdi) values and the efsa reference doses (rfd) (e.g., for di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate, 3.6% and 1% of the children exceeded rfd and tdi, respectively). exposure was linked to three main sources: pes-bpa to plastic, pbs-diethyl phthalate to personal hygiene products, and ops to food.
@background the use and role of predictive systems in disease management. twenty five years after its first enunciation, ipm is recognized as one of the most robust constructs to arise in the agricultural sciences during the second half of the twentieth century. the history of ipm, however, can be traced back to the late 1800s when ecology was identified as the foundation for scientific plant protection. that history, since the advent of modern organosynthetic pesticides, acquired elements of drama, intrigue, jealousy, and controversy that mark the path of many great scientific or technological achievements. evolution of ipm followed multiple paths in several countries and reached beyond the confines of entomological sciences. time and space constraints, however, bias this review toward entomology, among the plant protection sciences, and give it an obvious us slant, despite the global impact of ipm.
@method cell-cell interactions during remodeling of the intestine at metamorphosis in xenopus laevis. thyroid hormone controls remodeling of the tadpole intestine during the climax of amphibian metamorphosis. in 8 days, the xenopus laevis tadpole intestine shortens in length by 75%. simultaneously, the longitudinal muscle fibers contract by about the same extent. the radial muscle fibers also shorten as the diameter narrows. many radial fibers undergo programmed cell death. we conclude that muscle remodeling and contraction play key roles in the shortening process. shortening is accompanied by a temporary "heaping" of the epithelial cells into many layers at climax. cells that face the lumen undergo apoptosis. by the end of metamorphosis, when the epithelium is folded into crypts and villi, the epithelium is a single-cell layer once again. throughout this remodeling, dna replication occurs uniformly throughout the epithelium, as do changes in gene expression. the larval epithelial cells as a whole, rather than a subpopulation of stem cells, are the progenitors of the adult epithelial cells.
@background human leukocyte antigen class i alleles and haplotypes associated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma in persistent hbv-infected patients. the high prevalence of nasopharyngeal cancer (npc) in southern asia and mediterranean northern africa suggests genetic predisposition among other factors. while human leukocyte antigen (hla) haplotypes have been conclusively associated with npc predisposition in asians, northern african maghrebians have been less intensely studied. however, low resolution serological methods identified weak positive associations with hla-b5, b13 and b18 and a negative with hla-b14. using sequence based typing (sbt), we performed a direct comparison of hla class i frequencies in a cohort of 136 tunisian patients with npc matched for gender, age and geographical residence to 148 normal tunisians. the bimodal age distribution of npc in maghrebians was also taken into account. hla frequencies in normal tunisians were also compared with those of northern moroccan berbers (me) to evaluate whether the tunisian population in this study could be considered representative of other maghrebian populations. hla-b14 and -cw08 were negatively associated with npc (odd ratio = 0.09 and 0.18 respectively, fisher p2-value = 0.0001 and = 0.003). moreover, positive associations were observed for hla-b-18, -b51 (split of -b5) and -b57 (p2-value < 0.025 in all) confirming previous findings in maghrebs. the hla-b14/cw*08 haplotype frequency (hf) was 0.007 in npc patients compared to 0.057 in both tunisian (or = 0.12; p2-value = 0.001) and moroccan controls. this study confirms several previous associations noted by serologic typing between hla class i alleles and the prevalence of npc in maghrebians populations. in addition, we identified a putative haplotype rare in tunisian patients with npc that may serve as a genetic marker for further susceptibility studies.
@result ancient waste pits with wood ash irreversibly increase crop production in central europe tree species and wood ash application in plantations of short-rotation woody crops (srwc) may have important effects on the soil productive capacity through their influence on soil organic matter (som) and exchangeable cations. an experiment was conducted to assess changes in soil c and n contents and ph within the 0–50 cm depth, and exchangeable cation (ca2+, mg2+, k+, and na+) and extractable acidity concentrations within the 0–10 cm depth. the effects of different species (european larch [larix decidua p. mill.], aspen [populus tremula l. × populus tremuloides michx.], and four poplar [populus spp.] clones) and wood ash applications (0, 9, and 18 mg ha−1) on soil properties were evaluated, using a common garden experiment (n = 70 stands) over 7 years of management in michigan’s upper peninsula. soils were of the onaway series (fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid inceptic hapludalfs). the nm-6 poplar clone had the greatest soil c and n contents in almost all ash treatment levels. soil c contents were 7.5, 19.4, and 10.7 mg c ha−1 greater under the nm-6 poplar than under larch in the ash-free, medium-, and high-level plots, respectively. within the surface layer, ash application increased soil c and n contents (p < 0.05) through the addition of about 0.7 mg c ha−1 and 3 kg n ha−1 with the 9 mg ha−1 ash application (twofold greater c and n amounts were added with the 18 mg ha−1 application). during a decadal time scale, tree species had no effects—except for k+—on the concentrations of the exchangeable cations, ph, and extractable acidity. in contrast, ash application increased soil ph and the concentration of ca2+ (p < 0.05), from 5.2 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 8.6 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (high-level ash plots), and tended to increase the concentration of mg2+ (p < 0.1), while extractable acidity was reduced (p < 0.05) from 5.6 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 3.7 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (high-level plots). wood ash application, within certain limits, not only had a beneficial effect on soil properties important to the long-term productivity of fast-growing plantations but also enhanced long-term soil c sequestration.
@result a mouse model of non-motor symptoms in parkinson's disease: focus on pharmacological interventions targeting affective dysfunctions parkinson's disease (pd) is frequently accompanied by symptoms of depression and anxiety. however, the relationship between anxiety and depression has not been rigorously defined in these patients. in this study, 42 patients with pd and 21 matched medical controls were evaluated using dsm-iii-r criteria and a variety of psychiatric rating scales. twelve (29%) pd patients but only one medical control had a formal anxiety disorder diagnosis. of the 12 patients with pd who had an anxiety disorder diagnosis, 11 (92%) had a comorbid depressive disorder diagnosis. of the 18 patients with a depressive disorder, 12 (67%) also had an anxiety disorder diagnosis. furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis found that the depression measure explained 44% of the variance in anxiety measures whereas neither the severity of illness variables nor the levodopa dose contributed significantly to the variance. this study suggests that the excess anxiety found in pd patients is unlikely to be primarily a psychologic reaction to the illness or a side effect of levodopa treatment. rather, we suggest that anxiety and depression are related manifestations of the underlying neurochemical changes of pd itself.
@background the folding of a family of three-helix bundle proteins: spectrin r15 has a robust folding nucleus, unlike its homologous neighbours☆ energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. the primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein’s native structure. theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. for some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the r15, r16 and r17 domains of α-spectrin. r15 folds ∼3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of r16 and r17. we use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a ‘normal’ protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond–second, timescale.
@method difference in human cardiovascular response between upright and supine recovery from upright cycle exercise transitional changes in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output resulting from head-up tilt were measured in healthy male subjects, using impedance cardiography. respiratory frequency, tidal volume, ventilation rate, end-tidal o2 and co2 tensions, o2 uptake, co2 output, and exchange ratio were also determined breath-by-breath. when the subject was tilted upward from a supine to an upright position, the stroke volume was decreased while the heart rate was increased. the time required to attain the steady state was shorter in the stroke volume change than in the heart rate. in addition, since the heart rate was not increased so high as to be inversely related to the stroke volume, the cardiac output decreased by tilting upward. the ventilation rate remained almost unchanged within a tilt angle of 60 degrees or so. thus, both the o2 and co2 fractions in expired air showed transitory changes. as the original body position was restored, the cardiac output was increased to the initial level, the tidal volume showing a transient increase. during the recovery process, pco2, in expired air increased and po2 decreased, showing that the change in cardiac output exceeded that in ventilation in quantity. the change in ventilation moreover, preceded that of expired pco2 by ca. 10 sec, suggesting that the enhancement of ventilation occurred through some agent(s) other than the chemical drive.
@method further validation of the pillbox test in a mixed clinical sample studies indicate that executive functioning (ef) is a strong predictor of everyday function. however, assessment can be problematic as no single standardized instrument is known to measure all ef domains simultaneously. thus, the pillbox test was developed as a new measure tapping four ef factors through the real-time assessment of medication management, a complex instrumental activity of daily living. the pillbox test showed good criterion-related validity and was effective in differentiating graduated levels of executive dysfunction between a mixed neurological group, medical control group, and healthy community control group. this test also showed good convergent validity as it correlated significantly in expected directions with established ef measures in all four of selected ef domains and the direct assessment of functional status. finally, a receiver operator characteristic curve found a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 87.5%, suggesting that the pillbox test is a promising new ecological measure of ef.
@background stoichiometry of animal manure and implications for nutrient cycling and agriculture in sub-saharan africa the effect of integrated farmyard manure (fym) and inorganic nitrogen (n) and phosphorous (p) fertilizers on growth, yield, and terminal moisture stress tolerance of rain-fed lowland rice was assessed in a field experiment carried out at fogera plains, in north-western ethiopia during the main cropping seasons of 2010 and 2011. treatments were factorial combinations of three rates of fym (0, 7.5, and 15 t ha), three rates of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 kg n ha) and three rates of phosphorus (0, 50, and 100 kg p2o5 ha). the experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design replicated three times per treatment. data were collected on rice yield and yield components. leaf area index (lai), crop growth rate (cgr), net assimilation rate (nar) and harvest index (hi) were computed. economic analysis was also performed by estimating costs of alternative uses of fym and inorganic fertilizers as well as grain and straw prices. analysis of the results revealed that applying fym at 15 t ha combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha increased grain yield by 123% and 38% compared to the negative (00-0 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) and positive (0-120-100 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) controls, respectively. similarly; lai, cgr, nar, the number of filled spikelets per panicle, n and p uptake,biomass yield, and grain protein content as well as agrophysiological efficiency of n and p were significantly enhanced in response to increasing the rates of fym and inorganic n and p fertilizers. it was observed that 15 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha resulted in the maximum grain yield, grain protein content, and terminal moisture stress escape. though grain yield continued increasing significantly upto the highest combinations, results of the economic analysis showed that the maximum net benefit was obtained in response to the application of 7.5 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha.
@background timing of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia predicts prognosis in metastatic colon cancer patients: a retrospective study in mfolfox6 -treated patients background chemotherapy induced neutropenia has been shown to be associated with improved treatment outcomes in selected solid tumours. we studied the association of chemotherapy induced neutropenia with treatment related outcomes in small cell lung cancer (sclc).   methods this is a retrospective analysis of patients receiving chemotherapy for sclc at the royal marsden hospital, uk over an 8 year period. the chemotherapy included carboplatin auc 5, iv and etoposide 100mg/m(2) iv on day 1 and 100mg/m(2) po, b.i.d. on day 2 and 3 every 21 days. patients were stratified into two groups (a) those experiencing grades 0-2 neutropenia and group (b) those experiencing grades 3-4 neutropenia. the outcomes studied were response rate, time to progression (ttp) and overall survival (os).   results 173 patients were studied. the median age 64 (range 39-83) and m/f ratio was 112:61. the response rates in groups a and b was 90% versus 90%, p=1.0. the median ttp in groups a and b was 30 and 38 weeks, p=0.05. the median os in groups a and b was 47 weeks versus 60 weeks, p=0.008. the differences in ttp and os were not significant in patients with extensive stage disease.   conclusions occurrence of chemotherapy induced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia correlated with os in patients with sclc receiving carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. trials exploring controlled, safe intra-patient dose escalation with the intent of achieving grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patients with sclc are warranted.
@background solvent effect on hemin-catalyzed polymerization of phenols horseradish peroxidase (hrp) is a commercially important enzyme that is available from a number of supply houses in a variety of grades of purity and isoenzymic combinations. the present article describes a comparative study made on nine hrp preparations. six of these samples were predominantly composed of basic hrp, pl 8.5, and three of acidic hrp, pl 3.5. two of the basic preparations were of lower purity than the others. the apparent molar catalytic activity of basic hrp with 0.5 mmabts and 0.2 mm h2o2 was around 950 s−1 (about 770 s−1 for the less pure samples) and with a 5 mm guaiacol and 0.6 mm h2o2 was about 180 s−1 for all the samples. a similar value (approximately 1000 s−1) was observed for acidic hrp but only at higher concentrations of abts (20 mm). with 20 mm guaiacol the molar catalytic activity of the acid isoenzyme was 65 s−1. the apparent km for abts of the acidic isoenzyme was 4 mm whereas for the basic isoenzyme it was 0.1 mm. all the enzymes were inactivated by h2o2 when it was supplied as the only substrate. under these conditions the partition ratio (r = number of catalytic cycles given by the enzyme before its inactivation), apparent dissociation constant (kl), and apparent rate constant of inactivation (kinact) were about twice as large for the acidic samples (1350, 2.6 mm, 9 · 10−3 s−1) as for the basic (650, 1.3 mm, 5 · 10−3 s−1). the apparent catalytic constant (kcat) was 3–4 times larger, and the efficiency of catalysis (kcat/kl) was double for the acidic isoenzyme, but the efficiency of inactivation (kinact/kl) was similar. the data obtained provide useful information for those using hrp isoenzymes for biotechnological applications (e.g., biosensors, bioreactors, or assays). © 1996 john wiley & sons, inc.
@method in vivo analysis of cell division, cell growth, and differentiation at the shoot apical meristem in arabidopsis article, publication date, and citation information can be found at www.plantcell.org/cgi/doi/10.1105/tpc.017962. controlled gene expression in time and space is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function during plant development. here, we report ethanol inducible gene expression in defined sub-domains of the shoot apical and floral meristems. for this, expression of an ethanol-regulated transcription factor, alcr, is restricted to precise domains using specific promoters. gene expression activation is followed using reporters under the control of the alca promoter, which responds to alcr only in the presence of the ethanol. we demonstrate that precise control of spatially limited gene expression can be achieved. the kinetics of reporter gene activation and inactivation following a pulse of ethanol induction shows that the system is dynamic and suitable for precise temporal control of expression. the system is both flexible and robust, permitting simultaneous expression of two genes in a given domain or, conversely, the expression of a gene in two separate domains. we also show that this strategy can be applied to mis-express genes with developmental roles, by manipulating expression of the shoot meristemless (stm) and cyclin d3;1 (cycd3;1) genes during plant development.
@background histological finding of atypical subtrochanteric fracture after long-term alendronate therapy reports linking long‐term use of bisphosphonates (bps) with atypical fractures of the femur led the leadership of the american society for bone and mineral research (asbmr) to appoint a task force to address key questions related to this problem. a multidisciplinary expert group reviewed pertinent published reports concerning atypical femur fractures, as well as preclinical studies that could provide insight into their pathogenesis. a case definition was developed so that subsequent studies report on the same condition. the task force defined major and minor features of complete and incomplete atypical femoral fractures and recommends that all major features, including their location in the subtrochanteric region and femoral shaft, transverse or short oblique orientation, minimal or no associated trauma, a medial spike when the fracture is complete, and absence of comminution, be present to designate a femoral fracture as atypical. minor features include their association with cortical thickening, a periosteal reaction of the lateral cortex, prodromal pain, bilaterality, delayed healing, comorbid conditions, and concomitant drug exposures, including bps, other antiresorptive agents, glucocorticoids, and proton pump inhibitors. preclinical data evaluating the effects of bps on collagen cross‐linking and maturation, accumulation of microdamage and advanced glycation end products, mineralization, remodeling, vascularity, and angiogenesis lend biologic plausibility to a potential association with long‐term bp use. based on published and unpublished data and the widespread use of bps, the incidence of atypical femoral fractures associated with bp therapy for osteoporosis appears to be very low, particularly compared with the number of vertebral, hip, and other fractures that are prevented by bps. moreover, a causal association between bps and atypical fractures has not been established. however, recent observations suggest that the risk rises with increasing duration of exposure, and there is concern that lack of awareness and underreporting may mask the true incidence of the problem. given the relative rarity of atypical femoral fractures, the task force recommends that specific diagnostic and procedural codes be created and that an international registry be established to facilitate studies of the clinical and genetic risk factors and optimal surgical and medical management of these fractures. physicians and patients should be made aware of the possibility of atypical femoral fractures and of the potential for bilaterality through a change in labeling of bps. research directions should include development of animal models, increased surveillance, and additional epidemiologic and clinical data to establish the true incidence of and risk factors for this condition and to inform orthopedic and medical management. © 2010 american society for bone and mineral research.
@method variability of erythrocyte and serum lithium levels correlates with therapist treatment adherence efforts and maintenance treatment outcome background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.
@background nbce1 (slc4a4) a potential ph regulator in enamel organ cells during enamel development in the mouse mature enamel consists of densely packed and highly organized large hydroxyapatite crystals. the molecular machinery responsible for the formation of fully matured enamel is poorly described but appears to involve oscillative ph changes at the enamel surface. we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of selected transporters and related proteins in the multilayered rat incisor enamel organ. connexin 43 (cx-43) is found in papillary cells and ameloblasts, whereas na(+)-k(+)-atpase is heavily expressed during maturation in the papillary cell layer only. given the distribution of cx-43 channels and na(+)-k(+)-atpase, we suggest that ameloblasts and the papillary cell layer act as a functional syncytium. during enamel maturation ameloblasts undergo repetitive cycles of modulation between ruffle-ended (ra) and smooth-ended (sa) ameloblast morphologies. carbonic anhydrase ii and vacuolar h(+)-atpase are expressed simultaneously at the beginning of the maturation stage in ra cells. the proton pumps are present in the ruffled border of ra and appear to be internalized during the sa stage. both papillary cells and ameloblasts express plasma membrane acid/base transporters (ae2, nbc, and nhe1). ae2 and nhe1 change position relative to the enamel surface as localization of the tight junctions changes during ameloblast modulation cycles. we suggest that the concerted action of the papillary cell layer and the modulating ameloblasts regulates the enamel microenvironment, resulting in oscillating ph fluctuations. the ph fluctuations at the enamel surface may be required to keep intercrystalline spaces open in the surface layers of the enamel, enabling degraded enamel matrix proteins to be removed while hydroxyapatite crystals grow as a result of influx of calcium and phosphate ions.
@background restoration of hypothalamic signaling systems as a cause of improved metabolic parameters in rats with neonatal diabetes model during treatment with bromocriptine mesylate bromocriptine, a dopamine d2 agonist, inhibits seasonal fattening and improves seasonal insulin resistance in syrian hamsters. alterations in daily rhythms of neuroendocrine activities are involved in the regulation of seasonal metabolic changes. changes in circadian neuroendocrine activities that regulate metabolism are believed to be modulated by central circadian oscillators within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) of seasonal animals. we examined the association of metabolic responses to bromocriptine with its effects on the daily rhythms of metabolic hormones and daily monoamine profiles within the scn, a primary circadian pacemaker known to regulate metabolism, in syrian hamsters. obese glucose-intolerant male syrian hamsters (body weight [bw] 185 ± 10 g) held on 14h daily photoperiods were treated at light onset with bromocriptine (800 μg/animal/day, ip) or vehicle for 2 weeks. animals were then subjected to a glucose tolerance test (gtt) (3 g/kg bw, ip). different subsets of animals (n = 6) from each treatment group were sacrificed at 0h/24h, 5h, 10h, 15h, or 20h after light onset for analyses of scn monoamines, plasma insulin, prolactin, cortisol, thyroxin (t4), triiodothyronine (t3), glucose, and free fatty acids (ffas). compared with control values, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced weight gain (14.9 vs. −2.9 g, p <. 01) and the areas under the gtt glucose and insulin curves by 29% and 48%, respectively (p <. 05). basal plasma insulin concentration was markedly reduced throughout the day in bromocriptine-treated animals without influencing plasma glucose levels. bromocriptine reduced the daily peak in ffa by 26% during the late light span(p <. 05). bromocriptine significantly shifted the daily plasma cortisol peak from the early dark to the light period of the day, reduced the plasma prolactin (mean 1.8 vs. 39.4 ng/dl) and t4 throughout the day (mean 1.6 vs. 3.8 μg/dl), and selectively reduced t3 during the dark period of the day (p <. 01). concurrently, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced scn dopamine turnover during the light period and shifted daily peaks of scn serotonin and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) content by 12h from the light to the dark period of the day (p <. 05). this was confirmed by a further in vivo microdialysis study in which bromocriptine increased scn extracellular 5-hiaa of glucose-intolerant hamsters during the dark phase (47% increase, p <. 05) toward levels observed in normal glucose-tolerant hamsters. thus, bromocriptine-induced resetting of daily patterns of scn neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the effects of bromocriptine on attenuation of the obese insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant condition. a large body of corroborating evidence suggests that such bromocriptine-induced changes in scn monoamine metabolism may be functional in its effects on metabolism.

@background sinomenine hydrochloride inhibits the metastasis of human glioblastoma cells by suppressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 and reversing the endogenous and exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition processing bodies (p-bodies) are ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in post-transcriptional mrna metabolism that accumulate in cells exposed to various stress stimuli. the treatment of mammary epithelial cells with transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β), triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt), and induces the formation of p-bodies. ectopic expression of the transcription factor twist, which stimulates emt downstream of the tgf-β receptor, also promotes p-body formation. removal of tgf-β from treated cells results in the clearance of p-bodies by a process that is blocked by inhibitors of autophagy. activators of autophagy enhance p-body clearance and block emt. blockage of p-body formation by disruption of the gene for ddx6, a protein essential for p-body assembly, blocks emt and prevents tumor cell metastasis in vivo. these studies suggest critical roles for p-body formation and autophagy in transitions of cancer cells between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and help explain how autophagy functions to promote or suppress tumor cell growth during different stages of tumorigenesis.
@result effect of the cauliflower or transgene on carotenoid accumulation and chromoplast formation in transgenic potato tubers. in order to enhance the carotenoid content of potato tubers, transgenic potato plants have been produced expressing an erwinia uredovora crtb gene encoding phytoene synthase, specifically in the tuber of solanum tuberosum l. cultivar desiree which normally produces tubers containing c. 5.6 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and also in solanum phureja l. cv. mayan gold which has a tuber carotenoid content of typically 20 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw. in developing tubers of transgenic crtb desiree lines, carotenoid levels reached 35 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and the balance of carotenoids changed radically compared with controls: beta-carotene levels in the transgenic tubers reached c. 11 microg g(-1) dw, whereas control tubers contained negligible amounts and lutein accumulated to a level 19-fold higher than empty-vector transformed controls. the crtb gene was also transformed into s. phureja (cv. mayan gold), again resulting in an increase in total carotenoid content to 78 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw in the most affected transgenic line. in these tubers, the major carotenoids were violaxanthin, lutein, antheraxanthin, and beta-carotene. no increases in expression levels of the major carotenoid biosynthetic genes could be detected in the transgenic tubers, despite the large increase in carotenoid accumulation. microarray analysis was used to identify a number of genes that were consistently up- or down-regulated in transgenic crtb tubers compared with empty vector controls. the implications of these data from a nutritional standpoint and for further modifications of tuber carotenoid content are discussed.
@result increasing trend of reflux esophagitis and decreasing trend of helicobacter pylori infection in patients from a multiethnic asian country the aim of this study was to determine, first, whether racial differences exist in the seroprevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in singapore, and second, whether these differences correlate with racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency. a commercial serological test for immunoglobulin (ig)g antibody to h. pylori which was 90% sensitive and 83% specific in our population was used to screen 403 adult blood donors of chinese, malay and indian origin, aged between 15–60 years. serum specimens from 84 paediatric patients admitted to the paediatrics department, national university of singapore, with non‐gastroenterological illnesses were also tested. in all three races, seroprevalence of h. pylori increased with age. indians have the highest prevalence of infection followed by chinese and malays. peptic ulcer prevalences are known to be highest in chinese, followed by indians and malays. the malays have the lowest prevalence of h. pylori and peptic ulcer among the three races in singapore. indians have a higher prevalence of h. pylori antibodies but a lower frequency of peptic ulcer than the chinese. racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency between chinese and indians are not explained by the prevalence of h. pylori infection; other environmental or genetic factors may be involved.
@background μ-opioid receptors: correlation of agonist efficacy for signalling with ability to activate internalization we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
@background feasibility and diagnostic performance of dual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in ct1-2n0m0 gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic studies purpose complicated gastric lymphatic drainage potentially undermines the utility of sentinel node (sn) biopsy in patients with gastric cancer. encouraged by several favorable single-institution reports, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase ii study of sn mapping that used a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique.   patients and methods patients with previously untreated ct1 or ct2 gastric adenocarcinomas < 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. sn mapping was performed by using a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. following biopsy of the identified sns, mandatory comprehensive d2 or modified d2 gastrectomy was performed according to current japanese gastric cancer association guidelines.   results among 433 patients who gave preoperative consent, 397 were deemed eligible on the basis of surgical findings. sn biopsy was performed in all patients, and the sn detection rate was 97.5% (387 of 397). of 57 patients with lymph node metastasis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining, 93% (53 of 57) had positive sns, and the accuracy of nodal evaluation for metastasis was 99% (383 of 387). only four false-negative sn biopsies were observed, and pathologic analysis revealed that three of those biopsies were pt2 or tumors > 4 cm. we observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the sn mapping procedure.   conclusion the endoscopic dual tracer method for sn biopsy was confirmed as safe and effective when applied to the superficial, relatively small gastric adenocarcinomas included in this study.
@method coherent activity between brain regions that code for value is linked to the malleability of human behavior although persuasive messages often alter people's self-reported attitudes and intentions to perform behaviors, these self-reports do not necessarily predict behavior change. we demonstrate that neural responses to persuasive messages can predict variability in behavior change in the subsequent week. specifically, an a priori region of interest (roi) in medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) was reliably associated with behavior change (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). additionally, an iterative cross-validation approach using activity in this mpfc roi predicted an average 23% of the variance in behavior change beyond the variance predicted by self-reported attitudes and intentions. thus, neural signals can predict behavioral changes that are not predicted from self-reported attitudes and intentions alone. additionally, this is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging study to demonstrate that a neural signal can predict complex real world behavior days in advance.
@background the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
@method a brief and preliminary look at snps data for some bering-chukchi-beaufort seas bowhead whales this journal frequently contains papers that report values of f-statistics estimated from genetic data collected from several populations. these parameters, fst, fit, and fis, were introduced by wright (1951), and offer a convenient means of summarizing population structure. while there is some disagreement about the interpretation of the quantities, there is considerably more disagreement on the method of evaluating them. different authors make different assumptions about sample sizes or numbers of populations and handle the difficulties of multiple alleles and unequal sample sizes in different ways. wright himself, for example, did not consider the effects of finite sample size. the purpose of this discussion is to offer some unity to various estimation formulae and to point out that correlations of genes in structured populations, with which f-statistics are concerned, are expressed very conveniently with a set of parameters treated by cockerham (1 969, 1973). we start with the parameters and construct appropriate estimators for them, rather than beginning the discussion with various data functions. the extension of cockerham's work to multiple alleles and loci will be made explicit, and the use of jackknife procedures for estimating variances will be advocated. all of this may be regarded as an extension of a recent treatment of estimating the coancestry coefficient to serve as a mea-
@background aflatoxin b1 and m1 degradation by lac2 from pleurotus pulmonarius and redox mediators aflatoxins are cancerogenic compounds produced predominantly by certain strains of the aspergillus genus. the ideal solution for minimization of health risk that aflatoxins pose is the prevention of foods and feeds contamination. unfortunately, these contaminants can never be completely removed, and on that account, many studies have been carried out to explore an effective process of their detoxification to a threshold level. biological decontamination seems to be attractive because it works under mild, environmentally friendly conditions. this review is focused on the biological detoxification of aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin b1, by microorganisms. there are briefly mentioned aflatoxin metabolic pathways in the human and animal body. microorganisms such as soil or water bacteria, fungi, and protozoa and specific enzymes isolated from microbial systems can degrade aflatoxin group members with varied efficiency to less- or nontoxic products. some aflatoxin-producing fungi from aspergillus species have the capability to degrade their own synthesized mycotoxins. yeasts and lactic acid bacteria work as biological adsorbents that prevent aflatoxin’s transfer to the intestinal tract of humans and animals. aflatoxin b1 absorbed into the organism could be metabolized by significantly different pathways. they lead to the production of the relatively nontoxic compounds, on the one hand, or to highly toxic active forms on the other hand.
@method bimodal δ-opioid receptors regulate vagal bradycardia in canine sinoatrial node background: methionine-enkephalin-arginine-phenylalanine (meap) is an endogenous opiate derived from the c-terminal sequence of the larger precursor molecule proenkephalin. this heptapeptide is abundant in the myocardium and has significant vagolytic activity when infused systemically. meap interrupted vagal bradycardia when it was delivered directly into the sinoatrial node by local microdialysis. this study was conducted to determine the opioid receptor responsible for the vagolytic effect of meap. methods and results: microdialysis probes were placed in the sinoatrial node of mongrel dogs and perfused at 5 μl/min. increasing doses of meap were included in the nodal perfusate and approximately two thirds of the vagal bradycardia was inhibited with a maximal effect at 0.3 nmoles/μ,l and a half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,ul. when deltorphin ii (a delta opioid receptor agonist) was infused into the sinoatrial node, more than 95% of the vagal bradycardia was eliminated at 0.3 nmoles/,ul with the half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,l, indicating that deltorphin ii was more efficacious than meap. the maximal deltorphin ii and meap effects were both similarly reversed by the paired infusion of increasing doses of the 6 opiate receptor antagonist, naltrindole. selected, μ (endomorphin, super dalda) and κ (dynorphin, u50488) receptor agonists and,μ (ctap) and κ (norbni) receptor antagonists were completely ineffective in this system. conclusions: these data suggest that the vagolytic effect of meap involves the activation of delta opiate receptors within the sinoatrial node.
@background interactions between torulaspora delbrueckii and saccharomyces cerevisiae in wine fermentation: influence of inoculation and nitrogen content hanseniaspora guilliermondii and hanseniaspora uvarum were tested in grape must fermentations as pure and mixed starter cultures with saccharomyces cerevisiae. in pure cultures, the specific growth rates found were 0.29 h(-1) for h. uvarum, 0.23 h(-1) for h. guilliermondii and 0.18 h(-1) for s. cerevisiae. no significant differences were observed between these values and those obtained in mixed cultures. results presented in this work show that growth of apiculate yeasts during the first days of fermentation enhances the production of desirable compounds, such as esters, and may not have a negative influence on the production of higher alcohols and undesirable heavy sulphur compounds. growth of apiculate yeasts reduced the total content of higher alcohols in wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. furthermore, the highest levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate were obtained when h. guilliermondii was inoculated in grape musts, whereas h. uvarum increased the isoamyl acetate content of wines. apiculate yeasts produced high amounts of ethyl acetate; however, the level of this compound decreased in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae. when s. cerevisiae was used as a starter culture, wines showed higher concentrations of glycerol, 2-phenylethanol and ethyl hexanoate. in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae, wines presented amounts of methionol, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoethanol and cis-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol similar to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. an increase in the amounts of 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol, trans-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol was obtained in wines produced from mixed cultures with h. guilliermondii.

@method fuzzy memoization for floating-point multimedia applications power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. as a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. in addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. this paper presents wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. wattch is 1000x or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. this paper presents several validations of wattch's accuracy. in addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. we see wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. it also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar simplescalar framework.
@result an estimation of the protein requirements of iberian x duroc 50:50 crossbred growing pigs. the objective of the present experiment was to define the form of the relationship between varying levels of energy intake at constant, high protein intake and the performance of young pigs. by doing so it was expected that we could distinguish between four models that predict the pig's responses to its diet as rates of protein and lipid retention. forty young pigs were assigned at 12 kg live weight either to an initial slaughter group (n 8) or to one of four allowances of starch intake at a constant intake of a high-protein feed (with 345 g crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25)/kg food). half the pigs were killed after 4 weeks and half after 8 weeks on the treatments; at each slaughter point on each treatment half the pigs were entire males and half were females. increasing the intake of starch (energy) resulted in significant increases in the rates of live weight, empty-body, protein and lipid gains of pigs slaughtered at both stages. there was no minimum positive lipid:protein ratio in the gain of the pigs. male pigs deposited more protein and less lipid than females but this effect of sex on protein and lipid retention was seen only on the two highest allowances of starch intake. the calculated efficiency of protein utilization increased with increasing starch intake up to a maximum of 0.81, when probably the energy:protein in the diet became non-limiting. the results led to the rejection of two of the models that predict the rates of protein and lipid retention as responses to protein and energy intake, but the two remaining models could not be rejected, at least qualitatively.
@background quantitative fret imaging to visualize the invasiveness of live breast cancer cells matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of zinc-binding endopeptidases, play important roles in cancer proliferation and dissemination, and may be further associated with other diseases. in particular, membrane-type mmps (mt-mmps) are crucial for cancer cell invasion. in this report, we summarize the current views on the role of mt-mmps in cancer dissemination. the regulated and restricted degradation of the extracellular matrix (ecm) surrounding the tumor surface is a trigger event for cell protrusion and invasion. this is thought to be primarily organized by mt-mmps, since a shift in balance between cell adhesion molecules, ecm and proteolysis at the focal cell surface may result in conditions especially suitable for cancer cells to progress and invade the ecm. to resolve the physiological mechanisms of cancer invasion and migration, molecular milieu surrounding the mt-mmps expressed on tumor cell surfaces should be further examined for each cell type, which may consequently provide a novel clinical tool to regulate cancer behavior.
@background knat2: evidence for a link between knotted-like genes and carpel development. the first step in flower development is the generation of a floral meristem by the inflorescence meristem. we have analyzed how this process is affected by mutant alleles of the arabidopsis gene leafy. we show that leafy interacts with another floral control gene, apetala1, to promote the transition from inflorescence to floral meristem. we have cloned the leafy gene, and, consistent with the mutant phenotype, we find that leafy rna is expressed strongly in young flower primordia. leafy expression procedes expression of the homeotic genes agamous and apetala3, which specify organ identify within the flower. furthermore, we demonstrate that leafy is the arabidopsis homolog of the floricaula gene, which controls floral meristem identity in the distantly related species antirrhinum majus.
@result real-time imaging of huntingtin aggregates diverting target search and gene transcription stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of rna-binding proteins (rbps) and rna. functional impairment of stress granules has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy-diseases that are characterized by fibrillar inclusions of rbps. genetic evidence suggests a link between persistent stress granules and the accumulation of pathological inclusions. here, we demonstrate that the disease-related rbp hnrnpa1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (llps) into protein-rich droplets mediated by a low complexity sequence domain (lcd). while the lcd of hnrnpa1 is sufficient to mediate llps, the rna recognition motifs contribute to llps in the presence of rna, giving rise to several mechanisms for regulating assembly. importantly, while not required for llps, fibrillization is enhanced in protein-rich droplets. we suggest that lcd-mediated llps contributes to the assembly of stress granules and their liquid properties and provides a mechanistic link between persistent stress granules and fibrillar protein pathology in disease.
@background stn1 is critical for telomere maintenance and long-term viability of somatic human cells the proper maintenance of telomeres is essential for genome stability. mammalian telomere maintenance is governed by a number of telomere binding proteins, including the newly identified ctc1–stn1–ten1 (cst) complex. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian cst remain unclear. to address this question, we conditionally deleted ctc1 from mice. we report here that ctc1 null mice experience rapid onset of global cellular proliferative defects and die prematurely from complete bone marrow failure due to the activation of an atr‐dependent g2/m checkpoint. acute deletion of ctc1 does not result in telomere deprotection, suggesting that mammalian cst is not involved in capping telomeres. rather, ctc1 facilitates telomere replication by promoting efficient restart of stalled replication forks. ctc1 deletion results in increased loss of leading c‐strand telomeres, catastrophic telomere loss and accumulation of excessive ss telomere dna. our data demonstrate an essential role for ctc1 in promoting efficient replication and length maintenance of telomeres.
@background the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin contributes to barrier properties of mouse brain endothelial cells by stabilizing adherens junctions important insights into the molecular mechanism of t cell extravasation across the blood–brain barrier (bbb) have already been obtained using immortalized mouse brain endothelioma cell lines (bend). however, compared with bend, primary brain endothelial cells have been shown to establish better barrier characteristics, including complex tight junctions and low permeability. in this study, we asked whether bend5 and primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (pmbmecs) were equally suited as in vitro models with which to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell extravasation across the bbb. we found that both in vitro bbb models equally supported both t cell adhesion under static and physiologic flow conditions, and t cell crawling on the endothelial surface against the direction of flow. in contrast, distances of t cell crawling on pmbmecs were strikingly longer than on bend5, whereas diapedesis of t cells across pmbmecs was dramatically reduced compared with bend5. thus, both in vitro bbb models are suited to study t cell adhesion. however, because pmbmecs better reflect endothelial bbb specialization in vivo, we propose that more reliable information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell diapedesis across the bbb can be attained using pmbmecs.
@method a prospective stratified case-cohort study on statins and multiple adverse events in japan case-cohort data analyses often ignore valuable information on cohort members not sampled as cases or controls. the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study investigators, for example, typically report data for just the 10%-15% of subjects sampled for substudies of their cohort of 15,972 participants. remaining subjects contribute to stratified sampling weights only. analysis methods implemented in the freely available r statistical system (http://cran.r-project.org/) make better use of the data through adjustment of the sampling weights via calibration or estimation. by reanalyzing data from an aric study of coronary heart disease and simulations based on data from the national wilms tumor study, the authors demonstrate that such adjustment can dramatically improve the precision of hazard ratios estimated for baseline covariates known for all subjects. adjustment can also improve precision for partially missing covariates, those known for substudy participants only, when their values may be imputed with reasonable accuracy for the remaining cohort members. links are provided to software, data sets, and tutorials showing in detail the steps needed to carry out the adjusted analyses. epidemiologists are encouraged to consider use of these methods to enhance the accuracy of results reported from case-cohort analyses.
@background antiapoptotic effects of the peptidergic drug cerebrolysin on primary cultures of embryonic chick cortical neurons glutamate induced neurotoxicity has been proposed to account for the loss of neurons after ischemia as well as in the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. we have studied the effects of exogenous glutamate on survival of neurons from chick embryo telencephalon, precultured with a peptide derivative for 8 days. the peptide derivative cerebrolysin is a drug produced by standardised enzymatic breakdown consisting of 80% peptides and 20% amino acids. toxic effects of acute glutamate exposure were prevented by cerebrolysin in a concentration-dependent manner. 20 and 40 microliters cerebrolysin produce distinct neuroprotective effects. however, 80 microliters cerebrolysin/ml nutrition medium more than doubles neuronal viability compared to untreated control cells. these concentration-dependent effects of cerebrolysin were evident even at the light microscopic level.
@result effect of comt val108/158met genotype on risk for polydipsia in chronic patients with schizophrenia this case report concerns two schizophrenic patients with "psychogenic" polydipsia, without any underlying somatic disease. although case a showed a correlation between excessive water intake and severity of psychomotor disturbance, this could not be safely diagnosed as a water intoxication because the sodium serum level was normal. the lowered sodium serum level in case b, however, allowed us to conclude that the manifestation of grand mal was a sign of a genuine water intoxication. 27 casuistic studies on 67 patients with the syndrome of self-induced water intoxication in schizophrenics are then reviewed. finally, a variety of diagnostic and pathogenetic problems of this syndrome is discussed, with special reference to the role of inadequate adh secretion.
@result deficiency of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin adam8 is associated with thymic hyper-cellularity although notch plays a crucial role in t cell development, regulation of notch signaling in the thymus is not well understood. kuzbanian, an adam protease, has been implicated in the cleavage of both notch receptors and the notch ligand, delta. in this study we show that the expression of a dominant-negative form of kuzbanian (dnkuz) leads to reduced tcrβ expression in double-negative thymocytes and to a partial block between the double-negative to double-positive stages of development. these defects were rescued by overexpression of delta-1 on thymocytes. mixed chimeras showed a cell-autonomous block by dnkuz, but non-cell-autonomous rescue by delta-1. this suggests that dnkuz impairs notch signaling in receiving cells, and increasing delta-1 on sending cells overcomes this defect. interestingly, the expression of an activated form of notch-1 rescued some, but not all, the defects in dnkuz tg mice. our data suggest that multiple notch-dependent steps in early thymocyte development require kuzbanian, but differ in the involvement of other notch signaling components.
@method how do doctors refer to patient-reported outcome measures (proms) in oncology consultations? purpose to examine the effects on process of care and patient well-being, of the regular collection and use of health-related quality-of-life (hrql) data in oncology practice.   patients and methods in a prospective study with repeated measures involving 28 oncologists, 286 cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (regular completion of european organization for research and treatment of cancer-core quality of life questionnaire version 3.0, and hospital anxiety and depression scale on touch-screen computers in clinic and feedback of results to physicians); attention-control group (completion of questionnaires, but no feedback); or control group (no hrql measurement in clinic before encounters). primary outcomes were patient hrql over time, measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general questionnaire, physician-patient communication, and clinical management, measured by content analysis of tape-recorded encounters. analysis employed mixed-effects modeling and multiple regression.   results patients in the intervention and attention-control groups had better hrql than the control group (p =.006 and p =.01, respectively), but the intervention and attention-control groups were not significantly different (p =.80). a positive effect on emotional well-being was associated with feedback of data (p =.008), but not with instrument completion (p =.12). a larger proportion of intervention patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in hrql. more frequent discussion of chronic nonspecific symptoms (p =.03) was found in the intervention group, without prolonging encounters. there was no detectable effect on patient management (p =.60). in the intervention patients, hrql improvement was associated with explicit use of hrql data (p =.016), discussion of pain, and role function (p =.046).   conclusion routine assessment of cancer patients' hrql had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better hrql and emotional functioning.
@background identification of residues in the bst-2 tm domain important for antagonism by hiv-1 vpu using a gain-of-function approach backgroundthe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vpu protein enhances virus release from infected cells and induces proteasomal degradation of cd4. recent work identified bst-2/cd317 as a host factor that inhibits hiv-1 virus release in a vpu sensitive manner. a current working model proposes that bst-2 inhibits virus release by tethering viral particles to the cell surface thereby triggering their subsequent endocytosis.resultshere we defined structural properties of bst-2 required for inhibition of virus release and for sensitivity to vpu. we found that bst-2 is modified by n-linked glycosylation at two sites in the extracellular domain. however, n-linked glycosylation was not important for inhibition of hiv-1 virus release nor did it affect surface expression or sensitivity to vpu. rodent bst-2 was previously found to form cysteine-linked dimers. analysis of single, double, or triple cysteine mutants revealed that any one of three cysteine residues present in the bst-2 extracellular domain was sufficient for bst-2 dimerization, for inhibition of virus release, and sensitivity to vpu. in contrast, bst-2 lacking all three cysteines in its ectodomain was unable to inhibit release of wild type or vpu-deficient hiv-1 virions. this defect was not caused by a gross defect in bst-2 trafficking as the mutant protein was expressed at the cell surface of transfected 293t cells and was down-modulated by vpu similar to wild type bst-2.conclusionwhile bst-2 glycosylation was functionally irrelevant, formation of cysteine-linked dimers appeared to be important for inhibition of virus release. however lack of dimerization did not prevent surface expression or vpu sensitivity of bst-2, suggesting vpu sensitivity and inhibition of virus release are separable properties of bst-2.
@method the good, the bad, and the interested: how historical demographics explain present-day tree canopy, vacant lot and tree request spatial variability in new haven, ct in 2010 the american community survey (acs) replaced the long form of the united states decennial census. the acs is now the principal source of high-resolution geographic information about the u.s. population. the margins of error on acs census tract-level data are on average 75 percent larger than those of the corresponding 2000 long-form estimate. the practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difficult to use. this paper explains why the acs tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. statistical concepts are explained in plain english. acs margins of error are attributed to specific methodological decisions made by the census bureau. these decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance financial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. in addition, demographic and geographic patterns in acs data quality are identified. these patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality acs.
@background does the menstrual cycle influence the motor and phosphene thresholds in migraine? objective: to determine whether there are menstrual cycle–related effects on cortical excitability in normal women. background: ovarian steroid hormones affect neurotransmission in the brain. data from animal experiments have shown that progesterone metabolites enhance the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex, producing benzodiazepine-like (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam) physiologic and behavioral effects. estradiol has excitatory effects on measures of neuronal excitability, possibly acting through the glutamate system. these effects have been difficult to detect in women using conventional techniques. however, recently, paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) has been used to detect the effects of gabaergic and glutamatergic drugs in humans. we used this method to measure the effects of the menstrual cycle in normal women. methods: we tested 13 healthy women during the follicular (low-progesterone) and luteal (high-progesterone) phases of the menstrual cycle using paired tms. the effect of a subthreshold conditioning pulse on the cortex was tested by measuring the response to a second suprathreshold test pulse and comparing it with the response elicited by the test pulse administered alone. results: conditioning tms produced more inhibition in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (p = 0.01), of similar magnitude to the reported effect of benzodiazepine drugs. conclusions: this study provides the first direct evidence of changes in the excitability of a cortical network with the menstrual cycle. the results also show a potential confound for studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation in populations that include menstruating women.
@background nadph oxidase-2 does not contribute to β-cell glucotoxicity in cultured pancreatic islets from c57bl/6j mice aim/hypothesis rat pancreatic islet cell apoptosis is minimal after prolonged culture in 10 mmol/l glucose (g10), largely increased in 5 mmol/l glucose (g5) and moderately increased in 30 mmol/l glucose (g30). this glucose-dependent asymmetric v-shaped profile is preceded by parallel changes in the mrna levels of oxidative stress-response genes like metallothionein 1a (mt1a). in this study, we tested the effect of zncl2, a potent inducer of mt1a, on apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress and alterations of glucose-induced insulin secretion (gsis) induced by prolonged exposure to low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations. methods male wistar rat islets were cultured in rpmi medium. islet gene mrna levels were measured by rtq-pcr. apoptosis was quantified by measuring islet cytosolic histone-associated dna fragments and the percentage of tunel-positive β-cells. mitochondrial thiol oxidation was measured in rat islet cell clusters expressing “redox sensitive gfp” targeted to the mitochondria (mt-rogfp1). insulin secretion was measured by ria. results as observed for mt1a mrna levels, β-cell apoptosis and loss of gsis, culture in either g5 or g30 vs. g10 significantly increased mt-rogfp1 oxidation. while tpen decreased mt1a/2a mrna induction by g5, addition of 50–100 µm zncl2 to the culture medium strongly increased mt1a/2a mrna and protein levels, reduced early mt-rogfp oxidation and significantly decreased late β-cell apoptosis after prolonged culture in g5 or g30 vs. g10. it did not, however, prevent the loss of gsis under these culture conditions. conclusion zncl2 reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress and improves rat β-cell survival during culture in the presence of low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations without improving their acute gsis.
@method hyperreactive airway disease in adults: data from a national study in lebanon. the aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on the aetiology of asthma. the classic twin study design was used to analyse data on self-reported asthma obtained by a questionnaire mailed to 34,076 individuals, aged 12-41 yrs and originating from the danish twin register. the cumulative incidence of asthma was 6.2% in the pooled sample. the data showed a decreasing cumulative incidence with age for males, but no sex or zygosity difference was observed. substantially higher concordance rates, odds ratios and correlations for asthma were estimated in the monozygotic than in the dizygotic twins. using biometric modelling, a model including additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects provided the best overall fit to the data. according to this model, 73% of the variation in liability to asthma was explained by genetic factors. no sex difference or age-dependency in the magnitude of genetic effects was observed. the biometric analysis emphasized a major influence of genetic factors in the aetiology of asthma. however, a substantial part of the variation in liability to asthma is due to the impact of environmental factors specific to the individual. there is no evidence for a substantial impact of genetic dominance or the shared environment.
@method restoration of vagal tone: a possible mechanism for functional abdominal pain objective: to present current concepts about the diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain and to review the basis of the therapeutic approach for this disease in children and adolescents. methods: references were obtained from the medline, from recent review articles, and from personal files. books and dissertations were also analyzed. only the most important articles were included in this review. results: recurrent abdominal pain is the main cause of recurrent pain in children between 4 and 16 years of age. it is defined as the occurrence of three or more abdominal pain attacks within 3 months or less. these attacks are severe enough to interrupt routine activities, making the child remain asymptomatic between the episodes of pain. the diagnosis is based on a detailed clinical history, on an improved physical examination, and on a few laboratory tests. it can be manifested with isolated paroxysms of umbilical pain, abdominal pain with dyspeptic symptoms, and abdominal pain with digestive tract dysfunction. the treatment must emphasize the cognitive-behavioral factors of the recurrent pain. conclusions: the treatment of recurrent abdominal pain using the strategy presented here represents an equilibrium in which time is neither wasted nor insufficient during the investigative process required for treating children and their families with this problem.
@result what causes ior? attention or perception? – manipulating cue and target luminance in either blocked or mixed condition after presentation of a peripheral cue, facilitation at the cued location is followed by inhibition of return (ior). it has been recently proposed that ior may originate at different processing stages for manual and ocular responses, with manual ior resulting from inhibited attentional orienting, and ocular ior resulting form inhibited motor preparation. contrary to this interpretation, we found an effect of target contrast on saccadic ior. the effect of contrast decreased with increasing reaction times (rts) for saccades, but not for manual key-press responses. this may have masked the effect of contrast on ior with saccades in previous studies (hunt and kingstone in j exp psychol hum percept perform 29:1068–1074, 2003) because only mean rts were considered. we also found that background luminance strongly influenced the effects of gap and target contrast on ior.
@result effects of methylphenidate and morphine on delay-discount functions obtained within sessions. this experiment evaluated the effects of methylphenidate on reinforced responding in rats. in each session the subjects (rats) earned reinforcement on seven different variable-interval reinforcement schedules. the average intervals varied from 108 to 3 s and provided reinforcement rates ranging from about 30 to 1100/h. response rate was a negatively accelerated function of reinforcement rate. low doses of methylphenidate (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) increased responding maintained by the four leanest schedules, but had little effect on responding maintained by the three densest schedules. in contrast, an 8.0 mg/kg dose increased responding maintained by the three densest schedules and slightly decreased responding maintained by leaner schedules. a quantitative model of reinforced responding, referred to as the matching law or response strength equation, was fitted to the data. this equation has two parameters. on the basis of previous experiments, one was used to measure changes in reinforcement efficacy and the other was used to measure changes in motor performance. the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg doses changed the reinforcement parameter in the same way as did increases in deprivation and reward magnitude. the 8.0 mg/kg dose changed the motor parameter in the same was as did decreases in lever weight. it was concluded that methylphenidate increases reinforcement efficacy, and that the highest dose changed the topography of responding. the results are discussed in terms of the response strength equation, the rate dependency principle, and the question of how to interpret changes in reinforcement efficacy and motor performance.
@result neighborhood deprivation and maternal psychological distress during pregnancy: a multilevel analysis objectives we investigated the relationship between the depressive symptoms of older adults over time and the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they live.   methods we surveyed a random sample of 1325 new york city residents aged 50 years or older in 2005 and conducted 808 follow-up interviews in 2007. we assessed the compositional characteristics of the respondents' neighborhoods at a census-tract level and determined the relationships between these characteristics and changes in respondents' depressive symptoms.   results in multivariable models that adjusted for individual-level covariates including income, a range of neighborhood characteristics predicted worsening depressive symptoms. factor analysis suggested that these characteristics operated in 3 clusters: neighborhood socioeconomic influences, residential stability, and racial/ethnic composition, with positive neighborhood socioeconomic influences being significantly protective against worsening symptoms. life stressors, personality trait neuroticism, african american race, and daily baseline contact with social networks were also associated with worsening symptoms.   conclusions an older adult's neighborhood of residence is an important determinant of his or her mental health. those making efforts to improve mental health among the elderly need to consider the role of residential context in improving or impairing mental health.
@method fatty acid reesterification but not oxidation is increased by oral contraceptive use in women. arterial-venous concentration differences for individual free fatty acids (ffa) were measured across the deep tissues of the forearm, the splanchnic vascular bed, and the kidney in healthy, postabsorptive subjects. in addition, arterial-portal venous ffa differences were determined in five patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. the differences in fractional uptake among the individual ffa across the forearm were small and not statistically significant. splanchnic fractional uptake was high for ffa with short chain lengths and rose with increasing degree of unsaturation. small, negative arterial-portal venous differences for individual ffa were observed, indicating that arterial-hepatic venous ffa differences mainly reflect hepatic uptake. when the arterial ffa concentration was reduced to approximately 25% of the control values by the administration of nicotinic acid, net uptake of total ffa ceased but there was release of stearic acid and uptake of lauric, myristic, and palmitoleic acid to the splanchnic region. muscle and liver uptakes of individual ffa were both dependent on their arterial concentrations with the exception of the splanchnic uptake of stearic acid. there was no uptake of free arachidonic acid by either muscle or liver, nor was there significant uptake of any of the free fatty acids by the kidney. it is concluded (a) that there are important quantitative differences between the net exchanges of individual ffa across the splanchnic vascular bed, (b) that tracer studies of ffa metabolism require the determination of individual ffa specific activities, (c) that palmitic and oleic acid appear to be suitable tracers for the entire ffa fraction in most instances.
@background diabetes in the elderly. a unique set of management challenges. abstract a 46-yr-old hypertensive man treated for 1 yr with apresoline 200 mg and propranolol 240 mg daily, was admitted in deep coma, severely dehydrated, serum glucose 1130 mg100 ml without ketonemia, normal serum co 2 , blood ph 7.52, serum osmolarity 357 mosm/kg, fever of 105.6°f, and central venous pressure of less than 1 cm. the plasma free fatty acid was 270 μeg/liter, insulin 16 μu/ml and growth hormone 2.5 ng/ml. he responded excellently to 100 units regular insulin and 8 liters of hypotonic infusions. seven months later he had a similar episode despite addition of 1 g tolbutamide daily in the interim. when studied without any medication he had fasting hyperglycemia of 175–200 mg100 ml. an intravenous tolbutamide test was diabetic. when repeated following intravenous propranolol, 10 mg, the insulin response to tolbutamide was diminished. without propranolol or hypoglycemic therapy, fasting hyperglycemia increased over 5–6 wk to 630 mg100 ml, with traces of ketonemia, ffa level of 1350 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity of 305 mosm/kg. the study was later repeated with the addition of oral propranolol 240 mg daily. uncontrolled diabetes was again clinically manifest, although glucose levels rose more slowly. despite fasting glucose levels reaching 930 mg100 ml, no sign of ketosis occurred when the patient was taking propranolol. ffa level at this time was only 640 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity had risen to 335 mosm/kg. his diabetes is now satisfactorily treated with insulin injections, to avoid the disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism caused by propranolol. these studies indicate that large amounts of propranolol may precipitate hyperosmolar nonketotic coma in an untreated diabetic by a blockade of lipolysis and/or impairment of insulin response.
@method antidiabetic and cytotoxicity screening of five medicinal plants used by traditional african health practitioners in the nelson mandela metropole, south africa. a tetrazolium salt has been used to develop a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation. the assay detects living, but not dead cells and the signal generated is dependent on the degree of activation of the cells. this method can therefore be used to measure cytotoxicity, proliferation or activation. the results can be read on a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (elisa reader) and show a high degree of precision. no washing steps are used in the assay. the main advantages of the colorimetric assay are its rapidity and precision, and the lack of any radioisotope. we have used the assay to measure proliferative lymphokines, mitogen stimulations and complement-mediated lysis.
@background comparison of compression algorithms' impact on iris recognition accuracy ii: revisiting jpeg the resilience of identity verification systems to subsampling and compression of human iris images is investigated for three high performance iris matching algorithms. for evaluation, 2156 images from 308 eyes are mapped into a rectangular format with 512 pixels circumferentially and 80 radially. for identity verification, the 48 rows nearest the pupil were taken and the images were subsampled by fourier domain processing. negligible degradation in verification is observed if at least 171 circumferential and 16 radial fourier coefficients are preserved, corresponding to sampling at 342 by 32 pixels. with compression by jpeg 2000, improved performance is observed down to 0.3 bpp, attributed to noise reduction without significant loss of texture. to ensure that no algorithm is degraded, it is recommended that normalized iris images should be exchanged at 512 times 80 pixel resolution, compressed by jpeg 2000 to 0.5 bpp. this achieves a smaller file size than the proposed m1 biometric data interchange format
@method the protooncogene c-myb increases the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor messenger rnas by a transcriptional mechanism. complementary dnas encoding mouse liver insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) have been isolated and sequenced. alternative rna splicing results in the synthesis of two types of mouse igf-i precursor that differ in the size and sequence of the cooh-terminal peptide. the sequences of the signal peptides, igf-i moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the cooh-terminal peptides or e-domains of the two precursors are identical. the sequence difference results from the presence in preproigf-ib mrna of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the cooh-terminal peptide of preproigf-ib and also causes a shift in the reading frame of the mrna. as a consequence of this insertion, the cooh-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproigf-ia and -ib, respectively, are different. the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ia are highly conserved and possess 94% identity. in contrast, the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib are quite different in the region of the cooh-terminal peptide. a comparison of the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib mrna indicates that they are generated by different molecular mechanisms.
@result inhibition of bladder cancer invasion by sp1‐mediated btg2 expression via inhibition of dna methyltransferase 1 dye-ligand chromatography on cibacron blue f3ga-agarose has been used to resolve two species of dna (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase from nuclear extracts of uninduced friend murine erythroleukemia cells. each species has been highly purified; the activities in the first and second peaks were associated with polypeptides of mr 150,000 and 175,000, respectively. analysis of substrate specificity with synthetic dnas and restriction fragments of phi x174 replicative form dna and pbr322 dna showed that neither enzyme had dependence on the sequence context of cpg dinucleotides; poly(dg-dc) had the greatest methyl-accepting activity of any unmethylated dna substrate tested. de novo methylation by both enzymes was inefficient relative to methylation of hemimethylated sites. methyl-accepting activity was strongly dependent on dna chain length. this observation suggests that binding to dna, followed by one-dimensional diffusion of enzyme along the dna molecule, is important in the mechanism by which dna methyltransferase locates its recognition sites.

@background year : 2004 the hypoxia-induced paralogs scylla and charybdis inhibit growth by down-regulating s 6 k activity upstream of tsc in drosophila the inherited human disease tuberous sclerosis, characterized by hamartomatous tumors, results from mutations in either tsc1 or tsc2. we have characterized mutations in the drosophila tsc1 and tsc2/gigas genes. inactivating mutations in either gene cause an identical phenotype characterized by enhanced growth and increased cell size with no change in ploidy. overall, mutant cells spend less time in g1. coexpression of both tsc1 and tsc2 restricts tissue growth and reduces cell size and cell proliferation. this phenotype is modulated by manipulations in cyclin levels. in postmitotic mutant cells, levels of cyclin e and cyclin a are elevated. this correlates with a tendency for these cells to reenter the cell cycle inappropriately as is observed in the human lesions.
@result cupric ions induce the oxidation and trigger the aggregation of human superoxide dismutase 1 the kinetics of bovine cu,zn superoxide dismutase were studied by pulse radiolysis. to ensure the absence of catalytically active free copper, commercially obtained holo-superoxide dismutase was demetallated, and the apo-superoxide dismutase concentrations were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry prior to reconstitution with defined amounts of copper and zinc. the catalytic rate constant was determined as a function of ionic strength over the range of 4-154 mm, and of the copper and zinc content. the catalytic rate constant increases with ionic strength up to (1.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1) at an ionic strength of 15 mm, and then decreases. at ph 7 and 50 mm ionic strength, k = (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1), and at a physiologically relevant ionic strength of 150 mm, it is (0.7 +/- 0.1) x 10 (9) m(-1) s(-1). the effect of ionic strength is ascribed to the inhomogeneous electric field generated by the surface charges of superoxide dismutase. the value of the catalytic rate constant at 50 mm is ca. 2-fold smaller than earlier values reported in the literature. the relationship between copper content and the catalytic rate constant shows that addition of more than a stoichiometric amount of copper cannot be masked efficiently by edta. the possibility exists that earlier reported values were based on experiments contaminated with trace amounts of copper.
@background sumoylation is required for glycine-induced increases in ampa receptor surface expression (chemltp) in hippocampal neurons induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp) requires activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii), whereas maintenance of ltp additionally requires protein synthesis. we recently reported that camkii stimulates protein synthesis in depolarized hippocampal neurons through phosphorylation of the mrna translation factor cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (cpeb), and this phosphorylation is rapidly reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (pp1). protein synthesis-dependent late-phase ltp (l-ltp) in the hippocampus requires calcium influx through the nmda-type glutamate receptor (nmda-r) to activate camkii as well as concomitant inhibition of pp1 mediated by protein kinase a. therefore, we investigated the regulation of cpeb phosphorylation during l-ltp. pharmacological stimulation of the nmda-r in hippocampal slices to produce chemical long-term depression induced a brief dephosphorylation of cpeb. modest ltp induction (once at 100 hz), which induces a protein synthesis-independent early-phase ltp (e-ltp), resulted in a transient phosphorylation of cpeb. however, stronger stimulation (four times at 100 hz), known to induce protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp, elicited a prolonged phosphorylation of cpeb. furthermore, cpeb phosphorylation correlated with phosphorylation of pp1 inhibitor dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein, a known substrate for protein kinase a. these results evoke the hypothesis that bidirectional regulation of cpeb phosphorylation by camkii and protein phosphatases may serve as a mechanism to convert e-ltp into protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp by stimulating protein synthesis and thereby stabilizing synaptic enhancement.
@method the aspergillus nidulans f‐box protein grra links scf activity to meiosis backgroundthe construction of cdna libraries is a useful tool to understand gene expression in organisms under different conditions, but random sequencing of unbiased cdna collections is laborious and can give rise to redundant est collections.we aimed to isolate cdnas of messages induced by switching aspergillus nidulans from growth on glucose to growth on selected polysaccharides. approximately 4,700 contigs from 12,320 ests were already available from a cdna library representing transcripts isolated from glucose-grown a. nidulans during asexual development. our goals were to expand the cdna collection without repeated sequencing of previously identified ests and to find as many transcripts as possible that are specifically induced in complex polysaccharide metabolism.resultswe have devised a negative subtraction hybridization (nsh) method and tested it in a. nidulans. nsh entails screening a plasmid library made from cdnas prepared from cells grown under a selected physiological condition with labeled cdna probes prepared from another physiological condition. plasmids with inserts that failed to hybridize to cdna probes through two rounds of screening (i.e. negatives) indicate that they are transcripts present at low concentration in the labeled probe pool. thus, these transcripts will be predominantly condition-specific, along with some rare transcripts.in a screen for transcripts induced by switching the carbon source from glucose to 12 selected polysaccharides, 3,532 negatives were isolated from approximately 100,000 surveyed colonies using this method. negative clones were end-sequenced and assembled into 2,039 contigs, of which 1,722 were not present in the previously characterized glucose-grown cdna library. single-channel microarray hybridization experiments confirmed that the majority of the negatives represented genes that were differentially induced by a switch from growth in glucose to one or more of the polysaccharides.conclusionsthe negative subtraction hybridization method described here has several practical benefits. this method can be used to screen any existing cdna library, including full-length and pooled libraries, and does not rely on pcr or sequence information. in addition, nsh is a cost-effective method for the isolation of novel, full-length cdnas for differentially expressed transcripts or enrichment of rare transcripts.

@method diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis by using nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay a small number of entamoeba isolates from humans, the best known of which is the 'laredo' strain, have the ability to grow at room temperature. this peculiarity, along with other characteristics, distinguishes the strains from the human pathogen e. histolytica despite their being morphologically inseparable. in contrast, these 'e. histolytica-like' strains share several features with e. moshkovskii, which is most frequently isolated from polluted water. to examine the taxonomic relationships among these morphologically similar organisms, we have used polymerase chain reaction amplification of the small subunit ribosomal rna gene combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, 'riboprinting'. the results clearly show that the 'e. histolytica-like' amoebae are indeed strains of e. moshkovskii, and not closely related to e. histolytica.
@method normally-off stt-mram cache with zero-byte compression for energy efficient last-level caches spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (stt-mram) is a promising memory technology because of its advantageous features, such as nonvolatility, scalability, high density, zero-leakage, and cmos compatibility. however, one of its major drawbacks is the high overall energy consumption. to make matters even worse, the write process in stt-mram is of stochastic nature, i.e., the completion of a write operation is nondeterministic. however, if the read/write completion could be detected on the fly (i.e., dynamically) and the respective components could be turned-off immediately, the energy consumption can be reduced by a large extent. therefore, we propose a technique where the read and write completion signals are generated asynchronously on the fly using a self-timed bitwise technique. with this approach, the memory consumes power only when it is in the actual operational mode. experimental results show that this technique significantly reduces the energy consumption of read and write operations with negligible area overhead.
@background transcriptome characterization by rna sequencing identifies a major molecular and clinical subdivision in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. noncoding rnas transcribed from dna repeats in heterochromatin are expressed at surprisingly high levels in tumors. satellite repeats in heterochromatin are transcribed into noncoding rnas that have been linked to gene silencing and maintenance of chromosomal integrity. using digital gene expression analysis, we showed that these transcripts are greatly overexpressed in mouse and human epithelial cancers. in 8 of 10 mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (pdacs), pericentromeric satellites accounted for a mean 12% (range 1 to 50%) of all cellular transcripts, a mean 40-fold increase over that in normal tissue. in 15 of 15 human pdacs, alpha satellite transcripts were most abundant and hsatii transcripts were highly specific for cancer. similar patterns were observed in cancers of the lung, kidney, ovary, colon, and prostate. derepression of satellite transcripts correlated with overexpression of the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (line-1) retrotransposon and with aberrant expression of neuroendocrine-associated genes proximal to line-1 insertions. the overexpression of satellite transcripts in cancer may reflect global alterations in heterochromatin silencing and could potentially be useful as a biomarker for cancer detection.
@background differential regulation of disheveled in a novel vegetal cortical domain in sea urchin eggs and embryos: implications for the localized activation of canonical wnt signaling the dishevelled protein regulates many developmental processes in animals ranging from hydra to humans. here, we discuss the various known signaling activities of this enigmatic protein and focus on the biological processes that dishevelled controls. through its many signaling activities, dishevelled plays important roles in the embryo and the adult, ranging from cell-fate specification and cell polarity to social behavior. dishevelled also has important roles in the governance of polarized cell divisions, in the directed migration of individual cells, and in cardiac development and neuronal structure and function.
@background ion channels in nociceptors painful peripheral neuropathy often occurs without apparent underlying cause. gain-of-function variants of sodium channel nav1.7 have recently been found in ∼30% of cases of idiopathic painful small-fiber neuropathy. here, we describe mutations in nav1.8, another sodium channel that is specifically expressed in dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons and peripheral nerve axons, in patients with painful neuropathy. seven nav1.8 mutations were identified in 9 subjects within a series of 104 patients with painful predominantly small-fiber neuropathy. three mutations met criteria for potential pathogenicity based on predictive algorithms and were assessed by voltage and current clamp. functional profiling showed that two of these three nav1.8 mutations enhance the channel’s response to depolarization and produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons. these observations suggest that mutations of nav1.8 contribute to painful peripheral neuropathy.
@result results of an open posterior bone block procedure for recurrent posterior shoulder instability after a short- and long-time follow-up our purpose has been to describe an original surgical technique without describing all the problems concerning the posterior instability. the original technique has a double effect: active with the muscular flap and passively mechanic, if necessary, by the bone graft. five patients have been treated with this technique with a follow-up of one year and a half. 4 females and 1 male with an average age of 32 years 1/2. 2 were recurrent posterior instability, one unintentional and 2 intentional subluxations. 2 were epileptics. in all cases, the disparition of the instability was obtained. full range of movement and sport were resumed at the former level. on x-rays, the humeral head was centered. by its double mechanism, active with the muscular flap and possibly passive with the bone graft, this technic is reliable to treat the majority of posterior instability. it combines the way of action searched in physiotherapy and capsulomyoplasties to center the humeral head and this one by the bone graft in case of posterior glenoid fracture or dysplasia. it doesn't have the insufficiencies of physiotherapy or capsulomyoplasties in posterior traumatic instabilities, nor from the classical bone graft over the glenoid posterior wall, cause of osteoarthritis and pain.
@background preoperative low tri-iodothyronine concentration is associated with worse health status and shorter five year survival of primary brain tumor patients this study aims to evaluate the incidence of non-thyroid illness syndrome (ntis) among patients diagnosed as lung cancer and its association with the stage of the disease, eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance score, nutritional parameters, and survival. we enrolled 120 patients that 71 of them with newly diagnosed and staged non-small cell lung cancer and 49 of them small-cell lung cancer. the cases were examined for thyroid function tests, ecog performance score, and nutritional evaluation before treatment. also, cases were evaluated for their overall survival rates. ntis was identified in 30 (42 %) of the 71 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 22 (44 %) of the 49 small-cell lung cancer patients. ntis was more frequent among advanced stage of cases. serum albumin level, cholesterol level, lymphocyte level, and body mass index were detected to be significantly low and ecog performance score was significantly high in cases with ntis when compared to cases without ntis. ntis was found to be negatively correlated with body mass index, ecog performance score, and serum albumin level, and it was positively correlated with disease stage. ntis was detected significantly as a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer. ntis was frequently seen in cases with non-small cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. ntis can be used as a predictor of poor prognosis for lung cancer patients.
@background halide dependence of the halorhodopsin photocycle as measured by time-resolved infrared spectra. abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
@method change of muscle activation patterns in uphill cycling of varying slope despite the wide use of surface electromyography (emg) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. the aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. ten trained cyclists rode at 80% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4%, 7% and 10%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). two additional rides were made in standing at 4% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. for this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. emg was recorded from m. gluteus maximus (gm), m. vastus medialis (vm), m. rectus femoris (rf), m. biceps femoris (bf), m. semimembranosus (sm), m. gastrocnemius medialis (gas), m. soleus (sol), m. tibialis anterior (ta), m. biceps brachii (bb), m. triceps brachii (tb), m. rectus abdominis (ra) and m. erector spinae (es). unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the emg activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (gas, sol and ta). intensity and duration of gm, vm, rf, bf, bb, ta, ra and es activity were greater in standing while sm activity showed a slight decrease. in standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. these results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward.
@method modeling prehension for physical collaboration in virtual environments earlier studies have suggested that the size of an object to be grasped influences the time taken to complete a prehensile movement. however, the use of cylindrical objects in those studies confounded the effects of object size — extent orthogonal to the reach axis — and object width — extent along the reach axis. in separating these effects, the present study demonstrates that movement time is not affected by manipulation of object size, as long as the latter does not approach the maximal object size that can be grasped. object width, on the other hand, is shown to exert a systematic influence on movement time: smaller object widths give rise to longer movement times through a lengthening of the deceleration phase of the movement, thus reproducing the effect of target width on the kinematics of aiming movements. as in aiming, movement amplitude also affects the movement time in prehension, influencing primarily the acceleration phase (i.e. peak velocity attained). the effects of object width and movement amplitude were found to combine in a way predicted by fitts' law, allowing a generalisation of the latter to the transport component in prehensile actions. with respect to the grasp component, both object size and object width are shown to affect peak hand aperture. increasing object width thus lowers the spatial accuracy demands on the transport component, permitting a faster movement to emerge. at the same time, the hand opens to a larger grip in order to compensate for eventual directional errors that result. finally, with respect to the control mode of the grasp component, it was found that peak finger closing velocity scales to distance to be covered, defined as the peak hand aperture minus object size.
@method i‐prune: item selection for associative classification previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured data. however, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification is based on only a single high-confidence rule. the authors propose a new associative classification method, cmar, i.e., classification based on multiple association rules. the method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, fp-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated fp-tree, and mines large databases efficiently. moreover, it applies a cr-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. the classification is performed based on a weighted /spl chi//sup 2/ analysis using multiple strong association rules. our extensive experiments on 26 databases from the uci machine learning database repository show that cmar is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with cba and c4.5. moreover, our performance study shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods.

@method how functionalist and process approaches to behavior can explain trait covariation. in a large community sample (n=490), the big five were not orthogonal when modeled as latent variables representing the shared variance of reports from 4 different informants. additionally, the standard higher-order factor structure was present in latent space: neuroticism (reversed), agreeableness, and conscientiousness formed one factor, labeled stability, and extraversion and openness/intellect formed a second factor, labeled plasticity. comparison of two instruments, the big five inventory and the mini-markers, supported the hypotheses that single-adjective rating instruments are likely to yield lower interrater agreement than phrase rating instruments and that lower interrater agreement is associated with weaker correlations among the big five and a less coherent higher-order factor structure. in conclusion, an interpretation of the higher-order factors is discussed, including possible neurobiological substrates.
@method development of transcriptional fusions to assess leptospira interrogans promoter activity computational methods for automated genome annotation are critical to understanding and interpreting the bewildering mass of genomic sequence data presently being generated and released. a neural network model of the structural and compositional properties of a eukaryotic core promoter region has been developed and its application for analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome is presented. the model uses a time-delay architecture, a special case of a feed-forward neural network. the structure of this model allows for variable spacing between functional binding sites, which is known to play a key role in the transcription initiation process. application of this model to a test set of core promoters not only gave better discrimination of potential promoter sites than previous statistical or neural network models, but also revealed indirectly subtle properties of the transcription initiation signal. when tested in the adh region of 2.9 mbases of the drosophila genome, the neural network for promoter prediction (nnpp) program that incorporates the time-delay neural network model gives a recognition rate of 75% (69/92) with a false positive rate of 1/547 bases. the present work can be regarded as one of the first intensive studies that applies novel gene regulation technologies to the identification of the complex gene regulation sites in the genome of drosophila melanogaster.
@background ciliary neurotrophic factor controls progenitor migration during remyelination in the adult rodent brain in rodents, the adult subventricular zone (svz) generates neuroblasts which migrate to the olfactory bulb (ob) and differentiate into interneurons. recent work suggests that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) can enhance adult svz neurogenesis, but the mechanism by which it acts is unknown. here, we analyzed the role of bdnf and its receptor trkb in adult svz neurogenesis. we found that trkb is the most prominent neurotrophin receptor in the mouse svz, but only the truncated, kinase-negative isoform (trkb-tr) was detected. trkb-tr is expressed in svz astrocytes and ependymal cells, but not in neuroblasts. trkb mutants have reduced svz proliferation and survival and fewer new ob neurons. to test whether this effect is cell-autonomous, we grafted svz cells from trkb knock-out mice (trkb-ko) into the svz of wild-type mice (wt). grafted progenitors generated neuroblasts that migrated to the ob in the absence of trkb. the survival and differentiation of granular interneurons and calbindin+ periglomerular interneurons seemed unaffected by the loss of trkb, whereas dopaminergic periglomerular neurons were reduced. intra-ventricular infusion of bdnf yielded different results depending on the animal species, having no effect on neuron production from mouse svz, while decreasing it in rats. interestingly, mice and rats also differ in their expression of the neurotrophin receptor p75. our results indicate that trkb is not essential for adult svz neurogenesis and do not support the current view that delivering bdnf to the svz can enhance adult neurogenesis.
@background analysis of the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) gene in childhood and adolescent germ cell tumors chromosomal instability (cin), a hallmark of most colon tumors, may promote tumor progression by increasing the rate of genetic aberrations. cin is thought to arise as a consequence of improper mitosis and spindle checkpoint activity, but its molecular basis remains largely elusive. the majority of colon tumors develop because of mutations in the tumor suppressor apc that lead to wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and subsequent transcription of target genes, including conductin/axin2. here we demonstrate that wnt/beta-catenin signaling causes cin via up-regulation of conductin. human colon tumor samples with cin show significantly higher expression of conductin than those without. conductin is up-regulated during mitosis, localizes along the mitotic spindles of colon cancer cells, and binds to polo-like kinase 1. ectopic expression of conductin or its up-regulation through small interfering rna-mediated knock-down of apc leads to cin in chromosomally stable colon cancer cells. high conductin expression compromises the spindle checkpoint, and this requires localized polo-like kinase 1 activity. knock-down of conductin by small interfering rna in colon carcinoma cells or gene ablation in mouse embryo fibroblasts enforces the checkpoint.
@method on the role of the wideband inhibitor in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: a computational modeling study this paper presents a computational model to simulate normal and impaired auditory-nerve (an) fiber responses in cats. the model responses match physiological data over a wider dynamic range than previous auditory models. this is achieved by providing two modes of basilar membrane excitation to the inner hair cell (ihc) rather than one. the two modes are generated by two parallel filters, component 1 (c1) and component 2 (c2), and the outputs are subsequently transduced by two separate functions. the responses are then added and passed through the ihc low-pass filter followed by the ihc-an synapse model and discharge generator. the c1 filter is a narrow-band, chirp filter with the gain and bandwidth controlled by a nonlinear feed-forward control path. this filter is responsible for low and moderate level responses. a linear, static, and broadly tuned c2 filter followed by a nonlinear, inverted and nonrectifying c2 transduction function is critical for producing transition region and high-level effects. consistent with kiang's two-factor cancellation hypothesis, the interaction between the two paths produces effects such as the c1/c2 transition and peak splitting in the period histogram. the model responses are consistent with a wide range of physiological data from both normal and impaired ears for stimuli presented at levels spanning the dynamic range of hearing.
@method regulation of gene expression in hepatic cells by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) the gene expression omnibus (geo) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. geo provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. geo is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. the three central data entities of geo are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. a platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. a sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. a series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. the geo repository is publicly accessible through the world wide web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.
@background a technique of predicting radiographic joint line and posterior femoral condylar offset of the knee in 99 patients, 107 knee replacements were revised in two centers by two surgeons using a single revision total knee arthroplasty system. a retrospective radiographic review of joint line position before and after revision total knee arthroplasty was made, and compared with the joint line position before primary knee arthroplasty. prospectively collected knee society clinical rating scores were correlated with radiographic findings. the joint line position in unreplaced knee replacements averaged 16 mm, and the joint line position in knee replacements before revision surgery averaged 17 mm. the joint line was elevated by the revision total knee arthroplasty in 85 of 107 knees (79%). after the revision total knee replacement, the joint line elevation averaged 24 mm. the knee society clinical rating score after revision surgery averaged 131 points. if the joint line position was elevated more than 8 mm, the knee society clinical rating score averaged 125 points, if the joint line was elevated less than 8 mm, the score averaged 141 points. joint line elevation after revision total knee replacement is a problem. excessive elevation may result in worse clinical outcomes. distal femoral augments should be used more often and with greater thicknesses. standard implants used for revision surgery should have increased distal dimensions.
@background the role of the human hippocampus in odor-place associative memory. topographical disorientation (td) refers to impaired orientation and navigation in real-world environments. although numerous cases have been reported, disagreement over neuroanatomical correlates remains. this has been contributed to by concern with the "essential defect," ambiguous terminology, and incomplete assessments. attention to three factors permits a coherent understanding of the widely divergent descriptions of cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical findings: point in course (acute vs. chronic), characteristics of the environment, and a patient's specific cognitive deficits. defects in visual learning/recognition of topographical scenes or spatial-topographical knowledge are common, but the "agnosia" versus "amnesia" dichotomy is an oversimplification: careful assessment typically reveals impairment in both realms. anterograde td is most highly associated with medial occipitotemporal lesions in either hemisphere, especially posterior parahippocampal gyrus, whereas td consequent to right parietal damage tends to be time-limited. persistent retrograde td is attributable to right medial occipitotemporal lesions.
@method measurement, modelling and evaluation of computing systems we consider the optimal energy-aware control of a single server in a server farm. the server is modeled as an m/g/1 queue with a particular control policy that allows to put the server to a sleep mode to save energy with an additional delay cost, the setup delay, after the server is turned on again. our main result is the derivation of mean response time for such a system under srpt scheduling. in particular, we show that the mean response time can be decomposed into two parts: the mean response time of an ordinary m/g/1-srpt, and an additional penalty term for switching the server to a sleep state. furthermore, we study the energy-performance optimization of the system and prove that, for the energy response time weighted sum (erws) and energy response time product (erp) cost metrics, the optimal control either puts the server into a sleep state immediately when it becomes idle or keeps it idling until the next job arrives.
@method the recognition of mental illness, schizophrenia identification, and help-seeking from friends in late adolescence backgroundsurveys of the public in a number of countries have shown poor recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment that often diverge from those of health professionals. this lack of mental health literacy can limit the optimal use of treatment services. australia and japan are countries with very different mental health care systems, with japan emphasising hospital care and australia more oriented to community care. japan is also more collectivist and australia more individualist in values. these differences might influence recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment in the two countries.methodssurveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible. in both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. in australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over. in japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country.resultsthe japanese public were found to be more reluctant to use psychiatric labels, particularly for the depression cases. the japanese were also more reluctant to discuss mental disorders with others outside the family. they had a strong belief in counsellors, but not in gps. they generally believe in the benefits of treatment, but are not optimistic about full recovery. by contrast, australians used psychiatric labels more often, particularly "depression". they were also more positive about the benefits of seeking professional help, but had a strong preference for lifestyle interventions and tended to be negative about some psychiatric medications. australians were positive about both counsellors and gps. psychiatric hospitalization and ect were seen negatively in both countries.conclusionthere are some major differences between australia and japan in recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment. some of these may relate to the different health care systems, but the increasing openness about mental health in australia is also likely to be an explanatory factor.
@method tetrad gravity: ii) dirac's observables in the present article the geometry of semi-riemannian manifolds with nonholonomic constraints is studied. these manifolds can be considered as analogues to the sub-riemannian manifolds, where the positive definite metric is substituted by a nondegenerate metric. we study properties of the exponential map, the christoffel symbols and other differential operators are introduced. we study solutions of the hamiltonian system and their projections into the underlying manifold. the explicit formulae were found for a specific example of a semi-riemannian manifold with nonholonomic constraints.
@method the ubiquitous distribution of late embryogenesis abundant proteins across cell compartments in arabidopsis offers tailored protection against abiotic stress[c][w][open] few organisms are able to withstand desiccation stress; however, desiccation tolerance is widespread among plant seeds. survival without water relies on an array of mechanisms, including the accumulation of stress proteins such as the late embryogenesis abundant (lea) proteins. these hydrophilic proteins are prominent in plant seeds but also found in desiccation-tolerant organisms. in spite of many theories and observations, lea protein function remains unclear. here, we show that leam, a mitochondrial lea protein expressed in seeds, is a natively unfolded protein, which reversibly folds into α-helices upon desiccation. structural modeling revealed an analogy with class a amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins that coat low-density lipoprotein particles in mammals. leam appears spontaneously modified by deamidation and oxidation of several residues that contribute to its structural features. leam interacts with membranes in the dry state and protects liposomes subjected to drying. the overall results provide strong evidence that leam protects the inner mitochondrial membrane during desiccation. according to sequence analyses of several homologous proteins from various desiccation-tolerant organisms, a similar protection mechanism likely acts with other types of cellular membranes.
@result maternal separation anxiety as a regulator of infants' sleep. the relationships between aspects of parenting and infants' sleep patterns were studied longitudinally with 81 mother-child pairs. mothers' parenting orientation at 6 months was defined using the facilitator-regulator distinction. when the infants were 12 months old, mother and child participated in a laboratory-based developmental assessment which involved a brief separation episode. upon reunion, mothers reported on their concerns during separation; they also described their child's sleep. it was found that high maternal separation anxiety was related to night waking. in addition, night waking was more frequent among first born babies of facilitators compared with regulators. how maternal separation anxiety and care-giving orientation regulate aspects of the child's sleep awaits further explanation.
@method ocular dominance in extrastriate cortex of strabismic amblyopic cats abstract kittens are born with a large divergent strabismus. fourteen kittens observed daily from birth concurrently developed both visually guided behavior and normal interocular alignment during the second postnatal month. (interocular alignment is defined as the angle formed by the visual axes.) once achieved, this normal interocular alignment is resistant to a number if alterations in the cat's visual input. two cats with adult eyelid closure (one binocular, one monocular), 3 cats with adult unilateral visual cortex ablations, and 3 cats with adult transection of the optic chiasm along the sagittal midline did not develop strabismus. however, all 5 kittens reared with binocular eyelid closure and 9 of 10 reared with monocular eyelid closure developed a stable strabismus. the former all displayed a similar divergent strabismus whereas strabismus in the latter covered a wide range of interocular misalignments. a purely mechanical explanation is discarded sinceboth eyes of cats reared with monocular closure were similarly misaligned. these results indicate that cats require a normal, binocular visual environment during development to achieve the proper interocular alignment. it is hypothesized that during normal development, the binocular patterned visual input stimulates some part or parts of the cat's visual system to align the eyes properly. binocular closure results in no patterned stimulation, so the eyes remain diverged. monocular closure allows patterned stimulation through the open eye, and this initiates alignment which results in a wide range of errors due to the lack of data from the closed eye. apparently the visual system does not require the visual cortex for this alignment since 3 kittens reared with extensive visual cortex ablations made during the 8th postnatal day demonstrated the normal development of both visually guided behavior and interocular alignment.
@background dabrafenib inhibits the growth of braf‐wt cancers through cdk16 and nek9 inhibition braf inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with braf(v600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal. we sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with ras mutations, mutant braf amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. we also detected pi3k-pten-akt-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from braf inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to braf inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.
@background cyp2d6 gene variants: association with breast cancer specific survival in a cohort of breast cancer patients from the united kingdom treated with adjuvant tamoxifen purpose polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolizing genes affect the plasma concentration of tamoxifen metabolites, but their effect on clinical outcome is unknown.   methods we determined cytochrome p450 (cyp)2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotype from paraffin-embedded tumor samples and buccal cells (living patients) in tamoxifen-treated women enrolled onto a north central cancer treatment group adjuvant breast cancer trial. the relationship between genotype and disease outcome was determined using the log-rank test and cox proportional hazards modeling.   results paraffin blocks were obtained from 223 of 256 eligible patients, and buccal cells were obtained from 17 living women. cyp2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotypes were determined from 190, 194, and 205 patient samples and in 17 living women. the concordance rate between buccal and tumor genotype was 100%. women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype had worse relapse-free time (rf-time; p = .023) and disease-free survival (dfs; p = .012), but not overall survival (p = .169) and did not experience moderate to severe hot flashes relative to women heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. in the multivariate analysis, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype still tended to have worse rfs (hazard ratio [hr], 1.85; p = .176) and dfs (hr, 1.86; p = .089). the cyp3a5*3 variant was not associated with any of these clinical outcomes.   conclusion in tamoxifen-treated patients, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype tend to have a higher risk of disease relapse and a lower incidence of hot flashes, which is consistent with our previous observation that cyp2d6 is responsible for the metabolic activation of tamoxifen to endoxifen.
@result protease modulation of the activity of the epithelial sodium channel expressed in xenopus oocytes summarythe mammalian urinary bladder epithelium accommodates volume changes by the insertion and withdrawal of cytoplasmic vesicles. both apical membrane (which is entirely composed of fused vesicles) and the cytoplasmic vesicles contain three types of ionic conductances, one amiloride sensitive, an-other a cation-selective conductance and the third a cation conductance which seems to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. the transport properties of the apical membrane (which has been exposed to urine in vivo) differ from the cytoplasmic vesicles by possessing a lower density of amiloride-sensitive channels and a variable level of leak conductance. it was previously shown that glandular kallikrein was able to hydrolyze epithelial sodium channels into the leak conductance and that this leak conductance was further degraded into a channel which partitioned between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. this report investigates whether kallikrein is the only urinary constituent capable of altering the apical membrane ionic permeability or whether other proteases or ionic conditions also irreversible modify apical membrane permeability.alterations of mucosal ph, urea concentrations, calcium concentrations or osmolarity did not irreversible affect the apical membrane ionic conductances. however, urokinase and plasmin (both serine proteases found in mammalian urine) were found to cause an irreversible loss of amiloride-sensitive current, a variable change in the leak current as well as the appearance of a third conductance which was unstable in the apical membrane and appears to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. amiloride protects the amiloride-sensitive conductance from hydrolysis but does not protect the leak pathway. neither channel is protected by sodium. fluctuation analysis demonstrated that the loss of amiloride-sensitive current was due to a decrease in the sodium-channel density and not a change in the single-channel current. assuming a simple model of sequential degradation, estimates of single-channel currents and conductances for both the leak channel and unstable leak channel are determined.
@background impact of telomerase ablation on organismal viability, aging, and tumorigenesis in mice lacking the dna repair proteins parp-1, ku86, or dna-pkcs how a cell deals with its dna ends is a question that returns us to the very beginnings of modern telomere biology. it is also a question we are still asking today because it is absolutely essential that a cell correctly distinguishes between natural chromosomal dna ends and broken dna ends, then processes each appropriately – preserving the one, rejoining the other. effective end-capping of mammalian telomeres has a seemingly paradoxical requirement for proteins more commonly associated with dna double strand break (dsb) repair. ku70, ku80, dna-pkcs (the catalytic subunit of dna-dependent protein kinase), xrcc4 and artemis all participate in dsb repair through nonhomologous end-joining (nhej). somewhat surprisingly, mutations in any of these genes cause spontaneous chromosomal end-to-end fusions that maintain large blocks of telomeric sequence at the points of fusion, suggesting loss or failure of a critical terminal structure, rather than telomere shortening, is at fault. nascent telomeres produced via leading-strand dna synthesis are especially susceptible to these end-to-end fusions, suggesting a crucial difference in the postreplicative processing of telomeres that is linked to their mode of replication. here we will examine the dual roles played by dna repair proteins. our review of this rapidly advancing field primarily will focus on mammalian cells, and cannot include even all of this. despite these limitations, we hope the review will serve as a useful gateway to the literature, and will help to frame the major issues in this exciting and rapidly progressing field. our apologies to those whose work we are unable to include.
@background radiological features of childhood giant cavernous malformations cavernous angiomas of the central nervous system are angiographically occult vascular lesions and are easily diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (mri). giant cavernous angiomas (gca) are rare, with only 11 cases reported in the literature. imaging appearance of gcas has not been reviewed previously. we report a gca of the temporal lobe, and discuss its computed tomography and mri findings in the view of the literature. imaging appearance of gcas is variable. some gcas have features that are similar to those of typical cavernous angiomas, whereas some lesions may be purely cystic; and some present with significant contrast enhancement and mass effect, mimicking neoplasms. while the presence of hemosiderin, blood degradation products, and calcification may be helpful in the diagnosis of some cases, the correct diagnosis is not apparent until histopathological evaluation of the specimen is made in many instances.
@method associations of family-centered care with health care outcomes for children with special health care needs measurements of continuous variables are made in all branches of medicine, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. in clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being “hypertensive” or “obese” or having “high cholesterol,” depending on the value of a continuous variable.  categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1  what are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? a common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. a …
@background il-1 receptor/toll-like receptor signaling in infection, inflammation, stress and neurodegeneration couples hyperexcitability and seizures interleukin (il)-1beta is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in modulating inflammation and stress responses in the brain. central administration of il-1beta impairs both memory functions and long-term potentiation (ltp) induction. however, the molecular events responsible for the downstream effects of il-1beta are not fully understood. given the potential regulatory role of il-1beta in ltp, we assessed whether il-1beta influences surface expression and phosphorylation of glutamate receptors. we found that il-1beta, but not il-10 or tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, down-regulated the surface expression and ser831 phosphorylation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa) receptor subunit glur1. agents that block il-1beta receptor activity abolished these effects. in contrast, no change in the surface expression of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor subunit nr1 was observed. the inhibition of nmda receptor activity or depletion of extracellular calcium blocked il-1beta effects on glur1 phosphorylation and surface expression. nmda-mediated calcium influx was also regulated by il-1beta. these findings suggest that il-1beta selectively regulates ampa receptor phosphorylation and surface expression through extracellular calcium and an unknown mechanism involving nmda receptor activity.
@method the evolution of self-control class does not exist either, precisely since the relation between the two shadows compared is not a relation of simple comparison and common appurtenance to the same totality, but of substantial participation. the shadow perceived on the table is therefore no more an isolable object than is, on the sensorimotor plane, the watch which disappears under one cushion and which the child expects to see appear under another. but if there is thus an apparent return to the past it is for an opposite reason to that which obstructs objectification in sensorimotor intelligence; in the latter case the object is difficult to form in proportion as the child has difficulty in intercoordinating perceptual images, whereas on the plane of conceptual thought the object, already elaborated, again loses its identity to the extent that it is coordinated with other objects to construct a class or a relation. in conclusion, in the case of the object as in that of space, from the very beginnings of verbal reflection there is a return of the difficulties already overcome on the plane of action, and there is repetition, with temporal displacements, of the stages and process of adaptation defined by the transition from egocentrism to objectivity. and in both cases the phenomenon is due to the difficulties experienced by the child, after he has reached the social plane, in inserting his sensorimotor acquisitions in a framework of relationships of logical classes and deductive structures admitting of true generalisation, that is, taking into account the point of view of others and all possible points of view as well as his own. § 4. from sensori-motor universe to representation of the child’s world ii. causality and time the development of causality from the first months of life to the eleventh or twelfth year reveals the same graphic curve as that of space or object. the acquisition of causality seems to be completed with the formation of sensorimotor intelligence; in the measure that objectification and spatialisation of relations of cause and effect succeed the magico-phenomenalistic egocentrism of the primitive connections, a whole evolution resumes with the advent of speech and representative thought which seems to reproduce the preceding evolution before really extending it. but among the displacements to which this history of the concept of cause gives rise, distinction must again be made between the simple temporal displacements in extension due to the repetition of primitive processes on the occasion of new problems analogous to old ones, and the temporal displacements in comprehension due to the transition from one plane of activity to another; that is, from the plane of action to that of representation. it seems useless to us to emphasise the former. nothing is more natural than the fact that belief in the efficacy of personal activity, a belief encouraged by chance comparisons through immediate or phenomenalistic experience, is again found throughout childhood in those moments of anxiety or of desire which characterise infantile magic. the second type of temporal displacements, however, raises questions which it is useful to mention here. during the first months of life the child does not dissociate the external world from his own activity. perceptual images, not yet consolidated into objects or coordinated in a coherent space, seem to him to be governed by his desires and efforts, though these are not attributed to a self which is separate from the universe. then gradually, as progress is made in the intelligence which elaborates objects and space by spinning a tight web of relations among these images, the child attributes an autonomous causality to things and persons and conceives of the existence of causal relations independent of himself, his own body becoming a source among other sources of effects integrated in this total system. what will happen when, through speech and representative thought, the subject succeeds not only in foreseeing the development of phenomena and in acting upon them but in evoking them apart from any action in order to try to explain them? it is here that the paradox of displacement in comprehension appears. by virtue of the "why" obsessing the child’s mind, as soon as his representation of the world can be detached without too much risk of error, one perceives that this universe, centred on the self, which seemed abolished because it was eliminated from practical action relating to the immediate environment, reappears on the plane of thought and impresses itself on the little child as the sole understandable conception of totality. undoubtedly the child no longer behaves, as did the baby, as though he commanded everything and everybody. he knows that adults have their own will, that the rain, wind, clouds, stars, and all things are characterised by movements and effects he undergoes but cannot control. in short, on the practical plane, the objectification and spatialisation of causality remain acquired. but this does not at all prevent the child from representing the universe to himself as a large machine, organised exactly by whom he does not know, but organised with the help of adults and for the sake of the well-being of men and particularly of children. just as in a house everything is arranged according to a plan, despite imperfections and partial failures, so also the raison d’être for everything in the physical universe is the function of a sort of order in the world, an order both material and moral, of which the child is the center. adults are there "to take care of us," animals to do us service, the stars to warm us and give us light, plants to nourish us, rain to make the gardens grow, clouds to "make night," mountains to climb on, and lakes for boats, etc. furthermore, to this more or less explicit and coherent artificialism there corresponds a latent animism which endows everything with the will to play its role and with just the force and awareness needed to act with regularity. thus the causal egocentrism, which on the sensorimotor plane disappears gradually under the influence of spatialisation and objectification, reappears from the time of the beginnings of thought in almost as radical a form. doubtless the child no longer attributes personal causality to others or to things, but while endowing objects with specific activities he centers all these activities on man and above all on himself. it seems clear that in this sense we may speak of temporal displacement from one plane to another and that the phenomenon is thus comparable to the phenomena which characterise the evolution of space and object. but it is in a still deeper sense that the primitive schemata of causality are again transposed in the child’s first reflective representations. if it is true that from the second year of life the child attributes causality to others and to objects instead of reserving a monopoly on them for his own activity, we have still to discover how he represents to himself the mechanism of these causal relations. we have just recalled that corresponding to the egocentric artificialism which makes the universe gravitate around man and child is an animism capable of explaining the activity of creatures and things in this sort of world. this example is precisely of a kind to help us understand the second kind of temporal displacement of which we now speak: if the child renounces considering his actions as the cause of every event, he nevertheless is unable to represent to himself the action of bodies except by means of schemata drawn from his own activity. an object animated by a "natural" movement like the wind which pushes clouds, or the moon which advances, thus seems endowed with purposefulness and finality, for the child is unable to conceive of an action without a conscious goal. through lack of awareness, every process involving a relation of energies, such as the rising of the water level in a glass in which a pebble has been dropped, seems due to forces copied from the model of personal activity; the pebble "weighs" on the bottom of the water, it "forces" the water to rise, and if one held the pebble on a string midway of the column of the water the level would not change. in short, even though there is objectivity on the practical plane, causality may remain egocentric from the representative point of view to the extent that the first causal conceptions are drawn from the completely subjective consciousness of the activity of the self. with regard to spatialisation of the causal connection the same temporal displacement between representation and action is observable. thus the child can acknowledge in practice the necessity for a spatial contact between cause and effect, but that does not make causality geometric or mechanical. for example, the parts of a bicycle all seem necessary to the child long before he thinks of establishing irreversible causal series among them. however, subsequent to these primitive stages of representation during which one sees reappear on the plane of thought forms of causality relative to those of the first sensorimotor stages and which seem surpassed by the causal structures of the final stages of sensorimotor intelligence, one witnesses a truly reflective objectification and spatialisation, whose progress is parallel to that which we have described on the plane of action. thus it is that subsequent to the animism and dynamism we have just mentioned, we see a gradual "mechanism" taking form, correlative to the principles of conservation described in § 3 and to the elaboration of a relative space. causality, like the other categories, therefore evolves on the plane of thought from an initial egocentrism to a combined objectivity and relativity, thus reproducing, in surpassing, its earlier sensorimotor evolution. with regard to time, concerning which we have tried to describe on the purely practical plane of the first two years of life the transformation from
@background irreversible ototoxicity associated with difluoromethylornithine. this chapter summarizes the reported ototoxicity data on the most clinically important ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents, notably emphasizing the oto(neuro)toxicities of the more commonly administered platinum compounds, cisplatin and carboplatin. currently, in the united states, the only other marketed ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents are nitrogen mustard, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (dfmo), and the vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine sulfate); for these groups, animal ototoxicity data is sparse, and audiovestibular records of human ototoxicity are not available from most prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials. future phase i, ii, and iii clinical oncologic trials of "experimental" chemotherapeutic agents should include methodology for audiovestibular monitoring, just as present fda-approved cancer protocols with either monotherapy or combined therapy of known "ototoxic" agents should include standardized audiovestibular assessment in the database. finally, continued clinical application of cisplatin alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the successful treatment of solid tumors mandates decreasing or eliminating specifically the dose-dependent sensorineural hearing loss (partially in cases of complete or long-term partial remission) in addition to other common antiproliferation-induced side effects (nephritis, peripheral neuropathy, intractable nausea and vomiting, electrolyte imbalance, anaphylactic-like reactions, and myelosuppression). because of the chemotherapeutic superiority of cisplatin, it is essential to continue to investigate methods of altering the dose-limiting oto(neuro)toxicity without causing a "counterproductive" reduction of the antitumor activity of cisplatin (or other second- or third-generation ototoxic platinum agents).
@result the neisseria gonorrhoeae obg protein is an essential ribosome-associated gtpase and a potential drug target when grown under anaerobic conditions, neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, expresses several novel outer membrane proteins. one of these, pan 1, has an apparent molecular mass of 54 kda in electrophoresis and is recognized by serum samples from patients with gonococcal infection. the presence of antibodies to this protein in patient sera suggests that pan 1 is expressed during gonococcal infection and, more importantly, that n. gonorrhoeae grows anaerobically in vivo. we have cloned the pan 1 structural gene, ania, by screening a gonococcal lambda gt11 expression library with monospecific, polyclonal anti-pan 1 antiserum. three distinct immunoreactive recombinants, containing overlapping fragments of dna, were isolated and confirmed to be coding for pan 1 protein sequences. northern (rna blot) hybridization of an insert from an ania recombinant to total gonococcal cellular rna revealed the presence of a 1.5-kb transcript that was specific to rna from anaerobically grown gonococci, indicating that the ania gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and is monocistronic. to characterize the ania gene, we have sequenced the entire 2-kb region spanned by the overlapping recombinants. we have also performed primer extension analysis on rna isolated from aerobically and anaerobically grown gonococci in order to define the ania promoter region. two putative primer extension products specific to organisms grown anaerobically were identified by homology to known escherichia coli promoter sequences, suggesting that the regulation of ania expression involves multiple promoter regions.
@background post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth in 223 childhood cancer survivors: predictive risk factors confronting with a life-threatening illness may serve as an opportunity for self-renewal and spiritual and personal growth. posttraumatic growth refers to the experience of positive change resulting from the struggle and/or cognitive engagement with the existential challenges of life events. the more stressful a life situation is, the more potential it provides for personal growth. this article is a report of a narrative synthesis of empirical research reporting the positive effects of cancer perceived by the childhood cancer survivors and their families. a total of 35 studies included 20 quantitative, 12 qualitative, and 3 mixed studies (involving 2087 childhood cancer survivors, 1115 parents, and 159 healthy siblings). they were published between 1975 and 2010 and conducted in 9 countries. five themes were identified: (1) meaning-making, (2) appreciation of life, (3) self-awareness, (4) closeness and family togetherness, and (5) a desire to pay back society. the findings suggest that illness becomes our best teacher to get to know ourselves at a deeper level and the world in a new dimension with new meaning. working through an illness brings out our best, teaching us what life is all about.
@result prediction of drug clearance and drug-drug interactions in microscale cultures of human hepatocytes various incubation conditions of human hepatocytes were compared for their accuracy in predicting the in vivo hepatic clearance (clh) of model compounds. the test compounds were the highly cleared, low protein bound naloxone (in vivo clh = 25 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.6), the medium clearance, highly protein bound midazolam (clh = 12 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.04) and the low clearance, highly protein bound bosentan (clh = 3.9 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.02). each compound was tested in three ‘hepatocyte systems’, using resections from three donors, in the presence and absence of human serum. those hepatocyte systems were: conventional primary cultures, freshly isolated suspensions and cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes. except for a twofold overestimated clh for bosentan from conventional primary cultures, and despite variable cryopreservation recoveries, similar predictions of clh were recorded with all hepatocyte systems. moreover, the clh values obtained with cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes were similar to those obtained with freshly isolated suspensions. for midazolam and bosentan, the predicted in vivo clh was markedly higher in the presence of serum, whereas serum had little influence on the scaled-up clh of naloxone. in vivo, clh was properly approached for naloxone and bosentan (particularly from experiments in the presence of serum), but it was strongly underestimated for midazolam (particularly in the absence of serum). additional compounds need to be investigated to confirm the above findings as well as to assess why the clearances of some highly protein-bound compounds are still considerably underestimated.
@method excimer laser-assisted recanalisation of femoral arterial stenosis or occlusion caused by the use of angio-seal purpose: given the increasing number of percutaneously applied endovascular therapies, the incidence of access-related vascular complications can be expected to rise, particularly in association with those techniques requiring large sheaths or anticoagulation. the need exists for a safe, easy to use, and effective hemostatic technique to replace the labor-intensive method of manual compression. methods: a bioabsorbable, sheath-delivered vascular closure device (angio-seal™) has been developed that deposits a small collagen plug within the arterial wall to mechanically seal the puncture defect. an anchor connected by suture to the plug is first deployed in the arterial lumen and pulled flush against the interior arterial wall to guard against intraluminal deposition of the collagen. results: the angio-seal device was deployed successfully in 80 (96%) of 83 attempts involving common femoral arteries accessed for peripheral angioplasty (n = 30), coronary angiography (n = 30), and coronary angioplasty (n = 16). three popliteal artery access sites and one femoropopliteal bypass graft were also treated. hemostasis was immediate in 78 cases (98%); 2 sites required a 5-minute manual compression to effect a secure seal. three devices failed to deploy, and manual pressure was used to close the puncture. nondeployment did not cause any sequelae, and no complications were encountered with the technique. conclusions: this novel vascular closure device is quick (< 1 minute application time) and simple to use, providing a positive seal of common femoral artery puncture sites for both peripheral and coronary interventions. it appears to be a reliable alternative to standard manual hemostasis.
@method investigation of internal pressure gradients generated in electrokinetic flows with axial conductivity gradients in particle image velocimetry experiments where optical access is limited or in microscale geometries, it may be desirable to illuminate the entire test section with a volume of light, as opposed to a two-dimensional sheet of light. with volume illumination, the depth of the measurement plane must be defined by the focusing characteristics of the recording optics. a theoretical expression for the depth of the two-dimensional measurement plane is derived and it is shown to agree well with experimental observations. unfocused particle images, which lie outside the measurement plane, create background noise that decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image fields. results show that the particle concentration must be chosen judiciously in order to balance the desired spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image field.
@method for semi-supervised bilingual acoustic model training although phonetic lexicons are critical for many speech applications, the process of building one for a new language can take a significant amount of time and effort. we present a bootstrapping algorithm to build phonetic lexicons for new languages. our method relies on a large amount of unlabeled text, a small set of ’seed words’ with their phonetic transcription, and the proficiency of a native speaker in correctly inspecting the generated pronunciations of the words. the method proceeds by automatically building letter-to-sound (lts) rules from a small set of the most commonly occurring words in a large corpus of a given language. these lts rules are retrained as new words are added to the lexicon in an active learning step. this procedure is repeated until we have a lexicon that can predict the pronunciation of any word in the target language with the accuracy desired. we tested our approach for three languages: english,
@background gomisin n in the herbal drug gomishi (schisandra chinensis) suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase gene via c/ebpβ and nf-κb in rat hepatocytes. aim:  a herbal medicine, kampo inchinkoto (tj‐135), is used to treat jaundice and liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis. in the inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene expression. over‐production of nitric oxide (no) by inos has been implicated as a factor in liver injury. we examined interleukin (il)‐1β‐stimulated hepatocytes as a simple in vitro injury model to determine liver‐protective effects of tj‐135. the objective was to investigate whether tj‐135 influences inos induction and to determine its mechanism.
@method cytokine-induced nuclear factor kappa b activation promotes the survival of developing neurons nf-kappa b, which consists of two polypeptides, p50 (m(r) 50k) and p65/rela (m(r) 65k), is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in responses to infection, inflammation and stress. indeed, although developmentally normal, mice deficient in p50 display functional defects in immune responses. here we describe the generation of mice deficient in the rela subunit of nf-kappa b. disruption of the rela locus leads to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days of gestation, concomitant with a massive degeneration of the liver by programmed cell death or apoptosis. embryonic fibroblasts from rela-deficient mice are defective in the tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-mediated induction of messenger rnas for i kappa b alpha and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), although basal levels of these transcripts are unaltered. these results indicate that rela controls inducible, but not basal, transcription in nf-kappa b-regulated pathways.
@background targeted and nontargeted effects of ionizing radiation that impact genomic instability. centrosome amplification is common in myeloma and may be involved in disease pathogenesis. we have previously derived a gene expression-based centrosome index (ci) that correlated with centrosome amplification and was an independent prognostic factor in a small cohort of heterogeneously treated patients. in this study, we validated the prognostic significance of the ci in 2 large cohorts of patients entered into clinical trials and showed that a high ci is a powerful independent prognostic factor in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, whether treated by intensive therapy (total therapy ii) or novel agents (bortezomib). tumors with high ci overexpressed genes coding for proteins involved in cell cycle, proliferation, dna damage, and g(2)-m checkpoints, and associated with the centrosome and kinetochore/ microtubules. in particular, aurora kinases are significantly overexpressed in patients with high ci, with concordant increase in protein expression. human myeloma cell lines with higher ci are more responsive to treatment with a novel aurora kinase inhibitor. aurora kinase may represent novel therapeutic targets in these patients with very poor prognosis.
@method what clinical characteristics and radiographic parameters are associated with patellofemoral instability after kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty? rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component within 0°±10° is associated with better function after mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (tka). kinematically aligned tka has gained interest; however, the percentage of kinematically aligned tka within 0°±10° is unknown. the authors prospectively followed all patients who underwent tka for primary osteoarthritis between december 2011 and april 2012 (194 patients, 195 knees). each underwent kinematically aligned tka with manual instruments. aligning the anteroposterior axis of the tibial component parallel to the line that bisects the oval boundary of the lateral tibial condyle set internal/external rotation. removing bone from the posterior femoral condyles equal in thickness to the femoral component after correction for cartilage wear set internal/external rotation and anteroposterior translation of the femoral component. rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component was determined from a computed tomography scan of the knee. ninety-seven percent of kinematically aligned tka with fixed-bearing components had a rotational mismatch within 0°±10° (overall range, -11° to 11°). this percentage was higher and the range narrower than the 85% of tka within 0°±10° and the -14° to 16° range reported for mechanically aligned tka. the use of manual instruments to kinematically aligned tka reliably limited rotational mismatch to within 0°±10°, which has been associated with better function.
@background reduced total antioxidant level and increased oxidative stress in patients with deficit schizophrenia: a preliminary study dysregulation of free radical metabolism as reflected by abnormal erythrocyte activities of three critical enzymes of the antioxidant defense system (aods), i.e. superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) and catalase (cat), has been reported in schizophrenic patients. the present study examined the effects of haloperidol, a standard antipsychotic agent, on the aods enzymes, using a within-subject, repeated-measures, on-off haloperidol treatment design. the mean drug free period was 40 days. at baseline, there were no significant differences for all three enzymes between patients and age and sex-matched normal volunteers. during the drug-free condition, sod activity, but not gsh-px and cat activities, was significantly higher relative to normal control subjects. however, within-subjects both sod and gsh-px activities, but not cat activity, were higher in the drug-free condition compared to the treatment condition. no significant correlation was observed between sod activity and plasma haloperidol (or daily haloperidol dose) levels. smoking status, as assessed by the cotinine level, was unrelated to enzyme activities. in addition, none of the major aods enzymes showed significant differences between relapsed and clinically stable patients. these findings suggest that haloperidol may not have direct regulatory effect on aods enzyme activities and that sod and gsh-px activities may change in response to other factors such as change in symptom severity.
@method health-related and social factors predicting non-reemployment amongst newly unemployed the center for epidemiologic studies-depression scale (ces-d; l. s. radloff, 1977) assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms occurring over the past week. although it contains only 20 items, its length may preclude its use in a variety of clinical populations. this study evaluated psychometric properties of 2 shorter forms of the ces-d developed by f. j. kohout, l. f. berkman, d. a. evans, and j. cornoni-huntley (1993): the iowa form and the boston form. data were pooled from 832 women representing 6 populations. internal consistency estimates, correlations with the original version of the ces-d, and omitted-included item correlations supported use of the iowa form over the boston form when a shortened version of the scale is desired. regression statistics are provided for use in estimating scores on the original ces-d when either shortened form is used. factor analytic results from two populations support a single-factor structure for the original ces-d as well as the short forms.
@method dynamic load response of the lumbar spine in flexion the ultimate strength in flexion of 16 lumbar functional spinal units (fsu) was determined. the specimens were exposed to a combined static load of bending and shearing in the sagittal plane until overt rupture occurred (simulated flexion-distraction injuries). the biomechanical response of the fsu was measured with a force and moment platform. mechanical displacement gauges were used to measure vertical displacements (flexion angulation) of the specimens. photographs were taken after each loading step for determination of horizontal displacements and the centre of rotation. the lumbar fsu could resist a combination of bending moment and shear force of 156 nm and 620 n respectively, before complete disruption occurred. the tension force acting on the posterior structures was 2.8 kn. the flexion angulation just before failure was 20 degrees and the anterior horizontal displacement between the upper and lower vertebrae was 9 mm. the centre of rotation was located in the posterior part of the lower vertebral body. the bone mineral content in the vertebrae appeared to be a good predictor of ultimate strength of the lumbar fsu. knowledge of the biomechanical response of the lumbar spine under different static traumatic loads is a first step to better understand the injury mechanisms of the spine in traffic accidents.
@background functional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers locus control regions (lcrs) are defined by their ability, in transgenic assays, to direct high-level, tissue-specific expression of linked genes at all sites of integration examined and at moderately constant levels per gene copy. the most extensively examined lcr is that associated with the b-globin locus in mammals, where the b-globin genes reside in a linear array and are usually arranged in order of their developmental expression (fig. 1). the b-globin lcr consists of several dnase i hypersensitive sites (hss) spread over a region of 20–30 kb; the dna sequence associated with each of the hss contains numerous binding sites for erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors (for review, see grosveld et al. 1993; orkin 1995; martin et al. 1996; hardison et al. 1997). expression of stably integrated b-globin transgenes in the absence of the lcr occurs only at low levels and varies depending upon the site of integration, and so is said to be subject to position effects. the high level of expression driven by the lcr at ectopic sites appears to be the product of at least two separable activities, namely the establishment of an ‘open’ chromatin domain and direct gene activation. gene activation is also a property of enhancers, which are defined by their ability to direct high-level expression of linked genes in transient transfection assays. although enhancers typically also improve the expression of transgenes integrated into the genome, such expression varies among integration sites due to negative position effects. thus, unlike lcrs, enhancers are only capable of gene activation at a subset of genomic loci. presumably, lcrs subsume the function of enhancers along with a more dominant chromatin ‘opening’ activity that can override negative effects from neighboring regions. in the case of the b-globin lcr, 58 hs2 is known to act as an enhancer in transient transfection assays, but elements in addition to hs2 are required for lcr activity in single-copy transgenes (ellis et al. 1993, 1996). evidence from one study indicates that an otherwise intact human b-globin locus translocated near centromeric heterochromatin may be subject to a position effect (rees et al. 1994). thus, the distinction between enhancers and lcrs may only be one of degree, but in most transgenic assays is still measurable. given the apparent importance of lcrs in the regulation of many tissue-specific genes, the mechanism by which these elements function has been the subject of a great deal of debate. the currently predominant model for lcr function involves the establishment of an open chromatin domain encompassing the regulated genes, with subsequent gene activation accomplished by direct interactions between elements of the lcr and gene promoters by dna looping. in this review, we will summarize models for the establishment of active chromatin domains by lcrs and describe in detail the evidence for the looping model of long-distance gene activation. recent data, especially relating to the function of boundary elements and evidence for facilitators of enhancer and lcr function, indicate that simple lcr–promoter interactions are unlikely. based on these data, we propose an alternative to the looping model, which we term the linking model.
@background analysis of codon usage patterns in morus notabilis based on genome and transcriptome data. mrna degradation represents a critical regulated step in gene expression. although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. we show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mrna stability. genome-wide rna decay analysis revealed that stable mrnas are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mrnas contain predominately non-optimal codons. substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mrna destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mrnas encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. this work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mrnas and, ultimately, proteins.
@method rapidly expanding host range for puccinia psidii sensu lato in australia uredo rangelii (myrtle rust) is reported for the first time in australia — detected on 22 april 2010 — from agonis flexuosa, callistemon viminalis and syncarpia glomulifera. this taxon is morphologically distinct from puccinia psidii, the cause of guava rust, but dna sequence data place it in the p. psidii complex. surveys up to the end of may 2010 have detected u. rangelii on cultivated shrubs and trees at four properties (two cut flower farms and two wholesale nurseries) on the central coast of new south wales, with no records in native forest thus far. containment operations are currently underway on infected properties.
@background development of a new folate-derived ga-68-based pet imaging agent in some epithelial cells studied in vitro a membrane-bound folate receptor initiates the process for cell accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. this receptor was found to be gp38, an overexpressed, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein, recognized by two monoclonal antibodies, designated mov18 and mov19. using immunoblotting with mov19, radioimmunoassay with mov18 and 19, northern blot analysis, and radioligand binding when possible, we describe the limited expression of the folate receptor in a large number of normal tissues from four autopsies. the immunoblot technique detected as little as 40 pg (approximately 1 fmol) of receptor protein. choroid plexus consistently had the largest amount of folate receptor. other tissues containing substantial amounts of receptor included lung, thyroid, and kidney. the liver, intestines, muscle, cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord were immunologically nonreactive. folate receptor gene expression determined by northern blot analysis confirmed these observations. we also show that several malignant cell lines express significantly more receptor than normal epithelial cells or fibroblasts. specifically, malignant cells bound greater than or equal to 20 pmol [3h]folate/10(6) cells, while normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts bound less than or equal to 1 pmol radioligand/10(6) cells. we also demonstrate that 4 of 6 brain tumors overexpress the folate receptor. these studies reveal the limited normal tissue distribution of the folate receptor, a cell surface protein which may be a useful immunological or pharmacological target for the development of selective cancer therapy.
@method echocardiographic predictors for worsening of six-minute walk distances in patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). the subcommittee members initially agreed on the concepts of disease activity, damage and severity, defining severity as the total effect of disease on organ function. it was decided to start with the assessment of severity using the medsger's severity scale. a revised version of this scale was constructed. the rationale for the exclusion of other variables was provided.
@background the effects of periosteum removal on the osteocytes in mouse calvaria prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), a prostanoid synthesized from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway, is a modulator of physiological responses including inflammation, fever, and muscle regeneration. several patents have been filed that are related to pge(2), one of them being directly related to skeletal muscles. in this report, we first summarize the key patents describing inventions for the utilization of pge(2) for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, including skeletal muscle. in the second part of our work we present new and exciting data that demonstrates that pge(2) accelerates skeletal muscle myogenic differentiation. our discovery resulted from our recent and novel concept of bone-muscle crosstalk. bone and muscle are anatomically intimate endocrine organs and we aimed to determine whether this anatomical intimacy also translates into a biochemical communication from bone cells to muscle cells at the in vitro level. the effects of mloy4 osteocyte-like cell conditioned medium (cm) and three osteocyte-secreted factors, pge(2), sclerostin and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp-3), on c2c12 myogenic differentiation were evaluated using morphological analyses, a customized 96-gene pcr array, and measurements of intracellular calcium levels. mlo-y4 cm and pge(2), but not sclerostin and mcp-3, induced acceleration of myogenesis of c2c12 myoblasts that was linked with significant modifications in intracellular calcium homeostasis. this finding should further stimulate the pursuit of new patents to explore the use of pge(2) and the new concept of bone-muscle crosstalk for the development and application of inventions designed to treat muscle diseases characterized by enhanced muscle wasting, such as sarcopenia.
@background prolactin levels correlate with abnormal b cell maturation in mrl and mrl/lpr mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease the molecular crosstalk between the interleukin 7 receptor (il-7r) and the precursor to the b cell antigen receptor (pre-bcr) in b lymphopoiesis has not been elucidated. here we demonstrate that in pre-b cells, the il-7r but not the pre-bcr was coupled to phosphatidylinositol-3-oh kinase (pi(3)k) and the kinase akt; signaling by this pathway inhibited expression of recombination-activating gene 1 (rag1) and rag2. attenuation of il-7 signaling resulted in upregulation of the transcription factors foxo1 and pax5, which coactivated many pre-b cell genes, including rag1, rag2 and blnk. induction of blnk (which encodes the signaling adaptor blnk) enabled pre-bcr signaling via the signaling molecule syk and promoted immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangement. blnk expression also antagonized akt activation, thereby augmenting the accumulation of foxo1 and pax5. this self-reinforcing molecular circuit seemed to sense limiting concentrations of il-7 and functioned to constrain the proliferation of pre-b cells and trigger their differentiation.
@result glur1 phosphorylation and persistent expression of levodopa-induced motor response alterations in the hemi-parkinsonian rat background the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) kinase plays a key role in translational control of a subset of mrnas through regulation of its initiation step. in neurons, mtor is present at the synaptic region, where it modulates the activity-dependent expression of locally-translated proteins independently of mrna synthesis. indeed, mtor is necessary for different forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (ltm) formation. however, little is known about the time course of mtor activation and the extracellular signals governing this process or the identity of the proteins whose translation is regulated by this kinase, during mnemonic processing. methodology/principal findings here we show that consolidation of inhibitory avoidance (ia) ltm entails mtor activation in the dorsal hippocampus at the moment of and 3 h after training and is associated with a rapid and rapamycin-sensitive increase in ampa receptor glur1 subunit expression, which was also blocked by intra-hippocampal delivery of glur1 antisense oligonucleotides (aso). in addition, we found that pre- or post-training administration of function-blocking anti-bdnf antibodies into dorsal ca1 hampered ia ltm retention, abolished the learning-induced biphasic activation of mtor and its readout, p70s6k and blocked glur1 expression, indicating that bdnf is an upstream factor controlling mtor signaling during fear-memory consolidation. interestingly, bdnf aso hindered ltm retention only when given into dorsal ca1 1 h after but not 2 h before training, suggesting that bdnf controls the biphasic requirement of mtor during ltm consolidation through different mechanisms: an early one involving bdnf already available at the moment of training, and a late one, happening around 3 h post-training that needs de novo synthesis of this neurotrophin. conclusions/significance in conclusion, our findings demonstrate that: 1) mtor-mediated mrna translation is required for memory consolidation during at least two restricted time windows; 2) this kinase acts downstream bdnf in the hippocampus and; 3) it controls the increase of synaptic glur1 necessary for memory consolidation.
@background amitriptyline activates cardiac ryanodine channels and causes spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release solution properties of a drug and its partitioning into lipid bilayers were studied for drug extraction using several different techniques, such as surface tension, zeta potential, ultra filtration and uv-vis spectroscopy. from the surface tension study it was found that the presence of salt makes the drug molecules more surface-active. zeta potential revealed the adsorption of the drug into the liposome bilayers to be governed mostly by electrostatic forces. the drug retention volume was expressed as a capacity factor, k, and that was normalized with respect to the amount of the immobilized phospholipids. the k-values for the positively charged drug on the liposomes decreased in the presence of phosphate buffer due to the presence of the oppositely charged ions. the above methods can thus be used to understand the mechanism of drug-membrane interaction and quantification of drug absorption into liposomes.
@method hormonal regulation of beta-catenin during development of the avian oviduct and its expression in epithelial cell-derived ovarian carcinogenesis introductionbreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease encompassing a number of phenotypically diverse tumours. expression levels of the oestrogen, progesterone and her2/neu receptors which characterize clinically distinct breast tumours have been shown to change during disease progression and in response to systemic therapies. mi(cro)rnas play critical roles in diverse biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in several human neoplasms including breast cancer, where they function as regulators of tumour behaviour and progression. the aims of this study were to identify mirna signatures that accurately predict the oestrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr) and her2/neu receptor status of breast cancer patients to provide insight into the regulation of breast cancer phenotypes and progression.methodsexpression profiling of 453 mirnas was performed in 29 early-stage breast cancer specimens. mirna signatures associated with er, pr and her2/neu status were generated using artificial neural networks (ann), and expression of specific mirnas was validated using rq-pcr.resultsstepwise ann analysis identified predictive mirna signatures corresponding with oestrogen (mir-342, mir-299, mir-217, mir-190, mir-135b, mir-218), progesterone (mir-520g, mir-377, mir-527-518a, mir-520f-520c) and her2/neu (mir-520d, mir-181c, mir-302c, mir-376b, mir-30e) receptor status. mir-342 and mir-520g expression was further analysed in 95 breast tumours. mir-342 expression was highest in er and her2/neu-positive luminal b tumours and lowest in triple-negative tumours. mir-520g expression was elevated in er and pr-negative tumours.conclusionsthis study demonstrates that ann analysis reliably identifies biologically relevant mirnas associated with specific breast cancer phenotypes. the association of specific mirnas with er, pr and her2/neu status indicates a role for these mirnas in disease classification of breast cancer. decreased expression of mir-342 in the therapeutically challenging triple-negative breast tumours, increased mir-342 expression in the luminal b tumours, and downregulated mir-520g in er and pr-positive tumours indicates that not only is dysregulated mirna expression a marker for poorer prognosis breast cancer, but that it could also present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
@background oxygen-enhanced mri accurately identifies, quantifies, and maps tumor hypoxia in preclinical cancer models. because of its paramagnetic properties, oxygen may act as an endogenous magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent by changing proton relaxation rates. changes in tissue oxygen concentrations have been shown to produce changes in relaxation rate r1 of water. the aim of the study was to improve the sensitivity of oxygen enhanced r1 imaging by exploiting the higher solubility of oxygen in lipids (as compared with water) to sensitively monitor changes in tissue oxygen levels by selectively measuring the r1 of lipids.
@background the drosophila transcription factor adf-1 (nalyot) regulates dendrite growth by controlling fasii and staufen expression downstream of camkii and neural activity drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is alternatively spliced to generate multiple isoforms that vary only in a region between the calmodulin-binding domain and the association domain. this variation has been shown to modulate activation of the enzyme by calmodulin. in this study we examine the ability of seven of the drosophila isoforms to phosphorylate purified protein substrates and to be inhibited by a substrate analog, and the response of six of the isoforms to a mutant form of calmodulin (v91g) that was isolated in a genetic screen. significant variation in kms for eag, a potassium channel, and adf-1, a transcription factor, were found. in the case of the a peptide inhibitor, ac3i, there were significant variations in ki between isoforms. kact for v91g calmodulin was increased for all of the isoforms. in addition, one isoform, ri, exhibited a lower vmax when assayed with this mutant cam. these results indicate that the variable domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is capable of altering the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain and the activation response to calmodulin.
@background the accuracy of ultrasound in the pre-operative localisation of parathyroid lesions in primary hyperparathyroidism: a review of the literature aim: to evaluate the role of usg in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism and to compare its usefulness with that of scintigraphy scan and postoperative findings. material and methods: twenty-five patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism were subjected to usg of the neck and nuclear scintigraphy, followed by surgery. the results were independently analyzed and compared with per-operative findings. results: the 25 patients had a total of 28 abnormal glands: 22 solitary adenomas, and 6 multiple adenomas (two each in three patients). usg detected 20 out of 22 solitary adenomas and three out of six multiple adenomas. usg missed five abnormal glands, two of which were in the neck and three in the mediastinum. scintigraphy was positive in 26 abnormal glands, out of which 22 were single and four were multiple. two abnormal glands were missed: one in the neck and one in the mediastinum. conclusion: as limited neck dissection for primary hyperparathyroidism becomes increasingly popular, usg has been found to be a sensitive, specific, and easily available noninvasive investigation for parathyroid localization. it can be easily offered to patients as a method for preoperative localization prior to limited parathyroid surgery outside tertiary care settings.
@method identifying pleiotropic genes in genome-wide association studies from related subjects using the linear mixed model and fisher combination function for most human complex diseases and traits, snps identified by genome-wide association studies (gwas) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (gcta), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. gcta estimates the variance explained by all the snps on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular snp to the trait. we introduce gcta's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from snps, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the snps, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and gwas simulation. we focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the snps on the x chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. the gcta software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large gwas data sets.
@method modeling the response of a population of olfactory receptor neurons to an odorant olfactory receptors code the concentration of stimulating molecules into an impulse frequency message. patch-clamp recordings have now demonstrated, in the olfactory receptor cell membrane, a number of membrane conductances. some of them are gated by odorants, in the cilia, and depolarize the cell through camp- or ip3-sensitive channels, depending on the species. other conductances are activated by membrane depolarization and/or an increased intracellular ca2+ concentration; they participate in oscillating membrane potential changes during impulses and post-spike after-polarizations, and control the repetitive firing. original data relative to the resting potential and the impulse frequency coding of the odorant concentration are presented.
@result investigating cooperative behavior in ecological settings: an eeg hyperscanning study background performing mission tasks in a simulator influences many neurophysiological measures. quantitative assessments of electroencephalography (eeg) and electrocardiography (ecg) have made it possible to develop indicators of mental workload and to estimate relative physiological responses to cognitive requirements.   objective to evaluate the effects of mental workload without actual physical risk, we studied the cortical and cardiovascular changes that occurred during simulated flight.   methods there were 12 pilots (8 novices and 4 experts) who simulated a flight composed of 10 sequences that induced several different mental workload levels. eeg was recorded at 12 electrode sites during rest and flight sequences; ecg activity was also recorded. subjective tests were used to evaluate anxiety and vigilance levels.   results theta band activity was lower during the two simulated flight rest sequences than during visual and instrument flight sequences at central, parietal, and occipital sites (p < 0.05). on the other hand, rest sequences resulted in higher beta (at the c4 site; p < 0.05) and gamma (at the central, parietal, and occipital sites; p < 0.05) power than active segments. the mean heart rate (hr) was not significantly different during any simulated flight sequence, but hr was lower for expert subjects than for novices. the subjective tests revealed no significant anxiety and high values for vigilance levels before and during flight.   conclusions the different flight sequences performed on the simulator resulted in electrophysiological changes that expressed variations in mental workload. these results corroborate those found during study of real flights, particularly during sequences requiring the heaviest mental workload.
@method interactions between imidazoline i2 receptor ligands and acetaminophen in adult male rats: antinociception and schedule-controlled responding &na; a method to measure cutaneous hyperalgesia to thermal stimulation in unrestrained animals is described. the testing paradigm uses an automated detection of the behavioral end‐point; repeated testing does not contribute to the development of the observed hyperalgesia. carrageenan‐induced inflammation resulted in significantly shorter paw withdrawal latencies as compared to saline‐treated paws and these latency changes corresponded to a decreased thermal nociceptive threshold. both the thermal method and the randall‐selitto mechanical method detected dose‐related hyperalgesia and its blockade by either morphine or indomethacin. however, the thermal method showed greater bioassay sensitivity and allowed for the measurement of other behavioral parameters in addition to the nociceptive threshold.
@background visual landmark-directed scatter-hoarding of siberian chipmunks tamias sibiricus. it is well established that the hippocampal formation is critically involved in the acquisition of trace memories, a paradigm in which the conditioned (cs) and unconditioned stimuli (us) are separated by a temporal gap (solomon et al., 1986). the structure is reportedly not critical for the acquisition of delay memories, where the cs and the us overlap in time (berger & orr, 1983; schmaltz & theios, 1972). based on these results, it is often stated that the hippocampus is involved in "filling the gap" or otherwise associating the two stimuli in time. however, in addition to the presence of a temporal gap, there are other differences between trace and delay conditioning. the most apparent difference is that animals require many more trials to learn the trace task, and thus it is inherently more difficult than the delay task. here, we tested whether the hippocampus was critically involved in delay conditioning, if it was rendered more difficult such that the rate of acquisition was shifted to be analogous to trace conditioning. groups of rats received excitotoxic lesions to the hippocampus, sham lesions or were left intact. using the same interstimulus intervals (isi), control animals required more trials to acquire the trace than the delay task. as predicted, animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired during trace conditioning but not delay conditioning. however, when the delay task was rendered more difficult by extending the isi (a long delay task), animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired. in addition, once the lesioned animal learned the association between the cs and the us during delay conditioning, it could learn and perform the trace cr. thus, the role of the hippocampus in classical conditioning is not limited to learning about discontiguous events in time and space; rather the structure can become engaged simply as a function of task difficulty.
@background apoe stabilization by exercise prevents aging neurovascular dysfunction and complement induction the decline of cognitive function has emerged as one of the greatest health threats of old age. age-related cognitive decline is caused by an impacted neuronal circuitry, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. c1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade and powerful effector of the peripheral immune response, mediates synapse elimination in the developing cns. here we show that c1q protein levels dramatically increase in the normal aging mouse and human brain, by as much as 300-fold. this increase was predominantly localized in close proximity to synapses and occurred earliest and most dramatically in certain regions of the brain, including some but not all regions known to be selectively vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the hippocampus, substantia nigra, and piriform cortex. c1q-deficient mice exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity in the adult and reorganization of the circuitry in the aging hippocampal dentate gyrus. moreover, aged c1q-deficient mice exhibited significantly less cognitive and memory decline in certain hippocampus-dependent behavior tests compared with their wild-type littermates. unlike in the developing cns, the complement cascade effector c3 was only present at very low levels in the adult and aging brain. in addition, the aging-dependent effect of c1q on the hippocampal circuitry was independent of c3 and unaccompanied by detectable synapse loss, providing evidence for a novel, complement- and synapse elimination-independent role for c1q in cns aging.
@result perinatal factors associated with the development of cow's milk protein allergy. the concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin was measured in the sera of 47 preterm an term neonates during the first few days of life under standardised conditions after feeding with a cows' milk'based formula. preterm neonates, particularly those of less than 33 weeks' gestation, had higher serum concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin than term neonates given an equivalent mild feed. prior feeding with breast milk did not diminish the amount of beta-lactoglobulin absorbed. our results suggest tha te ability of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude antigenically intact food proteins increases with gestational age and that gut closure occurs normally before birth in man.
@background recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood and psychopathology: the mediator effect of self-criticism. three potential sources of error in retrospective reports of childhood experiences are documented: low reliability and validity of autobiographical memory in general, the presence of general memory impairment associated with psychopathology, and the presence of specific mood-congruent memory biases associated with psychopathology. the evidence reviewed suggests that claims concerning the general unreliability of retrospective reports are exaggerated and that there is little reason to link psychiatric status with less reliable or less valid recall of early experiences. nevertheless, it is clear that steps must be taken to overcome the limitations of retrospective reports and enhance their reliability.
@background plant jasmonate zim domain genes: shedding light on structure and expression patterns of jaz gene family in sugarcane the phytohormone jasmonate (ja) regulates a wide range of growth, developmental, and defense-related processes during the plant life cycle. identification of the jaz family of proteins that repress ja responses has facilitated rapid progress in understanding how this lipid-derived hormone controls gene expression. recent analysis of jaz proteins has provided insight into the nature of the ja receptor, the chemical specificity of signal perception, and cross-talk between ja and other hormone response pathways. functional diversification of jaz proteins by alternative splicing, together with the ability of jaz proteins to homo- and heterodimerize, provide mechanisms to enhance combinatorial diversity and versatility in gene regulation by ja.
@result mechanical analysis of arterial plaques in native geometry with oct wall motion analysis. background:the composition of an atherosclerotic plaque is considered more important than the degree of stenosis. an unstable lesion may rupture and cause an acute thrombotic reaction. most of these lesions contain a large lipid pool covered by an inflamed thin fibrous cap. the stress in the cap increases with decreasing cap thickness and increasing macrophage infiltration. intravascular ultrasound (ivus) palpography might be an ideal technique to assess the mechanical properties of high-risk plaques.technique:palpography assesses the local mechanical properties of tissue using its deformation caused by the intraluminal pressure.in vitro validation:the technique was validated in vitro using diseased human coronary and femoral arteries. especially between fibrous and fatty tissue, a highly significant difference in strain (p = 0.0012) was found. additionally, the predictive value to identify the vulnerable plaque was investigated. a high-strain region at the lumen-vessel wall boundary has an 88% sensitivity and 89% specificity for identifying such plaques.in vivo validation:in vivo, the technique was validated in an atherosclerotic yucatan minipig animal model. this study also revealed higher strain values in fatty than fibrous plaques (p < 0.001). the presence of a high-strain region at the lumenplaque interface has a high predictive value to identify macrophages.patient studies:patient studies revealed high-strain values (1–2%) in thin-cap fibrous atheroma. calcified material showed low strain values (0–0.2%). with the development of three-dimensional (3-d) palpography, identification of highstrain spots over the full length of a coronary artery becomes available.conclusion:intravascular palpography is a unique tool to assess lesion composition and vulnerability. the development of 3-d palpography provides a technique that may develop into a clinical tool to identify the high-risk plaque.hintergrund:die zusammensetzung einer atherosklerotischen plaque wird als wichtiger erachtet als deren stenosegrad. eine instabile läsion kann aufbrechen und eine thrombotische reaktion auslösen. die mehrzahl dieser läsionen enthält einen großen lipidreichen kern, der von einer dünnen entzündeten kappe bedeckt ist. der stress in der kappe erhöht sich mit abnehmender dicke der kappe und zunehmender makrophageninfiltration. die intravaskuläre ultraschall- (ivus-)palpographie könnte die ideale technik zur beurteilung der mechanischen eigenschaften von hochrisikoplaques darstellen.technik:die palpographie erfasst die lokalen mechanischen eigenschaften von gewebe mit hilfe der durch den intravaskulären druck erzeugten deformation.in-vitro-validierung:die methode wurde durch untersuchung erkrankter koronar- und femoralarterien validiert. insbesondere zwischen fibrösem und fetthaltigem gewebe ließ sich ein hochsignifikanter unterschied bezüglich der gewebsdehnung feststellen (p = 0,0012). zudem wurde der prädiktive wert für die diagnose einer vulnerablen plaque untersucht. eine stelle mit hoher dehnung an der gefäßoberfläche hat eine sensitivität von 88% und eine spezifität von 89% für die erkennung solcher plaques.in-vivo-validierung:in vivo wurde die technik in einem atherosklerotischen yucatan-minischwein-modell validiert. auch diese untersuchung zeigte höhere dehnungswerte in fetthaltigen gegenüber fibrösen plaques (p < 0,001). zudem hat das vorliegen hoher dehnungswerte an der plaqueoberfläche einen hohen prädiktiven wert für die erkennung von makrophagen.patientenstudien:patientenstudien ergaben hohe dehnungswerte (1–2%) in fetthaltigen plaques mit dünner kappe. kalzifiziertes material zeigte niedrige dehnungswerte (0–0,2%). durch die entwicklung der dreidimensionalen (3-d) palpographie wird die identifikation von stellen mit hohen dehnungswerten im kompletten koronarsystem möglich.schlussfolgerung:wie keine andere methode gestattet die intravaskuläre palpographie, zusammensetzung und vulnerabilität einer läsion zu beurteilen. die entwicklung der 3-d-palpographie stellt eine technik zur verfügung, die sich zu einem klinischen hilfsmittel zur identifizierung von hochrisikoplaques entwickeln könnte.
@result preparative and quantitative isolation of plasma lipoproteins: rapid, single discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation in a vertical rotor. abstract the separation of plasma lipoproteins into vldl, ldl, and hdl by a single 24-hr ultracentrifugation in swinging-bucket rotors is described. the mean recovery of loaded lipoprotein cholesterol is 89.3 ± 1.3%. the method employs a discontinuous salt gradient and separates vldl, ldl, and hdl as verified by cellulose acetate- and immuno-electrophoresis. the method offers some advantages for research applications.
@background control of the inflammatory macrophage transcriptional signature by mir-155 activated macrophages are described as classically activated or m1 type and alternatively activated or m2 type, depending on their response to proinflammatory stimuli and the expression of genetic markers including inos, arginase1, ym1, and fizz1. here we report that akt kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization, with akt1 ablation giving rise to an m1 and akt2 ablation resulting in an m2 phenotype. accordingly, akt2−/− mice were more resistant to lps-induced endotoxin shock and to dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis than wild-type mice, whereas akt1−/− mice were more sensitive. cell depletion and reconstitution experiments in a dss-induced colitis model confirmed that the effect was macrophage-dependent. gene-silencing studies showed that the m2 phenotype of akt2−/− macrophages was cell autonomous. the microrna mir-155, whose expression was repressed in naive and in lps-stimulated akt2−/− macrophages, and its target c/ebpβ appear to play a key role in this process. c/ebpβ, a hallmark of m2 macrophages that regulates arg1, was up-regulated upon akt2 ablation or silencing. overexpression or silencing of mir-155 confirmed its central role in akt isoform-dependent m1/m2 polarization of macrophages.
@method hypercapnia improves tissue oxygenation the partial rebreathing method of cardiac output estimation is reviewed with a particular focus on its application for continuous monitoring, rebreathing and implementations and from both a historical and technical perspective. the assumptions of the method are discussed as well as the various implementations. the nico monitor and rebreathing valve are described from a functional view. the clinical data including (a) comparisons between bolus thermodilution and continuous thermodilution in patients in the or setting, (b) comparisons to continuous thermodilution with both the baxter and abbott continuous cardiac output devices and (c) comparison between different means of shunt correction are presented. compared to conventional cardiac output methods, the partial co2 rebreathing technique is non-invasive, can easily be automated and can provide real-time and continuous cardiac output monitoring. taking advantage of modern sophisticated sensor and signal processing technology and integrating multiple monitored physiological variables the nico monitor is the first commercially available cardiac output system making use of the partial rebreathing of co2.
@result differential adaptive diffusion: understanding diversity and learning whom to trust in viral marketing the new social media sites — blogs, wikis, flickr and digg, among others — underscore the transformation of the web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. digg is a social news aggregator which allows users to submit links to, vote on and discuss news stories. each day digg selects a handful of stories to feature on its front page. rather than rely on the opinion of a few editors, digg aggregates opinions of thousands of its users to decide which stories to promote to the front page. digg users can designate other users as “friends” and easily track friends’ activities: what new stories they submitted, commented on or read. the friends interface acts as a social filtering system, recommending to user stories his or her friends liked or found interesting. by tracking the votes received by newly submitted stories over time, we showed that social filtering is an effective information filtering approach. specifically, we showed that (a) users tend to like stories submitted by friends and (b) users tend to like stories their friends read and liked. social filtering is a promising new technology that can be used to personalize and tailor information to individual users: for example, through personal front pages.
@background effects of external aba, ga3 and naa on the tiller bud outgrowth of rice is related to changes in endogenous hormones the iaal gene of pseudomonas syringae, subspecies savastanoi, encodes an indoleacetic acid (iaa)-lysine synthetase. to determine the effects of converting iaa to iaa-lysine in whole plants, the iaal gene was fused to a constitutive plant promoter and introduced into tobacco plants. biochemical analyses show that endogenous iaa is reduced by up to 19-fold in iaal plants. tobacco plants expressing the iaal gene display reduced apical dominance, reduced rooting, and inhibition of vascular differentiation. the phenotypic effects of iaal gene expression are reverted by crossing iaal plants with plants that overproduce iaa. these data indicate that iaal can act as an anti-auxin gene in vivo and confirm the role of auxin in the control of apical dominance, root growth, and vascular differentiation in whole plants.
@background progressive gait ataxia following deep brain stimulation for essential tremor: adverse effect or lack of efficacy? in this chapter brain imaging tools in neurosciences are presented. these include a brief overview on single-photon emission tomography (spet) and a detailed focus on positron emission tomography (pet) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). in addition, a critical discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the three diagnostic systems is added. furthermore, this article describes the image analysis tools from visual analysis over region-of-interest technique up to statistical parametric mapping, co-registration methods, and network analysis. it also compares the newly developed combined pet/ct scanner approach with established image fusion software approaches. there is rapid change: better scanner qualities, new software packages and scanner concepts are on the road paved for an amply bright future in neurosciences.
@background resting‐state functional connectivity of the human hypothalamus the hypothalamus integrates various hormonal and neuronal signals to regulate appetite and metabolism and thereby serves a homeostatic purpose in the regulation of body weight. additional neural circuits that are superimposed on this system have the potential to override the homeostatic signals, resulting in either gluttony or anorexia at the extremes. midbrain dopamine neurons have long been implicated in mediating reward behavior and the motivational aspects of feeding behavior. recent results reveal that hormones implicated in regulating the homeostatic system also impinge directly on dopamine neurons; for example, leptin and insulin directly inhibit dopamine neurons, whereas ghrelin activates them. here, i discuss the predictions and implications of these new findings as they relate to dopamine signaling and the physiology of appetite control.
@background dep domain‐containing mtor‐interacting protein in the rat brain: distribution of expression and potential implication the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway senses and integrates a variety of environmental cues to regulate organismal growth and homeostasis. the pathway regulates many major cellular processes and is implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the mtor pathway and its role in health, disease, and aging. we further discuss pharmacological approaches to treat human pathologies linked to mtor deregulation.
@method stochastic extended lqr for optimization-based motion planning under uncertainty we present extended lqr, a novel approach for locally-optimal control for robots with non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic cost functions. our formulation is conceptually different from existing approaches, and is based on the novel concept of lqr-smoothing, which is an lqr-analogue of kalman smoothing. our approach iteratively performs both a backward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-go functions, and a forward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-come functions. the states at which the sum of these functions is minimal provide an approximately optimal sequence of states for the control problem, and we use these points to linearize the dynamics and quadratize the cost functions in the subsequent iteration. our results indicate that extended lqr converges quickly and reliably to a locally-optimal solution of the non-linear, non-quadratic optimal control problem. in addition, we show that our approach is easily extended to include temporal optimization, in which the duration of a trajectory is optimized as part of the control problem. we demonstrate the potential of our approach on two illustrative non-linear control problems involving simulated and physical differential-drive robots and simulated quadrotor helicopters.
@background modification of gene expression, proliferation, and function of op9 stroma cells by bcr-abl-expressing leukemia cells in this study, we isolated cd31(-), cd34(-), cd106(-) (vcam-1(-)), and fetal liver kinase(+) (flk1(+)) cells from adipose tissue. these cells can be induced to differentiate into cells of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro and were termed adipose derived adult stem cells (adas cells). we also showed that they have characteristics of endothelial progenitor cells. in vitro, adas cells expressed endothelial markers when cultured with vegf. in vivo, adas cells can differentiate in response to local cues into endothelial cells that contributed to neoangiogenesis in hindlimb ischemia models. pi3 kinase inhibitor ly294002 blocked the differentiation of adas cells into endothelial cells in vitro. because adas cells can be expanded in culture without obvious senescence for more than 20 population doublings, they may be a potential source of endothelial cells for cellular pro-angiogenic therapies.
@method d c ] 1 2 fe b 20 13 hfsp : the hadoop fair sojourn protocol as organizations start to use data-intensive cluster computing systems like hadoop and dryad for more applications, there is a growing need to share clusters between users. however, there is a conflict between fairness in scheduling and data locality (placing tasks on nodes that contain their input data). we illustrate this problem through our experience designing a fair scheduler for a 600-node hadoop cluster at facebook. to address the conflict between locality and fairness, we propose a simple algorithm called delay scheduling: when the job that should be scheduled next according to fairness cannot launch a local task, it waits for a small amount of time, letting other jobs launch tasks instead. we find that delay scheduling achieves nearly optimal data locality in a variety of workloads and can increase throughput by up to 2x while preserving fairness. in addition, the simplicity of delay scheduling makes it applicable under a wide variety of scheduling policies beyond fair sharing.
@background large-scale expansions of friedreich's ataxia gaa repeats in yeast. recombination induced by double‐strand breaks (dsbs) in yeast leads to a higher proportion of expansions to contractions than does replication‐associated tract length changes. expansions are apparently dependent on the property of the repeat array to form hairpins, since dsb repair of a caa87 repeat induces only contractions of the repeat sequence. dsb‐repair efficiency is reduced by 40% when dna synthesis must traverse a cag98 array, as compared with a caa87 array. these data indicate that repair‐ associated dna synthesis is inhibited by secondary structures formed by cag98 and that these structures promote repeat expansions during dsb repair. overexpression of mre11p or rad50p suppresses the inhibition of dsb repair by cag98 and significantly increases the average size of expansions found at the recipient locus. both effects are dependent on the integrity of the mre11p–rad50p–xrs2p complex. the mre11 complex thus appears to be directly involved in removing cag or ctg hairpins that arise frequently during dna synthesis accompanying gene conversion of these trinucleotide repeats.
@background dna repair: lessons from the evolution of ionizing- radiation-resistant prokaryotes – fact and theory dehydration or desiccation is one of the most frequent and severe challenges to living cells. the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short dna fragments. remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. here we describe the relevant two-stage dna repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called ‘extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing’ (esdsa), followed and completed by crossovers. at least two genome copies and random dna breakage are requirements for effective esdsa. in esdsa, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. this synthesis depends on dna polymerase i and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become ‘sticky ends’ that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous dna fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. these intermediates require reca-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous dna blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by dna blocks synthesized after radiation.
@background local features in image and video processing - object class matching and video shot detection we present a new unsupervised method to learn unified probabilistic object models (poms) which can be applied to classification, segmentation, and recognition. we formulate this as a structure learning task and our strategy is to learn and combine basic pom's that make use of complementary image cues. each pom has algorithms for inference and parameter learning, but: (i) the structure of each pom is unknown, and (ii) the inference and parameter learning algorithm for a pom may be impractical without additional information. we address these problems by a novel structure induction procedure which uses knowledge propagation to enable pom's to provide information to other pom's and "teach them" (which greatly reduced the amount of supervision required for training). in particular, we learn a pom-ip defined on interest points using weak supervision [1, 2] and use this to train a pom- mask, defined on regional features, which yields a combined pom which performs segmentation/localization. this combined model can be used to train pom-edgelets, defined on edgelets, which gives a full pom with improved performance on classification. we give detailed experimental analysis on large datasets which show that the full pom is invariant to scale and rotation of the object (for learning and inference) and performs inference rapidly. in addition, we show that we can apply pom's to learn objects classes (i.e. when there are several objects and the identity of the object in each image is unknown). we emphasize that these models can match between different objects from the same category and hence enable object recognition.
@background new cck2 agonists confirming the heterogeneity of cck2 receptors: characterisation of bbl454 although it is known that panic attacks are triggered by the cholecystokinin fragment cck4, the specific involvement of peripheral or central cholecystokinin cck receptors in various adaptive processes such as emotion, memory and anxiety has yet to be demonstrated. with this aim, we have investigated the biochemical and pharmacological effects resulting from the administration of bc264, a highly potent and selective cck‐b agonist able to cross the blood‐brain barrier. very low doses of bc264 (μg/kg i.p.), increased the exploration of animals submitted to an unknown territory but were devoid of anxiogenic properties in the elevated plus maze. bc264 increased locomotion and rearings of rats newly placed in an open field and improved their spontaneous alternation in a y‐maze. the use of vagotomized animals showed that the increased alternation induced by bc264 did not require an intact vagus nerve, unlike the locomotor activation. these behavioural effects, prevented by the prior i.p. administration of the cck‐b antagonist l‐365,260 but not by the cck‐a antagonist l‐364,718, were shown to depend on dopaminergic systems, since they were blocked by d1 (sch23390, 25 μg/kg i.p.) or d2 (sulpiride, 50 or 100 mg/kg i.p.) antagonists. in addition, bilateral perfusion in freely moving rats of bc264 at pharmacologically active doses, using a newly designed microdialysis system, was found to increase the extracellular levels of da, dopac and hva in the anterior part of the nucleus accumbens. these results show that activation of cck‐b receptors by bc264 does not produce anxiogenic‐like effects but appears to improve motivation and attention, whereas other cck‐b agonists such as boccck4 induce anxiogenic responses. several explanations, including the existence of different sub‐sites of the cck‐b receptor, could account for these differential effects.
@background pathogen inducible voltage-dependent anion channel (atvdac) isoforms are localized to mitochondria membrane in arabidopsis abstract. in addition to the por1 gene, which encodes the well-characterized voltage dependent anion-selective channel (yvdac1) of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a second gene (por2) encoding a protein (yvdac2) with 50% sequence identity to yvdac1. mitochondria isolated from yeast cells deleted for the por1 gene (δpor1) had a profoundly reduced outer membrane permeability as measured by the ability of an intermembrane space dehydrogenase to oxidize exogenously added nadh. mitochondria missing either yvdac1 or both yvdac1 and yvdac2 showed a 2-fold increase in the rate of nadh oxidation when the outer membrane was deliberately damaged. mitochondria from parental cells showed only a 10% increase indicating that the outer membrane is highly permeable to nadh. in the absence of yvdac1, we calculate that the outer membrane permeability to nadh is reduced 20-fold. the low nadh permeability in the presence of yvdac2 was not due to the low levels of yvdac2 expression as mitochondria from cells expressing levels of yvdac2 comparable to those of yvdac1 in parental cells showed no substantial increase in nadh permeability, indicating a minimal role of yvdac2 in this permeability. the residual permeability may be due to other pathways because cells missing both genes can still grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. however, yvdac1 is clearly the major pathway for nadh flux through the outer membrane in these mitochondria.
@background non-neuronal roles for gdnf and novel gdnf family receptors abstract.glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-β family and has potent neurotrophic effects on several classes of neurons including dopamine neurons and motoneurons. here, we have used in situ hybridization to describe the development of the cellular expression of gdnf mrna pre- and postnatally. consistent with dopaminotrophic activity, gdnf mrna is expressed in the developing basal ganglia and the olfactory tubercle. it is also found in a thalamic nucleus, in neurons of the substantia innominata, in the developing purkinje neurons and the developing locus coeruleus area, and in trigeminal brainstem nuclei. in the spinal cord, neuronal expression is found in clarke’s column. gdnf mrna is also expressed in the dorsal horns during development. additional gdnf mrna expression in the head region includes the carotid body, the retina, the vibrissae, the inner ear, the ear canal, and epithelium in the nasal cavity. prominent expression is also found in the developing teeth. the widespread expression of gdnf in developing skeletal muscle is consistent with trophic activity on α-motoneurons. the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract are also strongly positive. a very strong signal is found in the outer mesenchyme of the developing metanephric kidney. we conclude that gdnf mrna is expressed in many different cellular systems inside and outside the central nervous system during development, suggesting multiple functions of gdnf in the developing organism.
@result impact of different water activities (aw) adjusted by solutes on high pressure high temperature inactivation of bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores the influence of ph, aw, l-alanine, and fat concentration of milk on the initiation of germination and inactivation by high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) (250 mpa at 25 degrees c for 15 min and 690 mpa at 40 degrees c for 2 min) of bacillus cereus sporulated at 20, 30 and 37 degrees c was investigated. b. cereus sporulated at the lowest temperature was found to be the most resistant to the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp. at ambient pressure, the rate and extension of germination induced by l-alanine were also lower in b. cereus sporulated at 20 than 30 or 37 degrees c. the optimum ph for the germination and inactivation of b. cereus depended on the sporulation temperature. at 250 mpa the extent of germination for the three suspensions increased with higher ph. at 690 mpa, the ph barely affected the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 20 degrees c (3 log cycles), but the inactivation increased as the ph of the medium was lowered. after the same treatment, pressure optimally initiated the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 30 and 37 degrees c (6-7 log cycles) around neutral ph. higher inactivation was obtained at ph 6. high concentrations of sucrose protected the spores from the germinating and inactivating effect of hhp. at aw 0.92, no germination was detected when the spores were pressurized at 250 mpa, and only 1 log cycle of b. cereus sporulated at 20 and 30 degrees c and 2 log cycles of b. cereus sporulated at 37 degrees c were germinated at 690 mpa. in addition, no inactivation was observed at aw 0.92 even at 690 mpa. the presence of l-alanine in the medium of pressurization increased the germination initiated by hhp at 250 mpa, but not at 690 mpa. a combination of 250 mpa at 25 degrees c with l-alanine (100 mm) was found to give an additive response. the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp were not affected by the fat concentration of the milk.
@result are there health benefits associated with comprehensive smoke-free laws background— secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction (ami). one study (helena, mont) examined the issue and found a decrease in ami associated with a smoke-free ordinance. we sought to determine the impact of a smoke-free ordinance on ami admission rates in another geographically isolated community (pueblo, colo). methods and results— we assessed ami hospitalizations in pueblo during a 3-year period, 1.5 years before and 1.5 years after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance. we compared the ami hospitalization rates among individuals residing within city limits, the area where the ordinance applied, versus those outside city limits. we also compared ami rates during this time period with another geographically isolated but proximal community, el paso county, colo, that did not have an ordinance. a total of 855 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of primary ami in pueblo between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2004. a reduction in ami hospitalizations was observed in the period after the ordinance among pueblo city limit residents (relative risk [rr]=0.73, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.63 to 0.85). no significant changes in ami rates were observed among residents outside city limits (rr=0.85, 95% ci 0.63 to 1.16) or in el paso county during the same period (rr=0.97, 95% ci 0.89 to 1.06). the reduction in ami rate within pueblo differed significantly from changes in the external control group (el paso county) even after adjustment for seasonal trends (p<0.001). conclusions— a public ordinance reducing exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with a decrease in ami hospitalizations in pueblo, colo, which supports previous data from a smaller study.
@result the effects of constraining eye movements on visually evoked steering responses during walking in a virtual environment a fundamental property of the human brain is the ability to make predictions of future sensory and motor events. we have recently found that steering manoeuvres when walking along curvilinear trajectories are controlled by an anticipatory guidance of the direction of head (and eyes). however it is unclear whether a time-related or space-related signal triggers such anticipatory head orienting movements. by simulating navigation along a multi-legged virtual corridor we show that anticipatory orienting movements are triggered (in standing subjects) by reaching specific locations rather than by the time to the approaching corridor's bend. similar to what happens in car driving, specific spatial features of the route rather than time to collision seem to drive steering.
@result a flash-lag effect in random motion a flash that is presented aligned with a moving stimulus appears to lag behind the position of the moving stimulus. this flash-lag phenomenon reflects a processing advantage for moving stimuli (metzger, w. (1932) psychologische forschung 16, 176-200; mackay, d. m. (1958) nature 181, 507-508; nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257; purushothaman, g., patel, s.s., bedell, h.e., & ogmen, h. (1998) nature 396, 424; whitney, d. & murakami, i. (1998) nature neuroscience 1, 656-657). the present study measures the sensitivity of the illusion to unpredictable changes in the direction of motion. a moving stimulus translated upwards and then made a 90 degrees turn leftward or rightward. the flash-lag illusion was measured and it was found that, although the change in direction was unpredictable, the flash was still perceived to lag behind the moving stimulus at all points along the trajectory, a finding that is at odds with the extrapolation hypothesis (nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257). the results suggest that there is a shorter latency of the neural response to motion even during unpredictable changes in direction. the latency facilitation therefore appears to be omnidirectional rather than specific to a predictable path of motion (grzywacz, n. m. & amthor, f. r. (1993) journal of neurophysiology 69, 2188-2199).
@method guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis objective because of the pressure for timely, informed decisions in public health and clinical practice and the explosion of information in the scientific literature, research results must be synthesized. meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. a workshop was held in atlanta, ga, in april 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.   participants twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. funding for this activity was provided by the centers for disease control and prevention.   evidence we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using medline, educational research information center (eric), psyclit, and the current index to statistics. we also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.   consensus process from the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. the checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. all suggestions for revisions were addressed.   conclusions the proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. an evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.
@background the genomic footprint of climate adaptation in chironomus riparius patterns of genetic diversity between populations are often used to detect loci under selection in genome scans. indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high fst values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low fst values. most tests of selection based on fst use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. in this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. we show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (str) data. an application to human and stickleback str data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model. the elimination of false positive loci from genome scans should allow us to better determine on which specific class of genes selection is operating.
@method anthropometric index for pectus excavatum. this paper contains an analysis of the long-term results in 85 patients who had pectus excavatum or carinatum deformities repaired at the north middlesex hospital between 1951 and 1977. seventy-seven patients had operations for correction of pectus excavatum and eight for pectus carinatum. a variety of surgical techniques was used. in the excavatum deformities the best results were obtained by the extensive resection of all deformed cartilages, the correction of the sternal deformity by a simple transverse wedge osteotomy, and by stabilising the chest with a stainless steel plate. for pectus carinatum, the involved cartilages were resected and an osteotomy of the sternum was performed. we preferred in most cases to stabilise the chest wall with a metal strut in this deformity as well. the best cosmetic results were achieved by the use of a stainless steel plate passed beneath the sternum and left for not more than six months.
@background interaction between amyloid beta peptide and an aggregation blocker peptide mimicking islet amyloid polypeptide amyloid aggregates have been recognized to be a pathological hallmark of several fatal diseases, including alzheimer's disease, the prion-related diseases, and type ii diabetes. pancreatic amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid consisting of islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp). we followed the steps preceding iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation in vitro using a variety of biochemical methods, including a filtration assay, far and near-uv circular dichroism (cd) spectropolarimetry, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ans) binding, and atomic force (afm) and electron (em) microscopy. iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation followed kinetics that were consistent with the nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. nucleation of iapp amyloid formation with traces of preformed fibrils induced a rapid conformational transition into beta-sheets that subsequently aggregated into insoluble amyloid fibrils. transition proceeded via a molten globule-like conformeric state with large contents of secondary structure, fluctuating tertiary and quaternary aromatic interactions, and strongly solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches. in the temperature denaturation pathway at 5 microm peptide, we found that this state was mostly populated at about 45 degrees c, and either aggregated rapidly into amyloid by prolonged exposure to this temperature, or melted into denaturated but still structured iapp, when heated further to 65 degrees c. the state at 45 degrees c was also found to be populated at 4.25 m gdnhcl at 25 degrees c during gdnhcl-induced equilibrium denaturation, and was stable in solution for several hours before aggregating into amyloid fibrils. our studies suggested that this amyloidogenic state was a self-associated form of an aggregation-prone, partially folded state of iapp. we propose that this partially folded population and its self-associated forms are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with a non-amyloidogenic iapp conformer and may act as early, soluble precursors of beta-sheet and amyloid formation. our findings on the molecular mechanism of iapp amyloid formation in vitro should assist in gaining insight into the pathogenesis and inhibition of pancreatic amyloidosis and other amyloid-related diseases.
@result cytotoxicity of different sized tio2 nanoparticles in mouse macrophages nanotitanium dioxide (tio2) is an important industrial material that is widely used as an additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants. although the small size of the tio2 nanoparticle is useful in various applications, the biosafety of this material needs to be evaluated. in this study, mouse fibroblast (l929) cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different concentrations (3-600 microg/ml) of homogeneous and weakly aggregated tio2 nanoparticles in aqueous solution. the l929 cells became round and even shrank as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased. moreover, tio2 nanoparticle-treated cells had condensed fragmented chromatin or were directly necrosed, as observed by acridine orange (ao) staining. the transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis showed that in cells cultured in a medium containing 300 microg/ml tio2, the number of lysosomes increased, and some cytoplasmic organelles were damaged. in addition, there was a significant increase in oxidative stress at higher tio2 nanoparticle concentrations (>60 microg/ml). as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased in the culture medium, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) increased, while those of methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (mtt), glutathione (gsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod) decreased. a possible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of tio2 nanoparticles is also discussed.
@background laccase from the white-rot fungus trametes trogii a veratryl alcohol oxidase (vao) enzyme was discovered in cultures of pleurotus ostreatus. the enzyme, which oxidizes veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde reducing o2 to h2o2, was purified to homogeneity and its main structural and catalytic properties have been determined. the enzyme is a glycoprotein and contains fad as a prosthetic group. the amino acid composition and carboxy- and amino-terminal sequences were determined. primary aromatic alcohols with methoxy substituents in position four are good substrates for vao; cinnamyl alcohol is the substrate which is oxidized faster whereas coniferyl alcohol is oxidized at a slower rate. the enzyme is moderately thermostable (t1/2(55 degrees c) about 1.5 h, apparent melting temperature about 60 degrees c). the enzyme stability in 50% water/organic solvents mixtures has also been studied.
@method signal transduction of aortic and carotid sinus baroreceptors is not modified by central command during spontaneous motor activity in decerebrate cats. animals decerebrated at the precollicular-premammillary body level exhibit spontaneous locomotion without any artificial stimulation. our laboratory reported that the cardiovascular and autonomic responses at the onset of spontaneous locomotor events are evoked by central command, generated from the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem (matsukawa k, murata j, and wada t. am j physiol heart circ physiol 275: h1115-h1121, 1998). in this study, we examined whether central command and/or a reflex resulting from muscle afferents modulates arterial baroreflex function using a decerebrate cat model. the baroreflex was evoked by stimulating the aortic depressor nerve (adn) at the onset of spontaneous muscle contraction (to test the possible influence of central command) and during electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch (to test the possible influence of the muscle reflex). when the adn was stimulated at rest, heart rate and arterial blood pressure decreased by 40 +/- 2 beats/min and 11 +/- 1 mmhg, respectively. the baroreflex bradycardia was attenuated to 55 +/- 4% at the onset of spontaneous contraction. the attenuating effect on the baroreflex bradycardia was not observed at the onset and middle of electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch. the depressor response to adn stimulation was identical among resting and any muscle interventions. the inhibition of the baroreflex bradycardia during spontaneous contraction was seen after beta-adrenergic blockade but abolished by muscarinic blockade, suggesting that the bradycardia is mainly evoked through cardiac vagal outflow. we conclude that central command, produced within the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem, selectively inhibits the cardiac component, but not the vasomotor component, of the aortic baroreflex at the onset of spontaneous exercise.
@background dietary intake and eating patterns of elderly people in israel: who is at nutritional risk? objectives the aim of this study was to describe dietary intake and identify predictors of energy and protein intake in a group of high-risk elderly people.   methods all elderly persons receiving publicly financed home care services in the area of sherbrooke, quebec, canada, were eligible. subjects (n = 145) 60 to 94 years of age from three home care programs were interviewed to measure sociodemographic, health, and food-related behavior variables. three nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls were used to describe usual dietary intake. independent predictors of energy and protein intake were derived from multiple regression analyses.   results very low mean energy intakes were observed in this functionally dependent population. more than 50% of the study subjects did not meet the recommended levels of daily protein intake (0.8 g/kg body weight). significant independent determinants of intake were burden of disease, stress, poor appetite, and vision.   conclusions results suggest that community-living elderly people with loss of autonomy may have more nutritional problems than healthy elderly individuals. surveillance of predictors of dietary intake may enable early detection and prevention of nutritional deficits.

@method short interval between two pap smears: effect on the result of the second smear? a prospective randomized trial meta-analysis involves combining summary information from related but independent studies. the objectives of a meta-analysis include increasing power to detect an overall treatment effect, estimation of the degree of benefit associated with a particular study treatment, assessment of the amount of variability between studies, or identification of study characteristics associated with particularly effective treatments. this article presents a tutorial on meta-analysis intended for anyone with a mathematical statistics background. search strategies and review methods of the literature are discussed. emphasis is focused on analytic methods for estimation of the parameters of interest. three modes of inference are discussed: maximum likelihood; restricted maximum likelihood, and bayesian. finally, software for performing inference using restricted maximum likelihood and fully bayesian methods are demonstrated. methods are illustrated using two examples: an evaluation of mortality from prophylactic use of lidocaine after a heart attack, and a comparison of length of hospital stay for stroke patients under two different management protocols.
@method an enhanced entity-attribute-value data model for representing high dimensional and sparse healthcare data abstract objective to determine the effects of a policy of “use acupuncture” on headache, health status, days off sick, and use of resources in patients with chronic headache compared with a policy of “avoid acupuncture.” design randomised, controlled trial. setting general practices in england and wales. participants 401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine. interventions patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months or to a control intervention offering usual care. main outcome measures headache score, sf-36 health status, and use of medication were assessed at baseline, three, and 12 months. use of resources was assessed every three months. results headache score at 12 months, the primary end point, was lower in the acupuncture group (16.2, sd 13.7, n = 161, 34% reduction from baseline) than in controls (22.3, sd 17.0, n = 140, 16% reduction from baseline). the adjusted difference between means is 4.6 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 7.0; p = 0.0002). this result is robust to sensitivity analysis incorporating imputation for missing data. patients in the acupuncture group experienced the equivalent of 22 fewer days of headache per year (8 to 38). sf-36 data favoured acupuncture, although differences reached significance only for physical role functioning, energy, and change in health. compared with controls, patients randomised to acupuncture used 15% less medication (p = 0.02), made 25% fewer visits to general practitioners (p = 0.10), and took 15% fewer days off sick (p = 0.2). conclusions acupuncture leads to persisting, clinically relevant benefits for primary care patients with chronic headache, particularly migraine. expansion of nhs acupuncture services should be considered.
@background a molecular evolution approach to study the roles of tropomyosin in fission yeast background: the regulation of the conformational dynamics of cellular actin structures is poorly understood. results: myosin and tropomyosin stabilize the conformation of formin-nucleated flexible actin filaments. conclusion: actin-binding proteins can play a central role in the establishment of the conformational properties of actin filaments. significance: our results add to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the conformational and functional versatility of the actin cytoskeleton. the conformational elasticity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for its versatile biological functions. increasing evidence supports that the interplay between the structural and functional properties of actin filaments is finely regulated by actin-binding proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences are not completely understood. previous studies showed that the binding of formins to the barbed end induces conformational transitions in actin filaments by making them more flexible through long range allosteric interactions. these conformational changes are accompanied by altered functional properties of the filaments. to get insight into the conformational regulation of formin-nucleated actin structures, in the present work we investigated in detail how binding partners of formin-generated actin structures, myosin and tropomyosin, affect the conformation of the formin-nucleated actin filaments using fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. time-dependent fluorescence anisotropy and temperature-dependent förster-type resonance energy transfer measurements revealed that heavy meromyosin, similarly to tropomyosin, restores the formin-induced effects and stabilizes the conformation of actin filaments. the stabilizing effect of heavy meromyosin is cooperative. the kinetic analysis revealed that despite the qualitatively similar effects of heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin on the conformational dynamics of actin filaments the mechanisms of the conformational transition are different for the two proteins. heavy meromyosin stabilizes the formin-nucleated actin filaments in an apparently single step reaction upon binding, whereas the stabilization by tropomyosin occurs after complex formation. these observations support the idea that actin-binding proteins are key elements of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the conformational and functional diversity of actin filaments in living cells.
@background clinical impact of malnutrition on complication rate and length of stay in elective ent patients: a prospective cohort study background/objectives:invasive procedures such as surgery cause immunosuppression, leading to increased risk of complications, infections and extended hospital stay. emerging research around immune-enhancing nutrition supplements and their ability to reduce postoperative complications and reduce treatment costs is promising. this randomised controlled trial aims to examine the effect of preoperative immunonutrition supplementation on length of hospital stay (los), complications and treatment costs in both well-nourished and malnourished gastrointestinal surgery patients.subjects/methods:ninety-five patients undergoing elective upper and lower gastrointestinal surgery were recruited. the treatment group (n=46) received a commercial immuno-enhancing supplement 5 days preoperatively. the control group (n=49) received no supplements. the primary outcome measure was los, and secondary outcome measures included complications and cost.results:a nonsignificant trend towards a shorter los within the treatment group was observed (7.1±4.1 compared with 8.8±6.5 days; p=0.11). for malnourished patients, this trend was greater with hospital stay reduced by 4 days (8.3±3.5 vs 12.3±9.5 days; p=0.21). complications and unplanned intensive care admission rates were very low in both the groups. the average admission cost was reduced by aud1576 in the treatment group compared with the control group (p=0.37).conclusions:preoperative immunonutrition therapy in gastrointestinal surgery has the potential to reduce the los and cost, with greater treatment benefit seen in malnourished patients; however, there is a need for additional research with greater patient numbers.
@method negative effect of chronic cadmium exposure on growth, histology, ultrastructure, antioxidant and innate immune responses in the liver of zebrafish: preventive role of blue light emitting diodes. cadmium (cd) is an environmental contaminant that poses serious risks to aquatic organisms and their associated ecosystem. the mechanisms underlying cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish remain largely unknown. in this study, adult female zebrafish were exposed to 0 (control), 1mgl-1 cd for 24h and 96h, and the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by cd were evaluated in the brain, liver and ovary. reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no), and malondialdehyde (mda) increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with cd in the brain and liver. the increase may result from the disturbance of genes including copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (cu/zn-sod), catalase (cat), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), and ciclooxigenase-2 (cox-2) at mrna, protein and activity levels. although ros, no and mda were not significantly affected by cd in the ovary, the up-regulation of cu/zn-sod, cat, inos, and cox-2 was observed. exposure to cd induced a sharp increase in the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) in the brain, liver and ovary, possibly contributing to activate inflammatory responses. furthermore, we also found a dramatic increase in mrna levels of nf-e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor κb (nf-κb) at 24h in the liver and ovary. the corresponding changes in the mrna levels of kelch-like-ech-associated protein 1 (keap1a and keap1b) and the inhibitor of κbα (iκbαa and iκbαb) may contribute to regulate the transcriptional activity of nrf2 and nf-κb, respectively. contrarily, mrna levels of nrf2, nf-κb, keap1, keap1b, iκbαa and iκbαb remained stable at 24 and 96h in the brain. taken together, we demonstrated cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish, possibly through transcriptional regulation of nrf2 and nf-κb and gene modifications at transcriptional, translational, post-translational levels, which would greatly extend our understanding on the cd toxicity.
@result bdnf overexpression in mouse hippocampal astrocytes promotes local neurogenesis and elicits anxiolytic-like activities preclinical data support the view that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and serotonergic systems regulate circuits involved in affective disorders. the present study examined neurochemical and behavioural consequences of an acute intrahippocampal injection of bdnf combined with an antidepressant by using in-vivo intracerebral microdialysis in the ventral hippocampus (vhi) in conscious mice and behavioural paradigms predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects [the mouse forced swim test (fst), the open-field (of) paradigm and the elevated plus maze (epm)]. neurochemical data revealed that bdnf (100 ng) potentiated the effects of the systemic administration of a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (ssri; paroxetine 4 mg/kg i.p.) and that of a locally applied citalopram perfusion on dialysate 5-ht levels in the vhi. these neurochemical changes correlated with behavioural data since, in the fst, antidepressant-like activity of paroxetine as measured on swimming behaviour was potentiated by bdnf. these data suggest an interesting synergy between bdnf and ssri on antidepressant-like activity. furthermore, in both the of and epm paradigms bdnf induced an anxiogenic-like activity, whereas paroxetine prevented this effect. finally, the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf on the serotonergic system might occur at both pre- and post-synaptic levels since by using in-situ hybridization, we showed that trkb-r mrna was expressed in the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus in adult mice. taken together the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf suggest that these behavioural changes were mediated by increases in 5-ht neurotransmission in vhi. thus a bdnf+ssri combination may offer new alternatives to treat mood disorders.
@background novel antiplatelet agents in the prevention of cardiovascular complications – focus on ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel decreases the rate of stent thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). however, despite intensified antiplatelet treatment, up to 4.7% of the patients undergoing coronary stenting develop thrombotic stent occlusion, suggesting incomplete platelet inhibition due to clopidogrel resistance. we evaluated the percentage of clopidogrel non-responders among 105 patients with coronary artery disease (cad) undergoing elective pci. all patients were treated regularly with aspirin 100 mg/d and received a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d before pci. clopidogrel non-responders were defined by an inhibition of adp (5 and 20 mol/l) induced platelet aggregation that was less than 10% when compared to baseline values 4 h after clopidogrel intake. semi-responders were identified by an inhibition of 10 to 29%. patients with an inhibition over 30% were regarded as responders. we found that 5 (adp 5 mol/l) to 11% (adp 20 mol/l) of the patients were non-responders and 9 to 26% were semi-responders. among the group of non-responders there were two incidents of subacute stent thrombosis after pci. we conclude that a subgroup of patients undergoing pci does not adequately respond to clopidogrel, which may correspond to the occurrence of thromboischemic complications. point-of-care testing may help to identify these patients who may then benefit from an alternative antiplatelet therapy.
@background transcription factor organic cation transporter 1 (oct-1) affects the expression of porcine klotho (kl) gene klotho is a multifunctional protein involved in numerous biological functions, ranging from mineral ion metabolism to signaling activities. recent studies have identified klotho as a target gene for peroxi‐some proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ), a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and an adipo‐genesis‐promoting factor. in a similar line of observation, eliminating klotho function from mice resulted in the generation of lean mice with almost no detectable fat tissue. in contrast to the klotho‐knockout mice (11.7±0.3 g at 9 wk), leptin‐deficient (ob/ob) mice are severely obese (49.3±0.6 g at 9 wk), due to excessive fat accumulation. to study the in vivo role of klotho in obesity, we have generated and characterized ob/ob mice lacking klotho activity [ob/ob‐klotho double‐knockout (dko) mice]. the ob/ob mice started to get bigger from 3 wk onward and gained almost 2 times more weight than their wild‐type (wt) counterparts (wt vs. ob/ob: 34.8±1.3 vs. 65.5±1.2 g at 21 wk). the generated ob/ob‐klotho dko mice were not only viable throughout their adulthood but also showed markedly reduced fat tissue accumulation compared to their ob/ob littermates. the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice had significantly (p<0.01) less retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and epididymal fat accumulation, compared to their ob/ob counterparts. similarly, the fatty liver that was consistently observed in the ob/ob mice was eliminated in the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice. such structural improvement in the liver was also evident from markedly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in ob/ob‐klotho dko mice, compared to their ob/ob counterparts (ob/ob vs. ob/ob‐klotho dko: 266 ± 36 vs. 65 ±2 mg/dl). finally, to study whether the absence of klotho can induce resistance to high‐fat‐diet‐induced obesity, we provided a high‐fat (60%) diet to klotho‐knockout mice and compared them with normal‐fat (20%) diet‐fed klotho‐knockout mice. no significant difference in body weight was detected in klotho‐knockout mice fed either the normal‐fat diet or high‐fat diet, while wt mice fed the high‐fat diet gradually gained body weight, compared to the normal‐fat‐diet‐fed counterparts. the results of our dietary and genetic manipulation studies provide in vivo evidence for a role of klotho in obesity and offer a novel target to manipulate obesity and associated complications.—ohnishi, m., kato, s., akiyoshi, j., atfi, a., razzaque, m. s., dietary and genetic evidence for enhancing glucose metabolism and reducing obesity by inhibiting klotho functions. faseb j. 25, 2031–2039 (2011). www.fasebj.org
@method ets-2 repressor factor recruits histone deacetylase to silence human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene expression in non-permissive cells. the 86k immediate early (ie) 2 protein of human cytomegalovirus trans-activates a number of homologous and heterologous promoters, including the cellular promoter for the 70k heat-shock protein (hsp70), and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. we have previously shown that ie2 trans-activates these two promoters in a tata-dependent manner, and that ie2 is able to form a direct contact with tata-box binding protein (tbp) in vitro. we now show that ie2 binds to the basic repeat region of tbp. in addition ie2 can contact a second general transcription factor, tfiib. we have mapped the tbp- and tfiib-binding regions within ie2 and show that these regions overlap, and also lie within parts of the protein previously identified as being required for the trans-activation and autoregulation functions of ie2.
@result clinical field-strength mri of amyloid plaques induced by low-level cholesterol feeding in rabbits beta-amyloid and alz-50 immunocytochemical reactivity were determined in the brains of rabbits fed either a control or 2% cholesterol diet. control rabbits demonstrated no accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid within 3 min after death. in animals fed the experimental diet for 4, 6, and 8 weeks (postmortem interval < 3 min), there was an increasingly mild-to-moderate-to-severe accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid. whether or not beta-amyloid is causally linked to processes leading to dementia, it is related in some way to the prime cause of human death; heart disease. hypercholesterolemic rabbits may provide an animal model to study altered beta-app metabolism leading to alzheimer-like beta-amyloid accumulation xe03and extracellular deposition in brain.
@result rosaceae conserved orthologous sequences marker polymorphism in sweet cherry germplasm and construction of a snp-based map backgrounddomestication and breeding involve the selection of particular phenotypes, limiting the genomic diversity of the population and creating a bottleneck. these effects can be precisely estimated when the location of domestication is established. few analyses have focused on understanding the genetic consequences of domestication and breeding in fruit trees. in this study, we aimed to analyse genetic structure and changes in the diversity in sweet cherry prunus avium l.resultsthree subgroups were detected in sweet cherry, with one group of landraces genetically very close to the analysed wild cherry population. a limited number of ssr markers displayed deviations from the frequencies expected under neutrality. after the removal of these markers from the analysis, a very limited bottleneck was detected between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces, with a much more pronounced bottleneck between sweet cherry landraces and modern sweet cherry varieties. the loss of diversity between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces at the s-locus was more significant than that for microsatellites. particularly high levels of differentiation were observed for some s-alleles.conclusionsseveral domestication events may have happened in sweet cherry or/and intense gene flow from local wild cherry was probably maintained along the evolutionary history of the species. a marked bottleneck due to breeding was detected, with all markers, in the modern sweet cherry gene pool. the microsatellites did not detect the bottleneck due to domestication in the analysed sample. the vegetative propagation specific to some fruit trees may account for the differences in diversity observed at the s-locus. our study provides insights into domestication events of cherry, however, requires confirmation on a larger sampling scheme for both sweet cherry landraces and wild cherry.
@background pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptides and α-amidation in olfactory neurogenesis and neuronal survival in vitro posttranslational processing of peptide precursors frequently includes cooh-terminal amidation by the bifunctional enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (pam). we examined the ontogeny of pam gene expression using in situ hybridization and detected expression in the cardiogenic region beginning at embryonic day 9 (e9) and in decidualizing uterine endometrium and myometrial smooth muscle at even earlier postimplantation stages. pam expression in the cns at e10 was highest in the dorsal spinal cord and floor plate and exhibited complex patterning in several cns regions, including the ventricular zone, over the next several days with pam expression first detected in neurons at e13. high levels of pam expression characterized several nonneural cell populations as well, including limb mesoderm and the mesenchyme immediately adjacent to nasal, maxillary, palatal, and dental epithelia during tissue fusion and remodeling. since alternative splicing generates pam transcripts encoding proproteins that are differentially localized and processed, we used probes that distinguish major subsets of pam transcripts to determine that transcripts encoding integral membrane pam isoforms predominate in most, if not all, pam-expressing cell types throughout development. further, transcripts that encode soluble and cleavable pam isoforms are essentially absent from two cns areas that are rich in transcripts encoding integral membrane, bifunctional pam: the ependymal region of the spinal cord and the ventricular zone of the hippocampus. these results provide evidence for widespread expression and cell-type-specific alternative splicing of pam during development and raise the possibility that region-specific amidation of pam substrates contributes significantly to several developmental processes.
@result a unified approach for taxonomy-based technology forecasting renewable energy (re) technologies are increasingly viewed as critically important since the noticeable depletion of fossil fuel. knowledge that facilitates forecasting the likely growth and consequences of emergent technologies is essential for well-informed technology management. acquiring and analyzing such knowledge is hampered by the amount of data available in publications. in order to elucidate the advance of technologies, we want to address questions like: “how many scientific articles have been published in solar energy recently?” intelligent search techniques capable of grouping semantically similar concepts are therefore needed, such that e.g. the term ”parabolic trough” is subsumed under solar energy related technologies and hence articles about it should be included in the analysis. the novelty of this work is the deployment of a large, high quality re-taxonomy for comprehensive trend discovery in publications and patents. we report interesting trends of renewables in two case studies: power generation and desalination techniques. while all major renewables — except geothermal-recently boomed in power generation in terms of publication volume, leading to a nearly equibalanced diversification, patents only reflect strong growth for wind and solar. renewables in desalination, in particular reverse osmosis, are mainly solar and wind with a slight upward trend of biofuels in publications, hereas other renewables are still in experimental stage.
@background knowledge transfer and exchange context this article presents the main results from a large-scale analytical systematic review on knowledge exchange interventions at the organizational and policymaking levels. the review integrated two broad traditions, one roughly focused on the use of social science research results and the other focused on policymaking and lobbying processes.   methods data collection was done using systematic snowball sampling. first, we used prospective snowballing to identify all documents citing any of a set of thirty-three seminal papers. this process identified 4,102 documents, 102 of which were retained for in-depth analysis. the bibliographies of these 102 documents were merged and used to identify retrospectively all articles cited five times or more and all books cited seven times or more. all together, 205 documents were analyzed. to develop an integrated model, the data were synthesized using an analytical approach.   findings this article developed integrated conceptualizations of the forms of collective knowledge exchange systems, the nature of the knowledge exchanged, and the definition of collective-level use. this literature synthesis is organized around three dimensions of context: level of polarization (politics), cost-sharing equilibrium (economics), and institutionalized structures of communication (social structuring).   conclusions the model developed here suggests that research is unlikely to provide context-independent evidence for the intrinsic efficacy of knowledge exchange strategies. to design a knowledge exchange intervention to maximize knowledge use, a detailed analysis of the context could use the kind of framework developed here.
@method life-long endurance running is associated with reduced glycation and mechanical stress in connective tissue the present study examined the hypothesis that collagen fibril diameter and crimp angle in ruptured human achilles tendons differed from that of intact ones. tissue samples were obtained from the central core (distal core) and the posterior periphery (distal superficial) at the rupture site, and the proximally intact (proximal superficial) part of the tendon in 10 subjects (38+/-8 years) with a complete tendon rupture. for comparisons corresponding tissue samples were procured from age (38+/-7 years) and gender matched intact achilles tendons during routine forensic autopsy. the cross-sectional area density and diameter distribution of fibrils were analyzed using stereological techniques of digitized electron microscopy biopsy cross-sections, while crimp angle was measured by the changing banding pattern of collagen fibers when rotated between crossed polars. nine of 10 persons with tendon ruptures reported that the injury did not occur during exceedingly large forces, and none experienced any symptoms in the days or months prior to the injury. fibril diameter distribution showed no region-specific differences in either the ruptured or intact tendons for either group. however, in the distal core there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in 60-150 nm range, p<0.01. similarly, in the distal superficial portion there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in the 90-120 nm range, 2p<0.05, while there were no differences in the proximal superficial tendons. crimp angle did not display any region-specific differences, or any difference between the rupture and intact tendons. in conclusion, these data suggest that although crimp morphology is unchanged there appears to be a site-specific loss of larger fibrils in the core and periphery of the achilles tendon rupture site. moreover, the lack of symptoms prior to the rupture suggests that clinical tendinopathy is not an etiological factor in complete tendon ruptures.
@background on-scene treatment of spinal injuries in motor sports background spinal immobilisation during extrication of patients in road traffic collisions is routinely used despite the lack of evidence for this practice. in a previous proof of concept study (n=1), we recorded up to four times more cervical spine movement during extrication using conventional techniques than self-controlled extrication. objective the objective of this study was to establish, using biomechanical analysis which technique provides the minimal deviation of the cervical spine from the neutral in-line position during extrication from a vehicle in a larger sample of variable age, height and mass. methods a crew of two paramedics and four fire-fighters extricated 16 immobilised participants from a vehicle using six techniques for each participant. participants were marked with biomechanical sensors and relative movement between the sensors was captured via high-speed infrared motion analysis cameras. a three-dimensional mathematical model was developed and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare movement across extrication techniques. results controlled self-extrication without a collar resulted in a mean movement of 13.33° from the neutral in-line position of the cervical spine compared to a mean movement of 18.84° during one of the equipment-aided extrications. two equipment-aided techniques had significantly higher movement (p<0.05) than other techniques. both height (p=0.003) and mass (p=0.02) of the participants were significant independent predictors of movement. conclusions these data support the findings of the proof of concept study, for haemodynamically stable patients controlled self-extrication causes less movement of the cervical spine than extrications performed using traditional prehospital rescue equipment.
@background modelling off-the-shelf information systems requirements: an ontological approach abstract. information systems analysis and design (isad) methodologies provide facilities for describing existing or conceived real‐world systems. these facilities are ontologically expressive if they are capable of describing all real‐world phenomena completely and clearly. in this paper we formally examine the notion of the ontological expressiveness of a grammar and discuss some of its implications for the design and use of isad methodologies. we identify some generic ways in which ontological expressiveness may be undermined in a grammar and some potential consequences of these violations. we also examine ontological expressiveness within the context of some other desirable features that might be considered in the design of isad methodologies.
@method on the cost of database clusters reconfiguration many cluster based replication solutions have been proposed providing scalability and fault-tolerance. many of these solutions perform replica control in a middleware on top of the database replicas. in such a setting concurrency control is a challenge and is often performed on a table basis. additionally, some systems put severe requirements on transaction programs (e.g., to declare all objects to be accessed in advance). this paper addresses these issues and presents a middleware-based replication scheme which provides the popular snapshot isolation level at the same tuple-level granularity as database systems like postgresql and oracle, without any need to declare transaction properties in advance. both read-only and update transactions can be executed at any replica while providing data consistency at all times. our approach provides what we call "1-copy-snapshot-isolation" as long as the underlying database replicas provide snapshot isolation. we have implemented our approach as a replicated middleware on top of postgresql replicas. by providing a standard jdbc interface, the middleware is completely transparent to the client program. fault-tolerance is provided by automatically reconnecting clients in case of crashes. our middleware shows good performance in terms of response times and scalability.
@background variations in internal structure, composition and protein distribution between intra‐ and extra‐articular knee ligaments and tendons the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) is a band of dense connective tissue which courses from the femur to the tibia. the acl is a key structure in the knee joint, as it resists anterior tibial translation and rotational loads. when the knee is extended, the acl has a mean length of 32 mm and a width of 7–12 mm. there are two components of the acl, the anteromedial bundle (amb) and the posterolateral bundle (plb). they are not isometric with the main change being lengthening of the amb and shortening of the plb during flexion. the acl has a microstructure of collagen bundles of multiple types (mostly type i) and a matrix made of a network of proteins, glycoproteins, elastic systems, and glycosaminoglycans with multiple functional interactions. the complex ultrastructural organization and abundant elastic system of the acl allow it to withstand multiaxial stresses and varying tensile strains. the acl is innervated by posterior articular branches of the tibial nerve and is vascularized by branches of the middle genicular artery.
@method manual therapy treatment of cervicogenic dizziness: a systematic review. background although low back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for the treatment of low back pain.   objectives the objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low back pain.   search strategy we searched the cochrane complementary medicine field trials register, the cochrane controlled trials register (1997, issue 1), medline (1966 - 1996), embase (1988 - 1996), science citation index and reference lists of articles.   selection criteria randomised trials of all types of acupuncture treatment that involves needling for subjects with non-specific low back pain.   data collection and analysis two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.   main results eleven trials were included. the methodological quality was low. only two trials were of high quality. three trials compared acupuncture to no treatment, which were of low methodological quality and provide conflicting evidence. there was moderate evidence from two trials that acupuncture is not more effective than trigger point injection or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). there was limited evidence from eight trials that acupuncture is not more effective than placebo or sham acupuncture for the treatment of chronic low back pain.   reviewer's conclusions the evidence summarised in this systematic review does not indicate that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of back pain.
@method theoretical consideration of the effect of drug holidays on bmd and tissue age context the optimal duration of treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis is uncertain.   objective to compare the effects of discontinuing alendronate treatment after 5 years vs continuing for 10 years.   design and setting randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 10 us clinical centers that participated in the fracture intervention trial (fit).   participants one thousand ninety-nine postmenopausal women who had been randomized to alendronate in fit, with a mean of 5 years of prior alendronate treatment.   intervention randomization to alendronate, 5 mg/d (n = 329) or 10 mg/d (n = 333), or placebo (n = 437) for 5 years (1998-2003).   main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was total hip bone mineral density (bmd); secondary measures were bmd at other sites and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. an exploratory outcome measure was fracture incidence.   results compared with continuing alendronate, switching to placebo for 5 years resulted in declines in bmd at the total hip (-2.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.9% to -1.8%; p<.001) and spine (-3.7%; 95% ci, -4.5% to -3.0%; p<.001), but mean levels remained at or above pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. similarly, those discontinuing alendronate had increased serum markers of bone turnover compared with continuing alendronate: 55.6% (p<.001) for c-telopeptide of type 1 collagen, 59.5% (p < .001) for serum n = propeptide of type 1 collagen, and 28.1% (p<.001) for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, but after 5 years without therapy, bone marker levels remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. after 5 years, the cumulative risk of nonvertebral fractures (rr, 1.00; 95% ci, 0.76-1.32) was not significantly different between those continuing (19%) and discontinuing (18.9%) alendronate. among those who continued, there was a significantly lower risk of clinically recognized vertebral fractures (5.3% for placebo and 2.4% for alendronate; rr, 0.45; 95% ci, 0.24-0.85) but no significant reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures (11.3% for placebo and 9.8% for alendronate; rr, 0.86; 95% ci, 0.60-1.22). a small sample of 18 transilial bone biopsies did not show any qualitative abnormalities, with bone turnover (double labeling) seen in all specimens.   conclusions women who discontinued alendronate after 5 years showed a moderate decline in bmd and a gradual rise in biochemical markers but no higher fracture risk other than for clinical vertebral fractures compared with those who continued alendronate. these results suggest that for many women, discontinuation of alendronate for up to 5 years does not appear to significantly increase fracture risk. however, women at very high risk of clinical vertebral fractures may benefit by continuing beyond 5 years.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct 00398931.
@method view-based consistency and its implementation shared memory facilitates the transition from sequential to parallel processing. since most data structures can be retained, simply adding synchronization achieves correct, efficient programs for many applications. we discuss our experience with parallel computing on networks of workstations using the treadmarks distributed shared memory system. dsm allows processes to assume a globally shared virtual memory even though they execute on nodes that do not physically share memory. we illustrate a dsm system consisting of n networked workstations, each with its own memory. the dsm software provides the abstraction of a globally shared memory, in which each processor can access any data item without the programmer having to worry about where the data is or how to obtain its value.
@method chronic administration of cholesterol oximes in mice increases transcription of cytoprotective genes and improves transcriptome alterations induced by alpha-synuclein overexpression in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons microarray-based assays have significantly expanded their scope and range of applications over the last 10 years, and--at least for gene expression--can be considered mainstream applications. high-throughput, microarray-based gene expression studies have proven particularly useful in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, for which they have provided key insights in understanding disease pathogenesis, regional and cellular specificity, and identification of therapeutic targets. even though many experimental steps are currently performed in specialized core facilities, the key steps of a microarray study--experimental design, and data analysis and interpretation--are performed by the primary investigator. knowledge of the issues related to these key steps is essential to properly perform and interpret a microarray experiment and constitutes the main focus of the present chapter. the basic analytical steps are covered, and annotated r code for the analysis of a published dataset is provided.
@result involvement of major components from sporothrix schenckii cell wall in the caspase-1 activation, nitric oxide and cytokines production during experimental sporotrichosis production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) by adherent peritoneal cells from balb/c mice was measured at week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after intravenous inoculation with 10(6) sporothrix schenckii yeasts. as compared with age-matched controls, il-1 and tnf production by adherent peritoneal cells from s. schenckii-infected mice was reduced severely at week 4 and 6 of infection and greater than normal at week 8 and 10. moreover, between week 4 and 6 of infection there was a depression of delayed type hypersensitivity response to a specific whole soluble antigen, and an increase in fungal multiplication in the livers and spleens of infected mice. thus, the deficits of cell-mediated immunity in mice with systemic s. schenckii infection may derive, in part, from impaired amplification of the immune response consequent to abnormal generation of il-1 and tnf.
@background particle impact on metal substrates with application to foreign object damage to aircraft engines the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
@background impact of intestinal permeability, inflammation status and parasitic infections on infant growth faltering in rural bangladesh. human milk was shown to inhibit adherence of giardia at concentrations as low as 0.5%. unsaturated fatty acids were also found to cause significant inhibitory effects on adherence, with ed50 values less than 1 microm for arachidonic, linoleic and palmitic acids. a variety of infant feeding formulae derived from cow's milk and soy bean had suppressive effects on adherence. these observations may explain in part the low prevalence of giardiasis in young infants.
@result microrna408 is critical for the hy5-spl7 gene network that mediates the coordinated response to light and copper[c][w] the binding of the sbp domain of crr1 to copper response elements of target promoters in vitro is blocked by cu(ii) or hg(ii), which also deactivate transcription in vivo. mutagenesis of the sbp domain implicates a conserved his residue in interaction with copper ions, suggesting a mechanism for copper sensing. a metallothionein-like domain at the crr1 c terminus is implicated in zinc homeostasis. copper response regulator 1 (crr1), an sbp-domain transcription factor, is a global regulator of nutritional copper signaling in chlamydomonas reinhardtii and activates genes necessary during periods of copper deficiency. we localized chlamydomonas crr1 to the nucleus in mustard (sinapis alba) seedlings, a location consistent with its function as a transcription factor. the zn binding sbp domain of crr1 binds copper ions in vitro. cu(i) can replace zn(ii), but the cu(ii) form is unstable. the dna binding activity is inhibited in vitro by cu(ii) or hg(ii) ions, which also prevent activation of transcription in vivo, but not by co(ii) or ni(ii), which have no effect in vivo. copper inhibition of dna binding is reduced by mutation of a conserved his residue. these results implicate the sbp domain in copper sensing. deletion of a c-terminal metallothionein-like cys-rich domain impacted neither nutritional copper signaling nor the effect of mercuric supplementation, but rendered crr1 insensitive to hypoxia and to nickel supplementation, which normally activate the copper deficiency regulon in wild-type cells. strains carrying the crr1-δcys allele upregulate zrt genes and hyperaccumulate zn(ii), suggesting that the effect of nickel ions may be revealing a role for the c-terminal domain of crr1 in zinc homeostasis in chlamydomonas.
@result the small-subunit rrna gene sequences of venerids and the phylogeny of bivalvia in the july (1996) issue of journal of molecular evolution, steiner and mu ̈ller (1996) discuss the limitations of 18s rdna sequences to achieve a ‘‘reasonable’’ phylogeny of bivalve mollusks. after a nice introduction to the subject and thorough references to molecular techniques applied to bivalvia, they collect 21 18s rdna sequences published to date—2 polyplacophora, 3 gastropoda, and 16 bivalvia belonging to the filibranchia (4pteriomorphia) and eulamelibranchia ( 4heterodonta)—plus 2 new sequences (both also filibranchia). eight of these sequences, however, were excluded from the main analyses. two more partial sequences were not included: one cephalopoda and one polyplacophora (wheeler et al. 1993). different tree-constructing algorithms, based on parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood, as well as other methods, to test the reliability of the clades, such as the prn and spectral analysis were used. the results obtained led them to propose a ‘‘preferred tree (their fig. 9) combining the results from the 18s rdna data and morphological characters compiled by waller (1978, 1990).’’ in their words, this tree ‘‘is not a computer-constructed tree but an evaluation of hypotheses on bivalve phylogeny from the given morphological and molecular trees.’’ moreover ‘‘the failure of neighbor-joining and parsimony to resolve this clade [bivalvia]’’ is probably due to the different substitution rates among species. we have reanalyzed the data set presented by steiner and müller (1996), to which we added 12 more molluscan sequences available via genbank. sequence alignments were generated using clustalw (thompson et al. 1996), with subsequent manual correction based on secondary structure constraints. two alignments were analyzed, one with the whole data set and another in which four ambiguous-alignment zones corresponding to loops were removed. alignments are available at the ftp site porthos.bio.ub.es/users/ftp/pub/teu/18sphylogeny. parsimony analyses were performed with paup 3.1.1 (swofford 1993). analyses were run for both alignments, using unweighted and weighted parsimony at different transition/transversion rates (3 and 5), as well as using transversion parsimony (transitions downweighted to 0). gaps were treated in two ways, as missing data or as a fifth state. three independent data sets were analyzed: the 13 taxa analyzed in the original paper (data set 1), the 21 taxa reported in their table 2 (data set 2), and all molluscan sequences published to date (data set 3). all the analyses run with data sets 2 and 3 rendered bivalvia monophyletic (figs. 1b and c) with an internal unstable topology, varying depending on the analysis condition. the following clades above family level are always monophyletic: pectinidae, arca+ pectinidae, ostreidae, mytilidae, mactridae, and the two represented eulamelibranchia groups ( mya + mactridae). the paraphyletic bivalvia have only been recovered in some cases when data set 1 was used for the analyses (fig. 1a). although the internal topology differs slightly from their fig. 4, the two gastropoda also cluster with the two mactridae, which are the longest branches of the tree. these results clearly indicate that the paraphyletic bivalvia is an artifact, most likely due to the low number of taxa used in the analyses, combined with the long branch attraction effect among the gastropoda and the mactridae. simulations have demonstrated that adding large numbers of additional taxa to phylogenetic analyses may increase the accuracy of the estimated trees, reduce the long branch attraction effect, and, at the same time, reduce the need for computationally complex methods of analysis (hillis 1996). in our case, solely increasing the umber of taxa from 13 to 21 is enough to obtain a robust monophyletic bivalvia clade. from these results we suggest that computational efforts in phylogenetic analysis should focus on analyzing the biggest available data sets instead of performing more costly computational methods (e.g., the prn and spectral analyses) with fewer taxa. the failure of recovering a reliable internal phylogeny j mol evol (1999) 48:256–261
@method exploring the role of drug-metabolising enzymes in antidepressant side effects the construction of a depression rating scale designed to be particularly sensitive to treatment effects is described. ratings of 54 english and 52 swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. the inner-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the hamilton rating scale (hrs), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the hrs, indicating greater sensitivity to change. the practical and ethical implications in terms of smaller sample sizes in clinical trials are discussed.
@result cellular traces of behavioral classical conditioning can be recorded at several specific sites in a simple nervous system in vitro appetitive classical conditioning of the feeding response in the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis. j. neurophysiol. 78: 2351-2362, 1997. an in vitro preparation was developed that allowed electrophysiological analysis of appetitive conditioning of feeding in the model molluscan system, lymnaea. the network generating the feeding motor program (fictive feeding) is well characterized at the cellular level and consists of identified central pattern generator (cpg) interneurons, motor neurons, and modulatory interneurons. activation of a modulatory interneuron, the slow oscillator (so), evokes the three-phase fictive feeding rhythm in the same semi-intact preparations where tactile stimuli can be applied to the lips. by pairing touch as a conditioned stimulus (cs) with stimulation of the so as an unconditioned stimulus (us), we established an effective in vitro paradigm for appetitive conditioning. before training, touch to the lips evoked only brief and weak activity in the feeding interneurons and motor neurons. after 6-10 conditioning trials, there was a significant enhancement in the fictive feeding response to cs alone. this was not seen in controls (cs only, us only, random cs and us) and in preparations where there was no initial brief response to touch before conditioning. direct recordings from the protraction phase n1m interneurons during in vitro conditioning indicated that the enhancement of the fictive feeding is due to an increased activation of these cpg cells by mechanosensory inputs from the lips. we also found that the conditioned response was not due to a facilitated activation of modulatory neurons in the feeding network, such as the so or the cerebral giant cells (cgcs), because the activity of these cells remained unchanged after conditioning.
@background in silico generation of alternative hypotheses using causal mapping (cmap) actomyosin-based cortical contractility is a common feature of eukaryotic cells but the capability to produce rhythmic contractions is found in only a few types such as cardiomyocytes. mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of this capability remain largely unknown. rhythmic contractility can be induced in non-muscle cells by microtubule depolymerization. spreading epithelial cells and fibroblasts in which microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole or colcemid underwent rhythmic oscillations of the body that lasted for several hours before the cells acquired a stable, flattened shape. by contrast, control cells spread and flattened into discoid shapes in a smooth and regular manner. quantitative analysis of the oscillations showed that they have a period of about 50 seconds. the kinase inhibitors, ha 1077 and h7, and the more specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y 27632, caused the oscillations to immediately cease and the cells to become flat. transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium preceded the contractile phase of the oscillations. wrinkle formation by cells plated on elastic substrata indicated that the contractility of colcemid-treated cells increased in comparison to controls but was drastically decreased after ha 1077 addition. these data suggest that an intact microtubular system normally prevents pulsations by moderating excessive rho-mediated actin myosin contractility. possible mechanistic interactions between rho-mediated and calcium activated contractile pathways that could produce morphological oscillations are discussed.
@background production of the versatile cellulase for cellulose bioconversion and cellulase inducer synthesis by genetic improvement of trichoderma reesei background: β-glucosidase completes cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis by releasing glucose from cellobiose. results: saxs experiments revealed that aspergillus niger β-glucosidase has a cellulase-like tadpole molecular shape, uncommon to enzymes that act on the soluble substrates. conclusion: we show that anbgl1 n- and c-terminal domains are linked by a long extended linker. significance: understanding anbgl1 architecture is useful for comprehension of the enzyme-cell wall interaction and the process of biomass saccharification. aspergillus niger is known to secrete large amounts of β-glucosidases, which have a variety of biotechnological and industrial applications. here, we purified an a. niger β-glucosidase (anbgl1) and conducted its biochemical and biophysical analyses. purified enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kda forms monomers in solution as judged by native gel electrophoresis and has a pi value of 4.55, as found for most of the fungi of β-glucosidases. surprisingly, the small angle x-ray experiments reveal that anbgl1 has a tadpole-like structure, with the n-terminal catalytic domain and c-terminal fibronectin iii-like domain (fniii) connected by the long linker peptide (∼100 amino acid residues) in an extended conformation. this molecular organization resembles the one adopted by other cellulases (such as cellobiohydrolases, for example) that frequently contain a catalytic domain linked to the cellulose-binding module that mediates their binding to insoluble and polymeric cellulose. the reasons why anbgl1, which acts on the small soluble substrates, has a tadpole molecular shape are not entirely clear. however, our enzyme pulldown assays with different polymeric substrates suggest that anbgl1 has little or no capacity to bind to and to adsorb cellulose, xylan, and starch, but it has high affinity to lignin. molecular dynamics simulations suggested that clusters of residues located in the c-terminal fniii domain interact strongly with lignin fragments. the simulations showed that numerous arginine residues scattered throughout the fniii surface play an important role in the interaction with lignin by means of cation-π stacking with the lignin aromatic rings. these results indicate that the c-terminal fniii domain could be operational for immobilization of the enzyme on the cell wall and for the prevention of unproductive binding of cellulase to the biomass lignin.
@background protective effect of zinc chloride against cobalt chloride-induced cytotoxicity on vero cells: preliminary results the effects of cocl(2) on retinoic acid (ra)-treated embryoid bodies (ebs) were investigated. four-day ebs were treated with 5x10(-6) m of ra for 4 d, then subjected to attached culturing for 7 d in the presence of cocl(2) at 0, 20, and 100 microm. differentiation into map2- and gfap-immunopositive cells was inhibited by cocl(2) in a dose-dependent manner. next, ra-treated ebs were dissociated into single cells and cultured for 7 d at an initial cell density of 1x10(3)/cm(2). the number of cells increased in a cocl(2)-dose dependent fashion. in cultures with 100 microm of cocl(2), more than 90% of the cells were immunopositive for nestin and nestin-immunopositive cells formed clusters, while there were few cells immunopositive for map2 or gfap. these results suggest that cocl(2) inhibits neural differentiation of ra-treated eb cells and promotes the proliferation of nestin-immunopositive cells, i.e., embryonic stem (es)-derived neural stem-like cells.
@method impact of opiate addiction on neuroinflammation in hiv the national neuroaids tissue consortium (nntc) was founded in 1998, in response to the scientific need for well‐characterized central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns) tissues and fluids from hiv‐infected individuals. in addition to performing the routine functions of non‐transplant anatomic tissue banks, the consortium offers a unique model for the integration of independent research entities in order to provide well‐characterized tissues and fluids for the international research community. herein, we describe the structure of the consortium, pointing out the inherent strengths of linking together multiple independent sites for the purpose of banking hiv‐infected nervous system tissues. we describe the neuropathology protocol that was adopted and successfully implemented at the four participating banks of the consortium.
@background estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha promotes malignancy and osteoblastic tumorigenesis in prostate cancer bone metastases are complications of multiple myeloma and solid tumors, including breast and prostate carcinomas. several reports have demonstrated that the preference to metastasize to bone by tumor cells is not a casual but an addressed event, which relies on specific interactions among tumor cells, bone marrow microenvironment and bone cells. one of the features that gives tumor cells more chances to survive and proliferate into the bone tissue is osteomimicry, that is the ability to acquire a bone cell phenotype, especially osteoblast-like. as clearly demonstrated, prostate and breast cancer cells try to resemble osteoblasts by expressing bone matrix proteins, the specific marker alkaline phosphatase, and molecules regulating the osteoblast/osteoclast cross-talk. based on this evidence it is crucial to dissect in more detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the osteomimetic properties of cancer cells and identify new therapeutic targets eventually leading to a better and prolonged life expectation for patients with bone.
@background templates for textual use cases of software product lines: results from a systematic mapping study and a controlled experiment the derivation of system test cases for product families is difficult due to variability in the requirements, since each variation point multiplies the number of possible behaviors to be tested. this paper proposes an approach to develop domain test cases from use cases that contain variabilities and to derive application test cases from them. the basic idea to avoid combinatorial explosion is to preserve the variability in domain test cases. new strategies to capture variability in test cases are suggested, which in combination help dealing with all basic types of variability in a use case and in its relationships (e.g., include >>).
@background token based scheduling of hvac services in commercial buildings this paper provides an overview of research related to use of building thermal mass for shifting and reducing peak cooling loads in commercial buildings. the paper presents background on the concept and the problem of optimizing zone temperature setpoints and provides specific results that have been obtained through simulations, controlled laboratory testing, and field studies. the studies have demonstrated significant savings potential for use of building thermal mass in commercial buildings. however, the savings are sensitive to many factors, including utility rates, type of equipment, occupancy schedule, building construction, climate conditions, and control strategy. the paper also attempts to provide an assessment of the state of the art in load control using building thermal mass and to identify the steps necessary to achieve widespread application of appropriate control strategies.
@method interaction of ethanol with inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger rna and protein: direct effects on autacoids and endotoxin in vivo. research over the past 5 years has demonstrated that immunologic activation of mouse macrophages induces the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which oxidizes a guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine, yielding citrulline and the reactive radical, nitric oxide. a review of the biochemistry and immunologic regulation of this pathway in macrophages provides a backdrop against which to evaluate its effector functions. reports published in the past 2 years suggest that synthesis of no mediates much of the antimicrobial activity of mouse macrophages against some fungal, helminthic, protozoal and bacterial pathogens.
@method in silico construction of a protein interaction landscape for nucleotide excision repair the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
@method association between fcgammar iia and iiia polymorphism and clinical manifestations in korean patients with adult-onset still's disease. stimulation of primary human monocytes from several donors by cross‐linking of fcγ receptor type i (fcγri) and fcγrii gave rise to calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. these early events were not observed without cross‐linking. cd45, a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, when co‐cross‐linked with either fcγri or fcγrii, could prevent fcγri and fcγrii‐mediated calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. when interleukin (il)‐6 production was measured, we noted a strong il‐6 production after activation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. in contrast to calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, il‐6 production was not affected by co‐cross‐linking of cd45 with either fcγri or fcγrii. interestingly, cross‐linking of the cd45 itself was sufficient to induce il‐6 production. our results show that the cd45 molecule is important in modulating early events following stimulation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. however, triggering of cd45 alone can also induce il‐6 production, indicating that cd45 ligation itself can give signals and may have an important role in cytokine induction pathways.
@background the clinical features of osteogenesis imperfecta in vietnam osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common of the inherited connective tissue disorders that primarily affect bone. however, it is a systemic disorder, as evidenced by the occurrence of ocular complications, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss, joint laxity, restrictive pulmonary disease, and short stature. the oi classification initially included four phenotypes (i–iv) involving col1a1 and col1a2 mutations. three new phenotypes have been added, of which one, type vii, is the result of mutations of the cartilage-associated protein (crtap) gene. investigation of recessive forms of oi particularly reported among south african blacks have revealed mutations involving both the crtap gene and the leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan 1 (lepre1) gene, each involved in collagen proline-3 hydroxylation. issues related to the treatment of oi with bisphosphonates involve patient selection, evaluation of the results of treatment, and the duration of treatment. also, questions exist regarding the difference in treatment response between children and adults with oi. other treatment options, such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34), rank ligand inhibitors, and stem cell technology, are being evaluated or are of future investigative interest.
@background hyperbinary expansions and stern polynomials we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
@background gene expression profile induced by ovariectomy in bone marrow of mice: a functional approach to identify new candidate genes associated to osteoporosis risk in women. estrogen deficiency caused by ovariectomy (ovx) results in a marked bone loss due to stimulated bone resorption by osteoclasts. during our investigations of the pathogenesis of bone loss in estrogen deficiency, we found that ovx selectively stimulates b-lymphopoiesis which results in marked accumulation of b220-positive pre-b cells in mouse bone marrow. to examine the possible correlation between stimulated b-lymphopoiesis and bone loss, 8-week-old female mice were treated with interleukin (il) 7, which stimulates b-lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. we also examined bone mass in il-7 receptor-knockout mice that exhibit marked suppression of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow. the increased b-lymphopoiesis induced by il-7 administration resulted in marked bone loss by stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with intact ovarian function. the changes in both b-lymphopoiesis and bone mass in il-7-treated female mice were similar to those in age-matched ovx mice. in contrast, the trabecular bone volume of the femur was greatly increased in both female and male il-7 receptor-knockout mice when compared with the respective wild-type and heterozygous littermates. these results show that the perturbation of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow is closely linked to the change in bone mass. we propose here that the increased b-lymphopoiesis due to estrogen deficiency is involved in the mechanism of stimulated bone resorption.
@method unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks to guide marker discovery in recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (cnns) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. comparatively, unsupervised learning with cnns has received less attention. in this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of cnns for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. we introduce a class of cnns called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (dcgans), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.
@result chromium supplement inhibits skeletal muscle atrophy in hindlimb-suspended mice. skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating response to fasting, disuse, cancer, and other systemic diseases. in atrophying muscles, the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 (mafbx), is dramatically induced, and this response is necessary for rapid atrophy. here, we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the pi3k/akt pathway decreases, leading to activation of foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction. igf-1 treatment or akt overexpression inhibits foxo and atrogin-1 expression. moreover, constitutively active foxo3 acts on the atrogin-1 promoter to cause atrogin-1 transcription and dramatic atrophy of myotubes and muscle fibers. when foxo activation is blocked by a dominant-negative construct in myotubes or by rnai in mouse muscles in vivo, atrogin-1 induction during starvation and atrophy of myotubes induced by glucocorticoids are prevented. thus, forkhead factor(s) play a critical role in the development of muscle atrophy, and inhibition of foxo factors is an attractive approach to combat muscle wasting.
@background cross-leg flaps: our preferred alternative to free flaps in the treatment of complex traumatic lower extremity wounds. background: microvascular free flap anastomoses performed for lower extremity reconstruction are traditionally proximal to the zone of injury. the authors assessed the feasibility and outcomes of microvascular free flaps with anastomoses performed distal to the zone of injury. methods: the authors retrospectively reviewed all microvascular free flaps performed at their institution over the past 10 years for lower extremity reconstruction and compared this group with their previously published experience (january of 1979 through august of 1995). between september of 1995 and may of 2005, 119 flap procedures were performed for lower extremity reconstruction. twenty-eight flaps (24 percent) were anastomosed distal to the zone of injury and 87 (76 percent) were anastomosed proximally. there were insufficient data on the location of the anastomosis for four free flaps (all successful). results: twenty-seven of 28 distal microvascular free flaps were successful (96 percent); two (7 percent) required emergent postoperative reexploration of the anastomosis. of the 87 proximal flaps, 79 (91 percent) were successful and eight (9 percent) failed. there was no statistically significant difference in the success rate of microvascular free flaps between the proximal and distal anastomosis groups (p = 0.30, fisher’s exact test). combined with the data from the authors’ previous series (january of 1979 to august of 1995), there were 63 free flaps with anastomosis performed distal to the zone of injury; 61 (97 percent) were successful. conclusion: the authors’ extensive 25-year experience with lower extremity reconstruction demonstrates that in appropriately selected patients, free tissue transfer to recipient vessels distal to the zone of injury is reliable and in certain cases preferable.
@method variability of quantal synaptic currents in thalamocortical neurons. techniques of in vitro whole-cell recording and compartmental modeling were combined to investigate dendritic structure and calcium currents in individual thalamocortical neurons. voltage-clamp recordings of i t obtained in intact and dissociated ventrobasal neurons were used to constrain i t conductances and passive parameters incorporated in morphorealistic models. high dendritic i t densities were found necessary to establish congruent model behavior. several methodologies based on axial resistance conservation were developed to algorithmically reduce thalamocortical morphology into a behaviorally congruent low-order compartmental model. this type of simplified model is suitable for investigating the functional role played by distal t- current localization at the network level in sleep oscillations and epilepsy.
@method viability of booby offspring is maximized by having one young parent and one old parent summary this paper describes and discusses graphical techniques, based on the primitive empirical cumulative distribution function and on quantile (q-q) plots, percent (p-p) plots and hybrids of these, which are useful in assessing a one-dimensional sample, either from original data or resulting from analysis. areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts;_ and the structuring of analysis of variance mean squares. many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples. this paper reviews a variety of old and new statistical techniques based on the cumulative distribution function and its ramifications. included in the coverage are applications, for various situations and purposes, of quantile probability plots (q-q plots), percentage probability plots (p-p plots) and extensions and hybrids of these. the general viewpoint is that of analysis of data by statistical methods that are suggestive and constructive rather than formal procedures to be applied in the light of a tightly specified mathematical model. the technological background is taken to be current capacities in data collection and highspeed computing systems, including graphical display facilities. it is very often useful in statistical data analysis to examine and to present a body of data as though it may have originated as a one-dimensional sample, i.e. data which one wishes to treat for purposes of analysis, as an unstructured array. sometimes this is applicable to ' original' data; even more often such a viewpoint is useful with 'derived' data, e.g. residuals from a model fitted to the data. the empirical cumulative distribution function and probability plotting methods have a key role in the statistical treatment of one-dimensional samples, being of relevance for summarization and palatable description as well as for exposure and inference.
@background isolation and characterization of a gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme a reductase from an endophytic taxol-producing fungus bt2 taxus cell culture may be an alternative source of paclitaxel and related taxane production. significantly increased amounts of paclitaxel and baccatin iii were observed in cultured cells of taxus species after exposure to methyl jasmonate. among the three species of taxus tested, taxus media showed the highest paclitaxel content while taxus baccata showed the highest baccatin iii content when 100 μm of methyl jasmonate was added to the culture media. furthermore, the activities of methyl jasmonate and related substances for inducing paclitaxel production were compared in cell suspension cultures of t. media. methyl jasmonate and its free acid showed the strongest promoting activity. reduction of the keto group at the c-3 position greatly reduced this activity. cis-jasmone, which does not have a carboxyl group at the c-1 position, had almost no activity. these results suggest that these two regions of methyl jasmonate are important for promoting the production of paclitaxel and related taxanes in taxus cell cultures.
@background endogenous swimming rhythms underlying the spawning migration of the blue crab, callinectes sapidus: ontogeny and variation with ambient tidal regime abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
@background crowdsourced idea generation: the effect of exposure to an original idea this brainstorming experiment assessed the extent to which idea exposure produced cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. one hundred and sixty participants were exposed to either a high or low number of common or unique ideas. the participants likelihood of engaging in social comparison processes (high or low) was also manipulated through instructional sets. the results indicated both cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. exposure to a high number of ideas and to common ideas enhanced the generation of additional ideas. the effects of exposure to a high number of ideas was greater under high than under low social comparison conditions. finally, recall of exposed ideas was related to enhanced idea generation. these results are consistent with the social/cognitive influence model of group brainstorming (paulus, dugosh, dzindolet, putman, & coskun, 2002). 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
@background perturbation of xenobiotic metabolism in dreissena polymorpha model exposed in situ to surface water (lake trasimene) purified with various disinfectants. trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichlo-romethane, and chlorodibromomethane) are common contaminants of chlorinated drinking water. although animal data indicate that these compounds may be reproductive toxicants, little information exists on their relation to spontaneous abortion in humans. we examined exposure to trihalomethanes and spontaneous abortion in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women in a prepaid health plan. seventy-eight drinking water utilities provided concurrent trihalomethane sampling data. we calculated total trihalomethane levels by averaging all measurements taken by the subject's utility during her first trimester. we calculated exposures to individual trihalomethanes in an analogous manner. women who drank ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥75 μg per liter total trihalomethanes had an adjusted odds ratio (or) of 1.8 for spontaneous abortion [95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.1–3.0]. of the four individual trihalomethanes, only high bromodichloromethane exposure (consumption of ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥18 μg per liter bromodichloromethane) was associated with spontaneous abortion both alone (adjusted or = 2.0; 95% cl = 1.2–3.5) and after adjustment for the other trihalomethanes (adjusted or = 3.0; 95% ci = 1.4–6.6).
@method incremental fine-grained information status classification using attention-based lstms recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due to the wide variation within the phenomenon, the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface markers and their relative rarity. we develop linguistically motivated discourse structure, lexico-semantic and genericity detection features and integrate these into a cascaded minority preference algorithm that models bridging recognition as a subtask of learning finegrained information status (is). we substantially improve bridging recognition without impairing performance on other is classes.
@method empathy or ownership? evidence from corticospinal excitability modulation during pain observation when we look at our hands, we immediately know that they are part of our own body. this feeling of ownership of our limbs is a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. we have studied the neuronal counterparts of this experience. a perceptual illusion was used to manipulate feelings of ownership of a rubber hand presented in front of healthy subjects while brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. the neural activity in the premotor cortex reflected the feeling of ownership of the hand. this suggests that multisensory integration in the premotor cortex provides a mechanism for bodily self-attribution.
@result recoding structural glycoprotein e2 in classical swine fever virus (csfv) produces complete virus attenuation in swine and protects infected animals against disease. abstract exploring the utility of de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stably attenuated polioviruses (pv), we followed two strategies to construct pv variants containing synthetic replacements of the capsid coding sequences either by deoptimizing synonymous codon usage (pv-ab) or by maximizing synonymous codon position changes of the existing wild-type (wt) poliovirus codons (pv-sd). despite 934 nucleotide changes in the capsid coding region, pv-sd rna produced virus with wild-type characteristics. in contrast, no viable virus was recovered from pv-ab rna carrying 680 silent mutations, due to a reduction of genome translation and replication below a critical level. after subcloning of smaller portions of the ab capsid coding sequence into the wt background, several viable viruses were obtained with a wide range of phenotypes corresponding to their efficiency of directing genome translation. surprisingly, when inoculated with equal infectious doses (pfu), even the most replication-deficient viruses appeared to be as pathogenic in pv-sensitive cd155tg (transgenic) mice as the pv(m) wild type. however, infection with equal amounts of virus particles revealed a neuroattenuated phenotype over 100-fold. direct analysis indicated a striking reduction of the specific infectivity of pv-ab-type virus particles. due to the distribution effect of many silent mutations over large genome segments, codon-deoptimized viruses should have genetically stable phenotypes, and they may prove suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of poliovirus vaccines.
@method anti-eye muscle igg and igm antibodies are associated with eye muscle type 2 deiodinase activities in hyperthyroid graves’ ophthalmopathy circulating igg and iga anti-thyroid and anti-eye muscle antibodies were investigated in 87 patients with graves' disease (60 cases with ophthalmopathy). the elisa method was used. both igg and iga antibodies were demonstrated against human thyroid and eye-muscle membrane or cytosol antigens. anti-eye-muscle antibodies of the iga type were observed more frequently than those of the igg type (25 cases vs. 18 were demonstrated with membrane antigens and 37 cases vs. 23 with cytosol antigens). the respective distributions for thyroid antigens the cytosol fraction were 55 cases vs. 13 and 18 cases vs. 36. a significant difference was observed in the anti-thyroid igg levels and the anti-eye-muscle membrane or cytosol levels between the patients with graves' disease and those in control group (p less than 0.001). the difference in the iga antibody to thyroid and eye-muscle antigens was significant between the patients with and without ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.002). the strong correlation between the levels of iga antibodies to thyroid and those to the eye-muscle cytosol fractions might be connected with the theory of the common aetiology of the thyroid and eye diseases in graves' ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.001). circulating iga anti-human thyroid and eye-muscle antibodies seemed to have a diagnostic relevance in the development of ophthalmopathy in graves' ophthalmopathy.

@background quantitative morphological analysis of the sensory epithelium of the starling and pigeon basilar papilla the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
@method dynamic correlation between intrahost hiv-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression abstract to understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection and the development of aids, we studied the evolution of the c2-v5 region of the hiv-1 env gene and of t-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. they were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the cxcr4 receptor (x4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases (∼1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. x4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. the late-phase transition was also associated with failure of t-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in cd3+ t cells) and decline of cd4+ t cells to ≤200 cells/μl. the strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and t-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of hiv-1 infection in moderate progressors. recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated hiv-1 infections.
@result magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of normal glenoid length and width: an anatomic study. we measured the dimensions of the humeral and glenoid articular surfaces in 140 shoulders that were representative of a given population of patients, and also evaluated several glenohumeral relationships. ninety-six measurements were made in the shoulders of cadavera and forty-four, on magnetic resonance-imaging studies of living patients. eighty-five per cent of the humeral measurements fell within eight fixed combinations of the radius of curvature and the thickness of the humeral head, in two-millimeter increments. the average radius of curvature of the humeral head in the coronal plane was 24 +/- 2.1 millimeters (range, nineteen to twenty-eight millimeters). the average thickness of the humeral head was 19 +/- 2.4 millimeters (range, fifteen to twenty-four millimeters). there was a wide variability in the size of the humeral head and a direct correlation between the differences in size and the heights in both men and women. the humeral articular surface was spherical in the center; however, the peripheral radius was two millimeters less in the axial plane than in the coronal plane. thus, the peripheral contour of the articular surface was elliptical (ratio, 0.92). the radius of curvature of the glenoid, measured in the coronal plane, was an average of 2.3 +/- 0.2 millimeters greater than that of the humeral head. the average dimensions of the glenoid in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior (lower half) directions were 39 +/- 3.5 millimeters (range, thirty to forty-eight millimeters) and 29 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, twenty-one to thirty-five millimeters). the anterior-posterior dimension of the glenoid was pear-shaped, the lower half being larger than the top half. the ratio of the lower half to the top half was 1:0.80 +/- 0.01. there was a strong linear correlation between the lateral humeral offset and the size of the humeral head (radius of curvature and thickness). the average lateral humeral offset was 56 +/- 5.7 millimeters (range, forty-three to sixty-seven millimeters). the superior most point on the humeral articular surface was an average of 8 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, three to twenty millimeters) cephalad to the top of the greater tuberosity. our data show that reconstruction of the lateral humeral offset is important in optimization of the moment arm of the deltoid and rotator cuff and of the normal tension of the soft tissue after prosthetic reconstruction.

@result prediction of adolescent outcome in children with disruptive behaviour disorders objective to clarify the developmental risk associated with hyperactive behavior, especially the relationship between hyperactive and conduct problems, in a longitudinal epidemiological design.   method a follow-up study of children who were identified, by parent and teacher ratings in a large community survey of 6- and 7-year-olds, as showing pervasive hyperactivity or conduct problems or the comorbid mixture of both problems or neither problem. they were later investigated, at the age of 16 to 18 years, with detailed interview techniques as well as parental and self-report ratings and cognitive tests.   results hyperactivity was a risk factor for later development, even allowing for the coexistence of conduct problems. its sequelae included a high likelihood of psychiatric diagnosis, persisting hyperactivity, violence and other antisocial behaviors, and social and peer problems.   conclusions the results suggested a developmental pathway through which hyperactivity raised the likelihood of impaired social adjustment, including the development of psychiatric disorders, independently of the existence of conduct problems.

@method simulating the cortical 3d visuomotor transformation of reach depth human saccades require a nonlinear, eye orientation-dependent reference frame transformation to transform visual codes to the motor commands for eye muscles. primate neurophysiology suggests that this transformation is performed between the superior colliculus and brain stem burst neurons, but provides little clues as to how this is done. to understand how the brain might accomplish this, we trained a 3-layer neural net to generate accurate commands for kinematically correct 3-d saccades. the inputs to the network were a 2-d, eye-centered, topographic map of gaussian visual receptive fields and an efference copy of eye position in 6-dimensional, push-pull "neural integrator" coordinates. the output was an eye orientation displacement command in similar coordinates appropriate to drive brain stem burst neurons. the network learned to generate accurate, kinematically correct saccades, including the eye orientation-dependent tilts in saccade motor error commands required to match saccade trajectories to their visual input. our analysis showed that the hidden units developed complex, eye-centered visual receptive fields, widely distributed fixed-vector motor commands, and "gain field"-like eye position sensitivities. the latter evoked subtle adjustments in the relative motor contributions of each hidden unit, thereby rotating the population motor vector into the correct correspondence with the visual target input for each eye orientation: a distributed population mechanism for the visuomotor reference frame transformation. these findings were robust; there was little variation across networks with between 9 and 49 hidden units. because essentially the same observations have been reported in the visuomotor transformations of the real oculomotor system, as well as other visuomotor systems (although interpreted elsewhere in terms of other models) we suggest that the mechanism for visuomotor reference frame transformations identified here is the same solution used in the real brain.
@background drug therapy in the prevention of failure of the fontan circulation: a systematic review objectivea single dose of sildenafil improves exercise capacity in fontan patients. however, a recent study failed to show a long-term effect of sildenafil. this study evaluated whether there are factors that might predict sildenafil effects.methodswe studied 36 patients (16–42 years, 14 female) with univentricular heart after various modifications of the fontan surgery (13 apc, 16 avc, 7 tcpc). they performed two cardiopulmonary exercise tests, with at least 120 min rest and a single dose of 50 mg sildenafil in between.resultsafter sildenafil administration, patients improved their peak oxygen uptake from 64.5 to 67.3 % predicted (p = 0.0003) without change in ventilatory efficiency ($${\dot{\text{v}}}_{\text{e}} /{\dot{\text{v}}\text{co}}_{2}$$v˙e/v˙co2 slope), oxygen saturation (spo2) at rest or at peak exercise, respiratory exchange ratio. in addition, resting systolic blood pressure was slightly reduced after sildenafil administration. there was a moderate negative correlation of this improvement to baseline peak oxygen uptake (r = −0.395; p = 0.017). the change in peak oxygen uptake could not be correlated to time of surgery, type of surgery, nt-pro-bnp, or to other clinical data. nevertheless, all four patients with nt-pro-bnp levels higher than 1,000 pg/ml had the most prominent improvements in exercise capacity.conclusionsfontan patients have an improved exercise capacity after a single dose of sildenafil. patients with worse baseline peak oxygen uptake profit more.
@method characterization of the renal phenotype in a mouse model of marfan syndrome in the past, there has been considerable concern that treatment with active vitamin d might accelerate progression independent of hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. nevertheless, 1,25(oh)2d3 has known antiproliferative properties and has also been shown to inhibit renal growth. since glomerular growth is a permissive factor for the development of glomerulosclerosis, we reasoned that 1,25(oh)2d3 might even attenuate progression. to test this working hypothesis we performed two experiments of 8 and 16 weeks duration, respectively, to compare subtotally nephrectomized (snx) rats treated with ethanol and snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3. control animals were sham operated and pair-fed with snx animals. 1,25(oh)2d3 (3 ng/100 g body wt/day) was administered by osmotic minipump. 1,25(oh)2d3 had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure and only a transient effect on weight gain. snx reduced the number of glomeruli (left kidney) from an average of 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(4) per kidney. mean glomerular volume was 3.87 +/- 0.71 x 10(6) microns 3 in sham operated animals and significantly (p < 0.05) higher (10.1 +/- 1.75 x 10(6) microns 3) in untreated animals 16 weeks after snx. glomerular volume was significantly (p < 0.05) less in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx [10.1 +/- 1.75 in ethanol vs. 7.04 +/- 1.78 in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx]. in parallel, there was significantly (p < 0.01) less glomerulosclerosis [glomerulosclerosis index 1.16 +/- 0.14 in the ethanol treated snx vs. 0.80 +/- 0.16 in snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3] in the eight week experiment. albuminuria was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated than in ethanol treated snx (mean 0.785 mg/24 hr, range 0.43 to 1.80, vs. 3.75 mg/24 hr, 1.29 to 14.2). the morphological data were directionally analogous in a second 16 week experiment. only slight changes of the vascular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial index were seen in snx and were not affected by 1,25(oh)2d3 further. to prove that the effect of 1,25(oh)2d3 was independent of pth, parathyreoidectomized snx rats without or with 1,25(oh)2d3 treatment were examined seven days post-snx. pcna staining showed suppression of cell proliferation. furthermore, in situ hybridization for transforming growth factor-b (tgf-beta) showed less vascular and tubular expression in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated rats. we conclude that 1,25(oh)2d3 has antiproliferative actions during the compensatory growth of nephrons in response to subtotal nephrectomy. these effects are independent of pth. the data document that 1,25(oh)2d3 reduces renal cell proliferation and glomerular growth as well as glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria as indicators of progressive glomerular damage.
@background potentiating and synergistic effect of grapefruit juice on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of aripiprazole against hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress in mice abstract obesity has been associated with a marked risk of metabolic diseases and requires therapeutic strategies. changes in redox status with increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue have been linked with obesity-related disorders. thus, the biological effect of antioxidants such as polyphenols is of high interest. we aimed to measure antioxidant capacities of 28 polyphenols representative of main dietary phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and curcuminoids. then, 14 molecules were selected for the evaluation of their effect on 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and human red blood cells exposed to oxidative stress. analysis of reducing and free radical-scavenging capacities of compounds revealed antioxidant properties related to their structure, with higher activities for flavonoids such as quercetin and epicatechin. their effects on preadipocytes’ viability also depended on their structure, dose and time of exposure. interestingly, most of the compounds exhibited a protective effect on preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress, by reversing h2o2-induced anti-proliferative action and reactive oxygen species production. polyphenols also exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on preadipocytes exposed to h2o2 by reducing il-6 secretion. importantly, such antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were observed in co-exposition (polyphenol and prooxidant during 24 h) or pretreatment (polyphenol during 24 h, then prooxidant for 24 h) conditions. moreover, compounds protected erythrocytes from aaph radical-induced lysis. finally, these results led to demonstrate that antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols may depend on structure, dose, time of exposure and cell conditioning with oxidative stress. such findings should be considered for a better understanding of polyphenols’ benefits in strategies aiming to prevent obesity-related diseases.
@background effect of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol supplementations on serum leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum amyloid a levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus we prospectively examined the relationship between leptin and markers of insulin resistance and secretion and future visceral adipose tissue accumulation. in this study, 518 nondiabetic japanese-american men and women underwent the following measurements at baseline and at 5- and 10-year follow-ups: plasma glucose and insulin measured after an overnight fast and during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion ratio (isr) [(30-min insulin - fasting insulin)/30-min glucose], fasting c-peptide levels, plasma leptin (baseline only), and fat areas (intra-abdominal and subcutaneous) measured by computed tomography. predictors of future intra-abdominal fat (iaf) were determined using multiple linear regression. fasting insulin and c-peptide levels at baseline were significantly associated with iaf area at 5 years (coefficient = 0.041, p = 0.001 and coefficient = 1.283, p < 0.001, respectively) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.031, p = 0.020 and coefficient = 0.221, p = 0.035, respectively). isr was not significantly associated with iaf at 5 or 10 years. leptin level at baseline was positively associated with iaf at 5 years (coefficient = 0.055, p = 0.002) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.059, p = 0.003). in conclusion, higher levels of fasting insulin, c-peptide, and circulating leptin level predicted visceral fat accumulation independent from subcutaneous fat accumulation in nondiabetic japanese-american men and women in both short-term (5 years) and long-term (10 years) follow-up.
@method developing a clinical teaching quality questionnaire for use in a university osteopathic pre-registration teaching program previous research evaluating the performance of horn's parallel analysis (pa) factor retention method with ordinal variables has produced unexpected findings. specifically, pa with pearson correlations has performed as well as or better than pa with the more theoretically appropriate polychoric correlations. seeking to clarify these findings, the current study employed a more comprehensive simulation study that included the systematic manipulation of 7 factors related to the data (sample size, factor loading, number of variables per factor, number of factors, factor correlation, number of response categories, and skewness) as well as 3 factors related to the pa method (type of correlation matrix, extraction method, and eigenvalue percentile). the results from the simulation study show that pa with either pearson or polychoric correlations is particularly sensitive to the sample size, factor loadings, number of variables per factor, and factor correlations. however, whereas pa with polychorics is relatively robust to the skewness of the ordinal variables, pa with pearson correlations frequently retains difficulty factors and is generally inaccurate with large levels of skewness. in light of these findings, we recommend the use of pa with polychoric correlations for the dimensionality assessment of ordinal-level data.
@result lack of the matricellular protein sparc (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) attenuates liver fibrogenesis in mice the matricellular protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc) modulates cell adhesion, proliferation, matrix deposition, and tissue remodeling. sparc has been shown to regulate the expression of collagen type i and transforming growth factor-beta1 in mesangial cells and to be highly expressed during tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rat angiotensin (ang) ii infusion models. we hypothesized that sparc is a downstream effector of ang ii and that loss of host sparc function provides a protective effect on renal damage and fibrosis associated with ang ii hypertension. our results revealed that cultured primary mesangial cells displayed a concentration-dependent increase in sparc expression in response to ang ii. after a 14-day chronic infusion of ang ii, hypertensive sparc-null mice exhibited significantly attenuated levels of urinary and renal indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation and decreased renal perivascular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis relative to wild-type hypertensive controls. moreover, the observed renal protective changes in sparc-null mice were found to be independent of blood pressure. these results identify sparc as an effector of ang ii signaling and suggest an important role for sparc in mediating ang ii-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.
@result oxytocin selectively facilitates learning with social feedback and increases activity and functional connectivity in emotional memory and reward processing regions the neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in the development and maintenance of attachment behaviours in humans and other species. little is known, however, about how it affects judgements of unfamiliar others. in a double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated the effect of a single intranasal dose of oxytocin on judgements of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness. we found that oxytocin administration increased ratings of trustworthiness and attractiveness of male and female targets in raters of both sexes relative to control ratings, suggesting that higher levels of this neuropeptide may enhance affiliative behaviour towards unfamiliar others. our results provide evidence in support of a general facilitative role of oxytocin in promoting positive trait judgements.
@method changes in accommodative responses with multifocal contact lenses: a pilot study dynamics of accommodation (far-to-near focus) and disaccommodation (near-to-far focus) are described as a function of response amplitude. accommodative responses to step stimuli of various amplitudes presented in real space were measured in eight 20-30 year old subjects. responses were fitted with exponential functions to determine amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. despite the intersubject variability, the results show that time constants of accommodation and peak velocity of disaccommodation increase with amplitude in all subjects. the dynamics of accommodation and disaccommodation are dependent on amplitude, but have different properties in each case.
@background combination of epinephrine with esmolol attenuates post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction in a porcine model of cardiac arrest apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an active metabolic response to physiological signals or exposure to cytotoxic agents. recent evidence has shown that the cell death response can be modified by agents presumed to be unrelated to the initial signal, but capable of interfering with the molecular mechanisms of the apoptotic pathway progression. here we show the results of investigations on the use of a phospholipid-based pharmaceutical preparation for suppression of myocardial damage. first, we show that serum or serum/glucose deprivation, in vitro ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, inhibition of protein synthesis, and treatment with ceramide, staurosporine, adriamycin, cis-platinum and menadione induce apoptotic death in a primary culture of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. then we demonstrate that a mixture of specific phospholipids, which has been originally purified from soy flour on the basis of its anti-apoptotic activity, prevents cardiomyocyte death induced by serum or serum/glucose deprivation, by ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, and by ceramide, but not by other cytotoxic treatments. this suggests that ceramide, a lipid secondary messenger which triggers apoptosis induced by some cytotoxic agents, may be involved in the process of signaling ischemia/reperfusion induced apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes. these results further demonstrate that an active pharmaceutical preparation for the suppression of cardiomyocyte death can be formulated based upon a novel strategy of apoptosis modification.
@background assembly of membrane-bound respiratory complexes by the tat protein-transport system protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane has been studied extensively in escherichia coli. the identification of the components involved and subsequent reconstitution of the purified translocation reaction have defined the minimal constituents that allowed extensive biochemical characterization of the so‐called translocase. this functional enzyme complex consists of the secyeg integral membrane protein complex and a peripherally bound atpase, seca. under translocation conditions, four secyeg heterotrimers assemble into one large protein complex, forming a putative protein‐conducting channel. this tetrameric arrangement of secyeg complexes and the highly dynamic seca dimer together form a proton‐motive force‐ and atp‐driven molecular machine that drives the stepwise translocation of targeted polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane. recent findings concerning the translocase structure and mechanism of protein translocation are discussed and shine new light on controversies in the field.
@background differential responses of pancreatic β-cells to ros and rns. apoptotic and necrotic cell death are well characterized and are influenced by intracellular atp levels. poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), a nuclear enzyme activated by dna strand breaks, physiologically participates in dna repair. overactivation of parp after cellular insults can lead to cell death caused by depletion of the enzyme's substrate beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and of atp. in this study, we have differentially elicited apoptosis or necrosis in mouse fibroblasts. fibroblasts from parp-deficient (parp(-/-)) mice are protected from necrotic cell death and atp depletion but not from apoptotic death. these findings, together with cell death patterns in parp(-/-) animals receiving other types of insults, indicate that parp activation is an active trigger of necrosis, whereas other mechanisms mediate apoptosis.
@background transcriptional regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism after dietary soyabean meal treatment in atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.). the regulatory control mechanisms of lipid and fatty acid metabolism were investigated in atlantic salmon. we identified sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) genes in salmon and characterised their response, and the response of potential target and other regulatory genes including liver x receptor (lxr), to cholesterol and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufa) in the salmon established cell line, shk-1. two cdnas for srebps homologous to mammalian srebp-1 and srebp-2 were characterised. we identified three groups of genes whose expression responded differently to the treatments. one group of genes, including cholesterol biosynthetic genes, showed increased expression in response to lipid depletion but supplementary cholesterol or lc-pufa had no further effect. the expression of a second group of genes belonging to fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, included fatty acid synthase, δ6 and δ5 fatty acyl desaturases, also increased after lipid depletion but this was negated by cholesterol or by lc-pufa supplementation. the expression of a third group of genes including acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 elongase was increased by cholesterol treatment but was not affected by lipid depletion or by lc-pufa. this same pattern of expression was also shown by liver x receptor (lxr), indicating that acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 are possible direct targets of lxr. this suggests that salmon elovl5 may be regulated differently from mammalian elovl5, which is an indirect target of lxr, responding to lxr-dependent increases in srebp-1.
@background specific effects of a calorie-based intervention on stair climbing in overweight commuters objectives: there is evidence that poster prompts increase stair use. the present study was concerned with the effects of poster size, poster message, and setting on stair use. design: using a quasi-experimental design, four observational studies were undertaken in which stair and escalator use were logged during 2-week baseline periods and 2-week intervention periods. methods: in the first two studies, observations were undertaken in two shopping centres (total n = 30,018) with the size of poster varying. in the other two studies (total n = 37,907), one in a shopping centre and one in a train station, two poster messages were tested in both sites. results: pedestrian traffic volume was controlled for statistically. there were significant increases in stair use with a1- and a2-, but not a3-size posters. overall, the two different poster messages were both effective in encouraging stair use. interactions between gender and message setting, however, reflected the fact that the 'stay healthy, save time' poster had little impact on female shoppers but was highly effective for female commuters. conclusion: these results suggest that developers of health-promotion posters pay attention to poster size. they also indicate that it is insufficient to segment audiences by gender without considering the setting and motivational context.
@method why is the ratio of reflectivity effective for chlorophyll estimation in the lake water? a new uv submersible spectroradiometer has been employed to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance in the clearest natural waters [k(w)(lambda)] with emphasis on the spectral region from 300 to 400 nm. k(w)(lambda) can be related to the inherent optical properties of pure water, in particular the total absorption coefficient a(w)(lambda) and the molecular scattering coefficient b(m)(lambda), by means of equations derived from radiative transfer theory. we present an analysis showing that limiting values of k(w)(lambda) can be estimated from a(w)(lambda) and vice versa. published a(w)(lambda) data, which show discrepancies much larger than their estimated accuracies, are briefly reviewed and then compared, via our analysis, with k(w)(lambda) data (our own new and previously published data as well as relevant data of others). this comparative analysis and new data allow a consistent and accurate set of optical properties for the clearest natural waters and for pure fresh water and saltwater to be estimated from 300 to 800 nm.
@background high glucose level inhibits capacitative ca2 + influx in cultured rat mesangial cells by a protein kinase c-dependent mechanism high extracellular glucose activates protein kinase c (pkc), a family of kinases vital to intracellular signaling. however, which pkc isoforms are involved and where in the cell they operate is unclear. we tested the hypothesis that only those pkc isoforms binding to diacylglycerol (dag) are activated by high glucose. we also reasoned that the isoforms would translocate to different parts of the cell, where they presumably serve different functions. the pkc isoforms alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and zeta were studied. twenty mm glucose caused an increase in total pkc activity at six hours, which was maintained at 24 hours. high glucose decreased the angiotensin ii-induced calcium signal. this effect was reversed by preincubating the cells with the pkc inhibitor staurosporine. glucose induced a translocation of all pkc isoforms except pkc zeta by western blot. confocal microscopy showed that pkc alpha, beta, and epsilon were translocated into the nucleus. pkc delta showed strong association with cytoskeletal structures. the effects were sustained at 24 hours for pkc isoform beta and to a lesser extent for pkc delta and epsilon, but not for pkc alpha. thus, pkc isoforms differ in their propensity to be activated by high glucose. those isoforms binding to dag are activated. both cytoskeletal and nuclear signaling may be involved.
@method ultrasonographic classification of achilles tendon ruptures as a rationale for individual treatment selection objective minimally invasive suture of the torn achilles tendon without opening the rupture site, reduction in the risk of a sural nerve lesion, and optimization of stump apposition.   indications fresh achilles tendon rupture.   contraindications chronic achillodynia, local corticoid injections, immunosuppressive therapy, old achilles tendon ruptures, rerupture.   surgical technique suture of the achilles tendon with a special instrument via a skin incision proximal to the rupture, without opening the peritenon or the rupture site, whereby the suture in the area of the proximal achilles tendon is placed in the layer between the lower-leg fascia and the peritenon with the threads running in a paratendinous direction.   results from january 1, 2000 to december 31, 2003, 61 patients with 62 achilles tendon ruptures were sutured using the percutaneous technique with the dresden instrument. no sural nerve lesions and only two reruptures (3.2%) were observed. in one patient (1.6%) a superficial late infection occurred after 8 weeks, when the tendon was already healed. of 47 patients with a follow-up time of at least 1 year, 39 with 40 achilles tendon ruptures were followed up (83%). according to the criteria of trillat & mounier-kuhn, the result was very good in 62% and good in 30%. on the aofas score, an average of 96 points (78-100 points) was achieved. 78% of the patients assessed the result of the treatment as very good and 20% as good.
@result link between motor competence and health related fitness in children and adolescents children with low motor competence (lmc) are less able to participate fully in many sports and recreational activities typically enjoyed by their well-coordinated peers. poor fitness outcomes have been reported for these children, although previous studies have not tracked these outcomes over time. in this study, 19 children (8 girls and 11 boys) with lmc aged between 5 and 7years were matched by age and gender with 19 children with high motor competence (hmc). six fitness (body composition and cardiovascular endurance) and motor skill (sprint run, standing broad jump and balance) measures were repeated for each group once a year for five years. for each year of the study, the lmc groups performed less well on all measures than the hmc groups. changes over time were significantly different between groups for cardiovascular endurance, 50-m run and balance, but not for body composition, overhand throw or standing broad jump. between the two groups, performances were significantly different for all measures, except body composition. these findings confirm the impact of lmc on fitness measures and skill performances over time.
@background oral mucosal status and salivary iga levels of hiv-infected children. objective conducted a literature review to identify studies that reported on the oral manifestations in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected children in highly active antiretrovial therapy (haart) era.   methods a search electronic data base were used and the terms used were 'oral lesions' and 'oral manifestations'. the studies of prevalence of oral manifestation in children with hiv worldwide, descriptive studies, case reports, studies on the association of oral lesions and levels of immune suppression, use of haart and transmission of hiv were included.   results there have been substantial changes in the management of hiv disease, especially in the past decade because of the use of haart. however, children are still being infected and present some peculiarities when compared with adults. molecular epidemiology, transmission and therapy of the common opportunistic oral infections of hiv disease need to be better understood as a consequence of improved anti-hiv strategies. treatment with haart improves the immune function and decreases mortality, morbidity, and opportunistic infections in hiv-infected persons.   conclusion the frequency and severity of oral disease associated with hiv infection have reduced considerably, although the use of haart may be associated with an increased appearance of oral lesions associated with human papillomavirus and potentially increase the risk of later oral squamous cell carcinoma.
@background disease surveillance on complex social networks background multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. in theory, community structure—aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups—within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. however, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. objective the aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. methods we used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public wi-fi internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. we characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. we classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network’s ability to produce multiwave epidemics. results we identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. this pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. conclusions our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.
@method three-column osteotomy for correction of cervical and cervicothoracic deformities: alignment changes and early complications in a multicenter prospective series of 23 patients sagittal spinal misalignment (ssm) is an established cause of pain and disability. treating physicians must be familiar with the radiographic findings consistent with ssm. additionally, the restoration or maintenance of physiological sagittal spinal alignment after reconstructive spinal procedures is imperative to achieve good clinical outcomes. the c-7 plumb line (sagittal vertical axis) has traditionally been used to evaluate sagittal spinal alignment; however, recent data indicate that the measurement of spinopelvic parameters provides a more comprehensive assessment of sagittal spinal alignment. in this review the authors describe the proper analysis of spinopelvic alignment for surgical planning. online videos supplement the text to better illustrate the key concepts.
@background lack of seasonal variation in the life-history strategies of the trematode coitocaecum parvum: no apparent environmental effect. the fundamental question of how complex life cycles—where there is typically more than one host—evolve in host–parasite systems remains largely unexplored. we suggest that complex cycles in helminths without penetrative infective stages evolve by two essentially different processes, depending on where in the cycle a new host is inserted. in ‘upward incorporation’, a new definitive host, typically higher up a food web and which preys on the original definitive host, is added. advantages to the parasite are avoidance of mortality due to the predator, greater body size at maturity and higher fecundity. the original host typically becomes an intermediate host, in which reproduction is suppressed. in ‘downward incorporation’, a new intermediate host is added at a lower trophic level; this reduces mortality and facilitates transmission to the original definitive host. these two processes should also apply in helminths with penetrative infective stages, although the mathematical conditions differ.
@result imaging attentional modulation of pain in the periaqueductal gray in humans electrical brain stimulation is effective in controlling certain intractable chronic pain syndromes in humans, but the specific target site(s) for stimulation producing a maximal analgesic effect is (are) not well defined. this prospective study correlates the clinical results of chronic stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (pag) and periventricular gray (pvg) matter in humans with the anatomic site of electrode placement as determined at autopsy, and documents the histologic reactions to electrode implantation and electrical stimulation of the area. seven patients underwent electrode implantation to control their chronic pain; two had electrodes implanted bilaterally. all patients obtained complete analgesia with stimulation, although 3 subsequently found the stimulation to have diminished efficacy. the opiate antagonist naloxone reversed the analgesia in the 4 patients so tested. all 7 patients later died of causes unrelated to electrode implantation or stimulation. postmortem analysis showed that, for 6 of the 9 electrodes implanted, the electrode tip was located in the ventrolateral pag at the level of the posterior commissure; the other 3 electrodes were found in the white matter adjacent to the pag. no evidence of gliosis or parenchymal reaction was observed along the tracts and tips of the electrodes. the results indicate that the ventrolateral pag and pvg matter at the level of the posterior commissure is the optimal site for therapeutic electrical brain stimulation for opiate-responsive pain in humans.
@method dual-robot ultrasound-guided needle placement: closing the planning-imaging-action loop in both photoacoustic (pa) and ultrasonic (us) imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. consequently, with the increased use of combined pa and us (paus) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. to this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, intralipid® 20% iv fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while india ink, direct red 81, and evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. the following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 mhz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 mhz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of paus imaging studies.
@result methylated-rich regions and tandem repeat arrays along the chromosome complement of colpodium versicolor (stev.) schmalh summary.haplopappus gracilis (nutt.) gray, one of the five known higher plants with a chromosome number of 2n = 4, was studied from a cytological point of view. the chromosome complement of this species was characterized by means of automated karyotype analysis. moreover, the dna methylation pattern and fluorochrome banding were determined and compared with cytological data present in the literature. dna methylation distribution along metaphase chromosomes involved all chromosome territories evidenced by c-banding. other methylated bands correlated positively with aceto-orcein-positive heterochromatic portions and/or with late replicating bands and/or fluorochrome bands. some methylated bands showed differences between homologous chromosomes. these bands belonged partly to certain heterochromatic domains and partly to intercalary sites not defined by other standard banding techniques. differences between the homologues were also indicated by our dna content data obtained after dnase i digestion.
@method converting redox signaling to apoptotic activities by stress-responsive regulators hsf1 and nrf2 in fenretinide treated cancer cells background the lipid second messenger ceramide, which is generated by acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases or ceramide synthases, is a common intermediate of many apoptotic pathways. metabolism of ceramide involves several enzymes, including glucosylceramide synthase and gd3 synthase, and results in the formation of gangliosides (gm3, gd3, and gt3), which in turn promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) and apoptosis. fenretinide, a retinoic acid derivative, is thought to induce apoptosis via increases in ceramide levels, but the link between ceramide and subsequent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells is unclear.   methods sh-sy5y and htla230 neuroblastoma cells were treated with fenretinide in the presence or absence of inhibitors of enzymes important in ceramide metabolism (fumonisin b1, inhibitor of ceramide synthase; desipramine, inhibitor of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases; and pdmp, inhibitor of glucosylceramide). small interfering rnas were used to specifically block acidic sphingomyelinase or gd3 synthase activities. apoptosis, ros, and gd3 expression were measured by flow cytometry.   results in neuroblastoma cells, ros generation and apoptosis were associated with fenretinide-induced increased levels of ceramide, glucosylceramide synthase activity, gd3 synthase activity, and gd3. fenretinide also induced increased levels of gd2, a ganglioside derived from gd3. inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase but not of neutral sphingomyelinase or ceramide synthase, blocked fenretinide-induced increases in ceramide, ros, and apoptosis. exogenous gd3 induced ros and apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells but not in sh-sy5y cells treated with baicalein, a specific 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor. exogenous gd2 did not induce apoptosis.   conclusions a novel pathway of fenretinide-induced apoptosis is mediated by acidic sphingomyelinase, glucosylceramide synthase, and gd3 synthase, which may represent targets for future drug development. gd3 may be a key signaling intermediate leading to apoptosis via the activation of 12-lipoxygenase.
@background the ccr4-not complex interacts with the mrna export machinery protein arginine methylation is an emergent post-translational modification involved in a growing number of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, rna processing and dna repair. although protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (prmt1) is the major arginine methyltransferase in mammals, little is known about the regulation of its activity, except for the regulation induced by interaction with the antiproliferative protein btg1 (b-cell translocation gene 1). since the protein hcaf1 (ccr4-associated factor 1) was described to interact with btg1, we investigated a functional link between hcaf1 and prmt1. by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments we demonstrated that endogenous hcaf1 and prmt1 interact in vivo and colocalize in nuclear speckles, a sub-nuclear compartment enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and splicing factors. in vitro methylation assays indicated that hcaf1 is not a substrate for prmt1-mediated methylation, but it regulates prmt1 activity in a substrate-dependent manner. moreover, small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated silencing of hcaf1 in mcf-7 cells significantly modulates the methylation of endogenous prmt1 substrates. finally, we demonstrated that in vitro and in the cellular context, hcaf1 regulates the methylation of sam68 and histone h4, two prmt1 substrates. since hcaf1 and prmt1 have been involved in the regulation of transcription and rna metabolism, we speculate that hcaf1 and prmt1 could contribute to the crosstalk between transcription and rna processing.
@background decreased fibrinolytic activity is associated with carotid artery stiffening in arterial hypertension aim a prothrombotic state is associated with organ damage in hypertensive patients. carotid intima-media thickness (imt) is an early marker of vascular damage that anticipates the development of atherosclerotic plaques. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between subclinical carotid damage and markers of the prothrombotic state in hypertension.   methods in 258 essential hypertensive patients who were consecutively recruited at a hypertension clinic an ultrasound carotid scan was performed with assessment of the imt and plasma levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) were measured.   results patients with an imt above the median of the distribution (800 µm) were older and had greater bmi, pulse pressure, duration of hypertension, and prevalence of coronary heart disease than patients with an imt below the median. patients with higher imt had also greater levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and homocysteine. regression analysis showed a direct relationship of imt with age, waist circumference, pulse pressure, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and number of cigarettes smoked per day, and an inverse relationship with creatinine clearance. on multivariate analysis, age, pulse pressure, and fibrin d-dimer were independently related with imt.   conclusion in hypertensive patients, subclinical carotid damage is related with evidence of activated coagulation system suggesting a prothrombotic state. this might contribute to the development of hypertensive arterial damage even in the earliest stages.
@background loss of correction in spinal cord injury-related scoliosis after pedicle screw fixation object pedicle screw fixation has been theorized to provide better correction of scoliotic deformity, but controversy over the benefits of pedicle screw-only constructs remains, and the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs is unclear. in this study, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted to determine the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (ais).   methods the authors retrospectively reviewed a multicenter database of pediatric patients (ages ≤ 18) from 1995 to 2006 and identified 127 patients with lenke type 1-4 ais curves with a minimum 5 years of follow-up. patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on whether they had undergone pedicle screw fixation or fixation with hybrid constructs.   results the mean main thoracic curvature of 56.1° ± 13.0°, which corrected to 14.9° ± 9.3°, translated into a mean correction of 73% (p < 0.01). the curve was 19.4° ± 10.6° at 2-year follow-up and 20.5° ± 10.4° at 5 years. when comparing preoperative parameters between the groups, differences were noted in the magnitude of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.04), flexibility of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.02), coronal balance (p = 0.04), t2-12 kyphosis (p = 0.02), and sex (p = 0.02). the pedicle screw cohort had fewer spinal segments instrumented (p < 0.01), fewer anterior releases performed (p = 0.02), and fewer thoracoplasties performed (p < 0.01). by 5 years of follow-up, significant differences were apparent between the two cohorts with respect to upper thoracic curvature (p = 0.01), t2-12 (p = 0.02) and t5-12 (p = 0.02) kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (p < 0.01), and sagittal balance (p = 0.01).   conclusions although some preoperative differences did exist, outcomes were comparable between hybrid and screw constructs at 2 and 5 years. however, hybrid constructs required more concurrent anterior releases and thoracoplasties to achieve similar results.
@background pharmacy students ' care improved hba 1 c levels and quality of life of patients with diabetes objectives the current study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of delivering diabetes education in either a group or individual setting using a consistent, evidence-based curriculum.   research design and methods a total of 170 subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either group (n = 87) or individual (n = 83) educational settings. subjects received education in four sequential sessions delivered at consistent time intervals over a 6-month period. outcomes included changes in knowledge, self-management behaviors, weight, bmi, hba(1c), health-related quality of life, patient attitudes, and medication regimen. changes were assessed at baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions.   results both educational settings had similar improvements in knowledge, bmi, health-related quality of life, attitudes, and all other measured indicators. hba(1c) decreased from 8.5 +/- 1.8% at baseline to 6.5 +/- 0.8% at 6 months (p < 0.01) in the study population as a whole. subjects assigned to the individual setting had a 1.7 +/- 1.9% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01), whereas subjects assigned to the group setting had a 2.5 +/- 1.8% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01). the difference in hba(1c) improvement was marginally greater in subjects assigned to group education versus individualized education (p = 0.05).   conclusions this study demonstrates that diabetes education delivered in a group setting, when compared with an individual setting, was equally effective at providing equivalent or slightly greater improvements in glycemic control. group diabetes education was similarly effective in delivering key educational components and may allow for more efficient and cost-effective methods in the delivery of diabetes education programs.
@background detecting representations of recent and remote autobiographical memories in vmpfc and hippocampus a fundamental question in memory research is how our brains can form enduring memories. in humans, memories of everyday life depend initially on the medial temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus. as these memories mature, they are thought to become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the cortex. little is understood about how new memories in the hippocampus are transformed into remote memories in cortical networks. however, recent studies have begun to shed light on how remote memories are organized in the cortex, and the molecular and cellular events that underlie their consolidation.

@background rats ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia in fructose feeding and intermittent hypoxia affect abstract—hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are closely associated with hypertension in humans and in animal models. gender differences have been found in the development of hypertension in fructose-fed rats. the objectives of the present study were, first, to clarify whether androgens are required in the development of hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension in fructose-fed rats, and second, to determine if cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 are also increased in the arteries of these rats. male rats were gonadectomized or sham-operated and fed a 60% fructose diet beginning at age 7 weeks. blood pressure was measured by a tail-cuff method, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed to assess insulin sensitivity after 8 weeks of fructose feeding. cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 mrna expression was also assessed in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries. gonadectomy prevented hypertension from developing in the fructose-fed rats, but hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance developed. there was an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries of the fructose-fed sham-operated rats while the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 remained unchanged. gonadectomy prevented the mrna overexpression of vascular cyclooxygenase-2 in the fructose-fed rats. these results suggest that the presence of androgens is necessary for the development of fructose-induced hypertension. androgens apparently act as a link between hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance and hypertension in fructose-hypertensive rats. furthermore, an increase in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 is implicated in the development of hypertension. the mechanisms involved require further study.
@result effects of visual biofeedback therapy on postural balance of stroke patients objective to examine the physiologic and functional recovery of standing balance and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in people after mild and moderate stroke.   design inception cohort study with evaluations at 1 month and 3 months poststroke.   setting laboratory.   participants twenty-nine volunteers who had sustained a stroke. subjects were categorized into mild and moderate groups.   interventions not applicable.   main outcome measures functional balance was assessed (clinical outcome variables scale [covs]) and physiologic measures (electromyography, postural sway) were taken when subjects stood quietly on a force platform and when they performed a rapid unilateral arm-raise perturbation. the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) was administered to evaluate hrqol.   results subjects in the mild group were approaching maximal scores on the covs (87.7+/-4.1/91) at 3 months poststroke, yet had significant impairment in paretic muscle activation patterns when compared with healthy subjects. subjects in the moderate group had increased paretic muscle activation over the 2 months, accompanied by significant increases of 10.7+/-5.9 points on the covs. for both groups, there was significantly less postural sway on the paretic than the nonparetic leg and significant improvements in the sf-36 (physical component) over time.   conclusions subjects recovering from a stroke showed a significant improvement in physical hrqol and functional and physiologic balance, yet the physiologic balance recovery was not complete even in the mild group.
@background distinct spatiotemporal expression of serine proteases prss23 and prss35 in periimplantation mouse uterus and dispensable function of prss35 in fertility abstract the objective of the present study was to determine how low progesterone (p4) affects the endometrial transcriptome, with specific emphasis on those changes that may impact conceptus elongation. following estrous synchronization and detection (estrus = day 0, n = 40), heifers were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 12) or a low p4 group (n = 28). heifers in the low p4 group had consistently lower p4 concentrations compared to controls (p < 0.05). microarray analysis of endometrial gene expression revealed low p4 altered the expression of 498 differentially expressed genes (degs; 215 up- and 283 down-regulated) on day 7 and 351 degs (272 up- and 79 down-regulated) on day 13. a similar number of temporal changes occurred between day 7 and day 13 in both groups (2212 in heifers with normal p4 compared with 2247 in heifers with low p4); of these degs, 1278 were common to both groups. little overlap in the number of degs affected by high or low p4 was observed across days. comparison of the temporal changes that occur during normal estrous cycle progression (i.e., from day 7 to day 13) to those affected by altered p4 found significant numbers of genes were modulated by elevated (4157) and decreased (809) p4 alone. analysis of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr and in situ hybridization revealed that expression of mep1b, nid2, and prss23 increased on day 13 compared to day 7 (p < 0.05) and that the magnitude of increase was significantly diminished in heifers with low p4 compared to controls. mep1b predominantly localized to the both the superficial and deep glandular epithelium (ge), nid2 localized to the deep ge, whereas prss23 localized only to the luminal epithelium. in conclusion, we have determined the global changes in the endometrial transcriptome induced by decreasing the output of p4 from the corpus luteum in vivo using a unique animal model. placing these data into context with previous data in which p4 was supplemented or elevated after ovulation, we have identified a panel of genes that are truly regulated in the endometrium by circulating concentrations of p4 in vivo and that likely impact conceptus elongation.
@result effects of exercise on muscle metabolites and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in ovariectomized rats. sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+ uptake and ca2+-mg2+-atpase activity were examined in muscle homogenates and the purified sr fraction of the superficial and deep fibers of the gastrocnemius and vastus muscles of the rat after treadmill runs of 20 or 45 min or to exhaustion (avg time to exhaustion 140 min). vesicle intactness and cross-contamination of isolated sr were estimated using a calcium ionophore and mitochondrial and sarcolemmal marker enzymes, respectively. present findings confirm previously reported fiber-type specific depression in the initial rate and maximum capacity of ca2+ uptake and altered atpase activity after exercise. depression of the ca2+-stimulated atpase activity of the enzyme was evident after greater than or equal to 20 min of exercise in sr isolated from the deep fibers of these muscles. the lowered atpase activity was followed by a depression in the initial rate of ca2+ uptake in both muscle homogenates and isolated sr fractions after greater than or equal to 45 min of exercise. maximum ca2+ uptake capacity was lower in isolated sr only after exhaustive exercise. ca2+ uptake and ca2+-sensitive atpase activity were not affected at any duration of exercise in sr isolated from superficial fibers of these muscles; however, the mg2+-dependent atpase activity was increased after 45 min and exhaustive exercise bouts. the alterations in sr function could not be attributed to disrupted vesicles or differential contamination in the sr from exercise groups and were reinforced by similar changes in ca2+ uptake in crude muscle homogenates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
@method the modality shift experiment in adults and children with high functioning autism the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
@method gender classification based on support vector machine with automatic confidence in this work, we present a novel approach to face recognition which considers both shape and texture information to represent face images. the face area is first divided into small regions from which local binary pattern (lbp) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single, spatially enhanced feature histogram efficiently representing the face image. the recognition is performed using a nearest neighbour classifier in the computed feature space with chi square as a dissimilarity measure. extensive experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed scheme over all considered methods (pca, bayesian intra/extrapersonal classifier and elastic bunch graph matching) on feret tests which include testing the robustness of the method against different facial expressions, lighting and aging of the subjects. in addition to its efficiency, the simplicity of the proposed method allows for very fast feature extraction.
@background microsporidia-like parasites of amoebae belong to the early fungal lineage rozellomycota free-living amoebae (fla) are distributed ubiquitously in aquatic and humid habitats. in addition to the role of a few species as causative agents of meningoencephalitis and keratitis, fla are frequently considered to serve as natural hosts and vehicles of dierent bacteria ± especially those that cause human illness. these intracellularly growing organisms are thus protected against chlorine ± favoring their distribution within potable water systems and sanitary facilities. this important observation was ®rst mentioned by rowbotham (1986) for legionellae and was shown by in vitro investigations for various bacteria, ®nally sustained by recent ®ndings of burgholderia pickettii (michel et al. 1997), chlamydia-like organisms (amann et al. 1997), pseudomonas aeruginosa (michel et al. 1995a), and ehrlichialike organisms (michel et al. 1995b) multiplying as endocytobiotic organisms within amoebae isolated from natural habitats. recently we isolated an obviously eukaryotic microorganism showing intracellular multiplication within vannella cirrifera amoebae isolated from samples obtained from a domestic potable warm-water system. for proof of the prevalence of fla, 100-ml water samples were ®ltered through membrane ®lters (0.45 lm, nitrocellulose). the ®lters were placed upside down onto nn agar plates according to page (1976) and then incubated at 30 °c. the best growth rates of the parasite and host were observed in cocultures with v. miroides on nn agar supplemented with 1% nonspeci®c ocean salt at 30 °c. growth of the amoebae was investigated daily by light microscopy. for electron microscopy examinations, cultures of 5±8 days were prepared according to techniques described previously (michel et al. 1995b). an infection with intracellular microorganisms could be detected within 2 days of incubation in v. cirrifera trophozoites. the culture of host amoebae and their parasites appeared to be problematic because of a rapid growth of parasites (strain kw19) within their hosts, leading to decay of the amoebic culture. on evaluation of the host range among fla, only one strain of v. miroides appeared sensitive for an infection with the parasite, showing the same characteristics as the wildtype strain, the exception being that the growth of the new host amoebae and their parasites stayed in a better balance, thus enabling continuous culture. phase-contrast microscopy revealed early stages of parasites within the caryoplasm of the host amoeba (fig. 1). the fast-growing parasite expanded the nuclear membrane, ®nally occupying the whole cell after the nuclear membrane had torn. within a period of 3±5 days the infection led to decay of the amoeba, resulting in the release of immobile coccoid stages of the parasite measuring 0.8±1.2 lm in diameter into the environment. electron microscopy examinations showed two different stages of the parasite in the amoebae: (1) the coccoid stage within the cytoplasm of the host cell and (2) the growing polymorphic stages within the caryoplasm (fig. 2). the polymorphous stages in the nucleus grow up to a diameter of 6.5 lm, with intracellular vacuoles and compartments being surrounded by double membranes (fig. 3). at the end of the developmental period the parasite dierentiates into numerous coccoid forms, ®nally occupying the whole host cell. these coccoid stages are provided with a thick wall of low electron density. parasitol res (1998) 84: 164±166 ó springer-verlag 1998
@method the comparative reliability and feasibility of the past-year canadian diet history questionnaire ii: comparison of the paper and web versions multiple-day food records or 24-hour recalls are currently used as "reference" instruments to calibrate food frequency questionnaires (ffqs) and to adjust findings from nutritional epidemiologic studies for measurement error. the common adjustment is based on the critical requirements that errors in the reference instrument be independent of those in the ffq and of true intake. when data on urinary nitrogen level, a valid reference biomarker for nitrogen intake, are used, evidence suggests that a dietary report reference instrument does not meet these requirements. in this paper, the authors introduce a new model that includes, for both the ffq and the dietary report reference instrument, group-specific biases related to true intake and correlated person-specific biases. data were obtained from a dietary assessment validation study carried out among 160 women at the dunn clinical nutrition center, cambridge, united kingdom, in 1988-1990. using the biomarker measurements and dietary report measurements from this study, the authors compare the new model with alternative measurement error models proposed in the literature and demonstrate that it provides the best fit to the data. the new model suggests that, for these data, measurement error in the ffq could lead to a 51% greater attenuation of true nutrient effect and the need for a 2.3 times larger study than would be estimated by the standard approach. the implications of the results for the ability of ffq-based epidemiologic studies to detect important diet-disease associations are discussed.
@background cardioprotective adaptation of rats to intermittent hypobaric hypoxia is accompanied by the increased association of hexokinase with mitochondria. brain hexokinase is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and its activity has been implicated in the regulation of atp synthesis and apoptosis. reactive oxygen species (ros) are by-products of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. here we show that the adp produced by hexokinase activity in rat brain mitochondria (mt-hexokinase) controls both membrane potential (δψm) and ros generation. exposing control mitochondria to glucose increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation. mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity also regulated δψm, because glucose stabilized low δψm values in state 3. interestingly, the addition of glucose 6-phosphate significantly reduced the time of state 3 persistence, leading to an increase in the δψm and in h2o2 generation. the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose completely impaired h2o2 formation in state 3-state 4 transition. in sharp contrast, the mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were, in all the above mentioned experiments, insensitive to glucose addition, indicating that the mt-hexokinase activity is pivotal in the homeostasis of the physiological functions of mitochondria. when mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were incubated with exogenous yeast hexokinase, which is not able to bind to mitochondria, the rate of h2o2 generation reached levels similar to those exhibited by control mitochondria only when an excess of 10-fold more enzyme activity was supplemented. hyperglycemia induced in embryonic rat brain cortical neurons increased ros production due to a rise in the intracellular glucose 6-phosphate levels, which were decreased by the inclusion of 2-deoxyglucose, n-acetyl cysteine, or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. taken together, the results presented here indicate for the first time that mt-hexokinase activity performed a key role as a preventive antioxidant against oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial ros generation through an adp-recycling mechanism.
@background hdm2 antagonist nutlin-3 disrupts p73-hdm2 binding and enhances p73 function mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. recently, small-molecule antagonists of mdm2, the nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-mdm2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. however, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to nutlin treatment. here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (mpnst) and p53-null hct116 cells with cisplatin (cis) and nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. in the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (ls141) and the p53 wild-type hct116 cells, nutlin-3a induced downregulation of e2f1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. in contrast, in mpnst and hctp53−/− cells, nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of e2f1 to mdm2 and induced transcriptional activation of free e2f1 in the presence of cis-induced dna damage. downregulation of e2f1 by small interfering rna significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by cis and nutlin-3a treatment. moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of e2f1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type e2f1 showed an increase in cell death. this correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73α and noxa, which are both regulated by e2f1. these results indicate that antagonism of mdm2 by nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an e2f1-dependent manner. nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.
@method consequences of opioid receptor mutation on actions of univalent and bivalent kappa and delta ligands despite ample pharmacological evidence for the existence of multiple mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes, only three genes encoding mu-(mor), delta-(dor) and kappa-(kor) opioid receptor have been cloned. the kor gene encodes kappa(1)-sites, which specifically bind arylacetamide compounds, and the possible existence of kappa-opioid receptor subtypes derived from another kappa-opioid-receptor gene, yet to be characterized, remains a very contentious issue. kappa(2)-opioid receptors are described as binding sites typically labelled by the non-selective benzomorphan ligand [3h]bremazocine in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor blocking ligands. to investigate the genetic origin of kappa(2)-opioid receptors, we have carried out homogenate binding experiments with [3h]bremazocine in brains of single mor-, dor-, kor- and double mor/dor-deficient mice. scatchard analysis showed that 68+/-12% of the binding sites arise from the mor gene, 27+/-1% from the dor gene and 14.5+/-0.2% from the kor gene, indicating that the three known genes account for total [3h]bremazocine binding. experiments in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor suppressor ligands further showed that non-kappa(1)-opioid receptor labelling can be accounted for by binding to both the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. finally, [3h]bremazocine binding experiments performed on brain membranes from the triple mor/dor/kor-deficient mice revealed a complete absence of binding sites, confirming definitively that no additional gene is required to explain the total population of [3h]bremazocine binding sites. altogether the data show that the putative kappa(2)-opioid receptors are in fact a mixed population of kor, dor and predominantly mor gene products.
@background persistent hypogonadism influences estradiol synthesis, cognition and outcome in males after severe tbi background traumatic brain injury initiates several metabolic processes that can exacerbate the injury. there is evidence that hypothermia may limit some of these deleterious metabolic responses.   methods in a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of moderate hypothermia and normothermia in 82 patients with severe closed head injuries (a score of 3 to 7 on the glasgow coma scale). the patients assigned to hypothermia were cooled to 33 degrees c a mean of 10 hours after injury, kept at 32 degrees to 33 degrees c for 24 hours, and then rewarmed. a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who was unaware of the treatment assignments evaluated the patients 3, 6, and 12 months later with the use of the glasgow outcome scale.   results the demographic characteristics and causes and severity of injury were similar in the hypothermia and normothermia groups. at 12 months, 62 percent of the patients in the hypothermia group and 38 percent of those in the normothermia group had good outcomes (moderate, mild, or no disabilities). the adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome in the hypothermia group was 0.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.2). hypothermia did not improve the outcomes in the patients with coma scores of 3 or 4 on admission. among the patients with scores of 5 to 7, hypothermia was associated with significantly improved outcomes at 3 and 6 months (adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9 at both intervals), although not at 12 months (risk ratio, 0.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.0).   conclusions treatment with moderate hypothermia for 24 hours in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and coma scores of 5 to 7 on admission hastened neurologic recovery and may have improved the outcome.
@background variability in potency among commercial preparations of berberine metabolic regulation is largely dependent on mitochondria, which play an important role in energy homeostasis. imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by a reduced ratio of energy production (atp production) to respiration. due to the role of mitochondrial factors/events in several apoptotic pathways, the possibility of targeting that organelle in the tumor cell, leading to its elimination is very attractive, although the safety issue is problematic. berberine, a benzyl-tetra isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from plants of the berberidaceae family, has been extensively used for many centuries, especially in the traditional chinese and native american medicine. several evidences suggest that berberine possesses several therapeutic uses, including anti-tumoral activity. the present review supplies evidence that berberine is a safe anti-cancer agent, exerting several effects on mitochondria, including inhibition of mitochondrial complex i and interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocator which can explain several of the described effects on tumor cells.
@method use of a β-hcg discriminatory zone with bedside pelvic ultrasonography. the most reliable ultrasonographic criteria for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy are based on the appearance of the uterus in the presence of a positive urine pregnancy test. the absence of an intrauterine sac signifies ectopic pregnancy, whereas its presence indicates intrauterine gestation. these criteria cannot be applied when serum pregnancy tests are used unless the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) level at which the sac of an intrauterine pregnancy becomes visible on ultrasound is known, because these tests are far more sensitive and identify pregnancy at an earlier stage than does sonar. in this study, the hcg level that distinguishes patients with intrauterine pregnancies in whom a gestational sac can be seen from those in whom it cannot be seen was determined and designated the discriminatory hcg zone. this zone lies between 6000 and 6500 mlu/ml. the absence of an intrauterine sac in conjunction with hcg values above this level signifies ectopic pregnancy; however, the absence of an intrauterine sac has no diagnostic significance when associated with hcg values below the discriminatory zone. an intrauterine sac associated with hcg levels above the discriminatory zone reliably indicates an intrauterine pregnancy, but at hcg values below the zone, it is suggestive of an abnormal pregnancy—either a missed abortion or an ectopic gestation.
@method hypothermia and postconditioning after cardiopulmonary resuscitation reduce cardiac dysfunction by modulating inflammation, apoptosis and remodeling volatile anesthetics exert cardioprotective properties in experimental and clinical studies. we designed this study to investigate the effects of sevoflurane on left ventricular (lv) performance during minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (midcab) without cardiopulmonary bypass. fifty-two patients scheduled for midcab surgery were randomly assigned to a propofol or a sevoflurane group. apart from the anesthetics used, there was no difference in surgical and anesthetic management. after determination of cardiac troponin t, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase mb, electrocardiographic (ecg) data and echocardiography variables (myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio) the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) was clamped until anastomosis with the left internal mammary artery was completed. during lad occlusion and during reperfusion, echocardiography measurements were repeated. blood samples were obtained repeatedly for up to 72 h. after lad occlusion, myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio in the propofol group deteriorated significantly from 0.40 ± 0.12 and 1.29 ± 0.35 to 0.49 ± 0.10 and 1.13 ± 0.22, respectively, whereas there was no change in the sevoflurane group. in the propofol group myocardial performance index remained increased (0.47 ± 0.11) compared with baseline during reperfusion. there were no significant differences in ecg and laboratory values between groups. in conclusion, during a brief period of ischemia in patients undergoing midcab surgery, sevoflurane preserved myocardial function better than propofol.
@method characterization of the antimicrobial peptide family defensins in the tasmanian devil (sarcophilus harrisii), koala (phascolarctos cinereus), and tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii) backgroundthe thymus plays a critical role in the development and maturation of t-cells. humans have a single thoracic thymus and presence of a second thymus is considered an anomaly. however, many vertebrates have multiple thymuses. the tammar wallaby has two thymuses: a thoracic thymus (typically found in all mammals) and a dominant cervical thymus. researchers have known about the presence of the two wallaby thymuses since the 1800s, but no genome-wide research has been carried out into possible functional differences between the two thymic tissues. here, we used pyrosequencing to compare the transcriptomes of a cervical and thoracic thymus from a single 178 day old tammar wallaby.resultswe show that both the tammar thoracic and the cervical thymuses displayed gene expression profiles consistent with roles in t-cell development. both thymuses expressed genes that mediate distinct phases of t-cells differentiation, including the initial commitment of blood stem cells to the t-lineage, the generation of t-cell receptor diversity and development of thymic epithelial cells. crucial immune genes, such as chemokines were also present. comparable patterns of expression of non-coding rnas were seen. 67 genes differentially expressed between the two thymuses were detected, and the possible significance of these results are discussed.conclusionthis is the first study comparing the transcriptomes of two thymuses from a single individual. our finding supports that both thymuses are functionally equivalent and drive t-cell development. these results are an important first step in the understanding of the genetic processes that govern marsupial immunity, and also allow us to begin to trace the evolution of the mammalian immune system.
@background photosynthetic co2 affinity of the aquatic carnivorous plant utricularia australis (lentibulariaceae) and its investment in carnivory various ecophysiological investigations are presented in aldrovanda vesiculosa, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant. a distinct polarity of n, p, and ca tissue content per dry mass (dm) unit was found along aldrovanda shoots. due to effective re-utilization, relatively small proportions of n (10 – 13 %) and p (33 – 43 %) are probably lost with senescent leaf whorls, while there is complete loss of all ca, k, and mg. the total content of starch and free sugars was 26 – 47 % dm along adult shoots, with the maximum in the 7th – 10th whorls. about 30 % of the total maximum sugar content was probably lost with dead whorls. the plant was found to take up 5 – 7 times more nh4+ to no3− from a mineral medium. under nearly-natural conditions in an outdoor cultivation container, catching of prey led to significantly more rapid growth than in unfed plants. dm of the fed controls was 48 % higher than in the unfed plants. the controls produced 0.69 branches per plant, while the unfed plants did not produced any. however, the n and p content per dm unit increased by 6 – 25 % in the apices and the first 6 whorls in the unfed variant, as compared to the fed controls. it may be suggested that carnivory is very important for aldrovanda.
@background intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes following selective blockade or stimulation of the pge2 ep1 receptor reactive astrocytes adjacent to a forebrain stab injury were selectively ablated in adult mice expressing hsv-tk from the gfap promoter by treatment with ganciclovir. injured tissue that was depleted of gfap-positive astrocytes exhibited (1) a prolonged 25-fold increase in infiltration of cd45-positive leukocytes, including ultrastructurally identified monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, (2) failure of blood-brain barrier (bbb) repair, (3) substantial neuronal degeneration that could be attenuated by chronic glutamate receptor blockade, and (4) a pronounced increase in local neurite outgrowth. these findings show that genetic targeting can be used to ablate scar-forming astrocytes and demonstrate roles for astrocytes in regulating leukocyte trafficking, repairing the bbb, protecting neurons, and restricting nerve fiber growth after injury in the adult central nervous system.
@method the plasma membrane of the cyanobacterium gloeobacter violaceus contains segregated bioenergetic domains[c][w] kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. the major component of kegg is the pathway database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. the pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. kegg maintains the genes database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the ligand database for chemical compounds and enzymes. each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by java applet. in addition to the data collection efforts, kegg develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. the kegg databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
@result autoimmune hemolytic anemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: analysis of 533 adult patients who underwent transplantation at king's college hospital. we reviewed the medical records of 293 patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplants at the hammersmith hospital between 1989 and 1994. there was clinical evidence of an autoimmune reaction against red cells in nine patients. seven of these patients had significant haemolysis; the other two had red cell auto-agglutination. haemolysis was resistant to treatment in three cases. six of the nine patients had monoclonal ig bands identified within 1 year of transplant. the autoimmune reaction could be classified broadly into two types: an early onset type (n = 4) beginning 2 to 8 months post-transplant associated with a cold antibody, and a late onset type (n = 5) beginning 6 to 18 months post-transplant associated with warm antibodies. the predominant antibody in the two categories described may reflect the kinetics of immune reconstitution post-transplant, since serum igm levels typically return to normal 2 to 6 months post-transplant, while igg levels may not reach normal levels until 12–18 months post-transplant. we speculate that unbalanced reconstitution of b and t cell lymphopoiesis post-transplant may favour emergence of oligoclonal proliferation and that some of the resulting antibodies may have activity against red cells.
@method the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
@method validation of quantitative measures of rotatory knee laxity purposealthough various kinematic measurements with advanced technology have been used for quantitative evaluation of the pivot shift test, there is no clinically available quantification method of the pivot shift test. the purpose was to describe a novel image analysis technique for quantitative assessment of the pivot shift test using universally available and affordable devices.methodsfive acl deficient knees were tested during examination under anesthesia. three skin markers were attached to bony landmarks on the lateral side of the knee joint, (1) gerdy’s tubercle, (2) fibular head, and (3) lateral epicondyle. a standard digital video camera captured motion of the lateral aspect of the knee during the pivot shift test. the image was processed into a 2-dimensional (2-d) coordinate system with image j software (national institute of health, usa) to trace the three landmarks. the anteroposterior (ap) position of the femur was calculated on consecutive still images extracted from the video recording. ap translation over time was reported.resultsthe reduction phase of the pivot shift could be tracked consistently by a sudden anterior translation of the distal femur. the sudden anterior translation of the lateral epicondyle was on average 3.7 ± 2.1 mm and occurred within 0.2 ± 0.1 s from the start of this anterior translation till the end.conclusionthe sudden shift of the lateral compartment of the knee joint was successfully detected by this newly developed image analysis measurement method. this image analysis technique facilitates a simple and affordable method to evaluate the lateral pivot shift test.level of evidencediagnostic studies, level iv.
@background vigorous exercise increases brain lactate and glx (glutamate+glutamine): a dynamic 1h-mrs study coupling between cerebral blood flow (cbf) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (cmro2) was studied using multiple sequential administrations of 15o-labeled radiotracers (half-life, 123 sec) and positron emission tomography. in the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between cbf and cmro2 was found when paired measurements of cbf and cmro2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. regional uncoupling of cbf and cmro2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of cbf-cmro2 uncoupling observed. dynamic, physiological regulation of cbf by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.
@method cross-lingual dependency transfer : what matters? assessing the impact of pre- and post-processing most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. we present a transition-based system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective trees. experimental evaluation on chinese, czech, english and german shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-the-art results for all languages.
@background altered caudate connectivity is associated with executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury individual differences in striatal dopamine (da) signaling have been associated both with individual differences in executive function in healthy individuals and with risk for psychiatric disorders defined by executive dysfunction. we used resting-state functional connectivity in 50 healthy adults to examine whether a polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene (dat1), which regulates striatal da function, affects striatal functional connectivity in healthy adults, and whether that connectivity predicts executive function. we found that 9/10 heterozygotes, who are believed to have higher striatal da signaling, demonstrated stronger connectivity between dorsal caudate (dc) and insular, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as between ventral striatum and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, than 10/10 homozygotes. across subjects, stronger dc-seeded connectivity predicted superior n-back working memory performance, while stronger ventral striatum-seeded connectivity predicted reduced impulsivity in everyday life. further, mediation analysis suggested that connectivity strength mediated relationships between dat1 genotype and behavior. these findings suggest that resting-state striato-frontal connectivity may be an endophenotype for executive function in healthy individuals.
@background diesel exhaust particles induce oxidative stress, proinflammatory signaling, and p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation at the blood‐brain barrier epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between short term exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm) and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. although the biological mechanisms of these adverse effects are unknown, emerging data suggest a key role for oxidative stress. ambient pm and diesel exhaust particles (dep) contain redox cycling organic chemicals that induce pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects in the lung. these responses are suppressed by n-acetylcysteine (nac), which directly complexes to electrophilic dep chemicals and exert additional antioxidant effects at the cellular level. a proteomics approach was used to study dep-induced responses in the macrophage cell line, raw 264.7. we demonstrate that in the dose range 10–100 μg/ml, organic dep extracts induce a progressive decline in the cellular gsh/gssg ratio, in parallel with a linear increase in newly expressed proteins on the two-dimensional gel. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, 32 newly induced/nac-suppressed proteins were identified. these include antioxidant enzymes (e.g. heme oxygenase-1 and catalase), pro-inflammatory components (e.g. p38mapk and rel a), and products of intermediary metabolism that are regulated by oxidative stress. heme oxygenase-1 was induced at low extract dose and with minimal decline in the gsh/gssg ratio, whereas map kinase activation required a higher chemical dose and incremental levels of oxidative stress. moreover, at extract doses >50 μg/ml, there is a steep decline in cellular viability. these data suggest that dep induce a hierarchical oxidative stress response in which some of these proteins may serve as markers for oxidative stress during pm exposures.
@background comparing the efficacy of intrauterine lidocaine and paracervical block in decreasing the pain associated with endometrial biopsy: a randomised trial objective to compare becteriostatic saline and buffered lidocaine for cervical anesthesia to blunt the reported pain during brief suction curettage. methods a double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures. participants received either paracervical submucosal injections of bacteriostatic saline or 1% buffered lidocaine just before cervical dilation. self-reported pain intensity was assessed at three time points during and 30 minutes after the procedure. results fifty-two of 135 eligible women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures participated in the study. pain intensity ratings in lidocaine and saline treatment subjects did not differ significantly at any point. our study had a power of .094 to detect more than a 15% difference on the 21-point box scale between the two solutions. only one patient requested her block be repeated, and she had received lidocaine originally. furthermore, of those women receiving lidocaine, 11% reported mild toxicity symptoms. conclusion to minimize lidocaine toxicity for a brief suction curettage procedure, bacteriostatic saline or very dilute lidocaine could be considered for the paracervical injection rather than blockage of specific autonomic nerves when there is no waiting period. this would mean that the term paracervical block could be changed to cervical anesthesia.
@background long-term outcome of displaced, transverse, noncomminuted olecranon fractures thirty-seven consecutive olecranon fractures treated with tension-band wiring were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 4 years. there was no or mild pain in 33 cases, mean elbow extension was 7 degrees , and mean elbow flexion was 131 degrees . according to the mayo elbow performance score, the results were graded as good or excellent in 32 cases (86%). most patients had mild residual upper extremity disability (mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score, 18 points). in 10 patients, degenerative changes developed. arthritic changes were significantly associated with elbow instability (p = .014) and length of follow-up (p = .031) and were more common in the presence of associated radial head or coronoid fractures (p = .06). hardware removal was required in 17 cases. tension-band wiring provides satisfactory results in a high percentage of olecranon fractures. however, the outcome may be compromised in the presence of elbow instability and associated fractures of the radial head and coronoid.
@result lymphatic involvement in the disappearance of steroidogenic cells from the corpus luteum during luteolysis abstract corpora lutea removed at various times during the estrous cycle were studied after no treatment, treatment with oxytocin, oxytocin and hcg, oxytocin and bovine lh, and with hcg alone. these studies supported a hypothesis that luteal cells are derived from both granulosa and theca interna layers of the follicle. the granulosa-derived luteal cells develop into functioning luteal cells by about day 4 of the estrous cycle, after which they undergo no further divisions. therefore, granulosa-derived cells have limited potential. however, the smaller luteal cells derived from the theca interna respond to plasma luteotropin, multiply and grow into large luteal cells. these are mainly responsible for growth of the corpus luteum following day 4. there was luteinization of the theca interna and granulosa layers of the follicles shortly before ovulation and in anovulatory (cystic) follicles. the collapse of the follicle and growth of the corpus luteum were described, with special emphasis on the patterns of mitotic activity before and after stimulation with exogenous luteotropin and on progesterone concentrations and contents. growth and degeneration of a luteal cell were described.
@background contour changes after guided bone regeneration of large non-contained mandibular buccal bone defects using deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a porcine-derived collagen membrane: an experimental in vivo investigation objectives to test whether or not vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue grafts are as successful as free subepithelial connective tissue grafts in augmenting volume defects in the anterior maxilla.   material and methods twenty subjects with seibert class 1 ridge defects in the anterior maxilla were randomly, equally assigned to augmentation by vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue graft (test) or free subepithelial connective tissue graft (control). clinical periodontal parameters at teeth adjacent to the gap were recorded, and conventional impressions were taken prior to surgery (baseline = t(0)) and 1 (t(1)), 3 (t(3)) and 6 (t(6)) months after surgery. the casts were optically scanned, digitized and analyzed for ridge contour changes in the augmented area. data were subjected to nonparametric statistics.   results the contour changes in labial distance between baseline and follow-up for the control group were (median, range) 1 mm, 0.37-1.45 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.18 mm, 0.39-1.40 (t(0)-t(3)); and 0.63 mm, 0.28-1.22 (t(0)-t(6)) and for test group 1.21 mm, 0.74-2.47 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.26 mm, 0.50-1.71 (t(0)-t(3)); and 1.18 mm, 0.16-1.75 (t(0)-t(6)). significantly less shrinkage of the graft was observed in the test group after 6 months (p = 0.03). clinical periodontal parameters at the neighboring teeth were stable over the follow-up period and did not differ between groups.   conclusions augmentation of single tooth gaps with moderate ridge defects in the anterior maxilla was successfully performed using both techniques. however, after 6 months, sites treated by the pediculated graft were superior in maintaining the initially augmented volume and showed less shrinkage of the graft. this could be attributed to better perfusion of the pediculated graft.
@background mutations in non-small cell lung cancer p 53 frequency of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking increase the updated consumption of alcoholic beverages is an accepted social custom world-wide. this makes its involvement in events contributing to human cancer risk very important. although it is neither tumorigenic nor genotoxic in animals, ethanol can potentiate the carcinogenic risk associated with certain environmentally present agents. the reasons for such a synergistic action are speculative, but among theories postulated may be ethanol's ability to modify the toxicokinetics/dynamics of carcinogen metabolism. experiments conducted with rodents and primates support this hypothesis, demonstrating increased exposure of posthepatic organs to nitrosamines when given in combination with ethanol, followed by enhancement of dna adduct formation and, at least in rodents, of tumor development. in addition, ethanol may induce enzymes responsible for carcinogen activation, including hepatic cytochrome p450 2e1 in rodents and humans, and in lung, kidney, and brain in rodents. studies have also shown that these effects can extend to the next generation via maternal and in utero fetal exposure. what impact such ethanol-induced modulations have on tumorigenesis during childhood and later stages of life needs to be investigated further.
@result sortilin expression is essential for pro-nerve growth factor-induced apoptosis of rat vascular smooth muscle cells neurotrophins are growth factors that promote cell survival, differentiation, and cell death. they are synthesized as proforms that can be cleaved intracellularly to release mature, secreted ligands. although proneurotrophins have been considered inactive precursors, we show here that the proforms of nerve growth factor (ngf) and the proforms of brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) are secreted and cleaved extracellularly by the serine protease plasmin and by selective matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). prongf is a high-affinity ligand for p75ntr with high affinity and induced p75ntr-dependent apoptosis in cultured neurons with minimal activation of trka-mediated differentiation or survival. the biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75ntr to mediate apoptosis and mature forms activating trk receptors to promote survival.
@background retraction for dougan et al., probing osmolyte participation in the unfolding transition state of a protein osmolytes are small organic compounds that affect protein stability and are ubiquitous in living systems. in the equilibrium protein folding reaction, unfolded (u) ⇌ native (n), protecting osmolytes push the equilibrium toward n, whereas denaturing osmolytes push the equilibrium toward u. as yet, there is no universal molecular theory that can explain the mechanism by which osmolytes interact with the protein to affect protein stability. here, we lay the groundwork for such a theory, starting with a key observation: the transfer free energy of protein backbone from water to a water/osmolyte solution, δgtr, is negatively correlated with an osmolyte’s fractional polar surface area. δgtr measures the degree to which an osmolyte stabilizes a protein. consequently, a straightforward interpretation of this correlation implies that the interaction between the protein backbone and osmolyte polar groups is more favorable than the corresponding interaction with nonpolar groups. such an interpretation immediately suggests the existence of a universal mechanism involving osmolyte, backbone, and water. we test this idea by using it to construct a quantitative solvation model in which backbone/solvent interaction energy is a function of interactant polarity, and the number of energetically equivalent ways of realizing a given interaction is a function of interactant surface area. using this model, calculated δgtr values show a strong correlation with measured values (r = 0.99). in addition, the model correctly predicts that protecting/denaturing osmolytes will be preferentially excluded/accumulated around the protein backbone. taken together, these model-based results rationalize the dominant interactions observed in experimental studies of osmolyte-induced protein stabilization and denaturation.
@background glucose is a ph-dependent motor for sperm beat frequency during early activation mammalian spermatozoa expend energy, generated as intracellular atp, largely on motility. if the sperm cell cannot swim by use of its flagellar motion, it cannot fertilize the egg. studies of the means by which this energy is generated span a period of six decades. this review gives an overview of these studies, which demonstrate that both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, for which oxygen is friend, and glycolysis, for which sugar is friend, can provide the energy, independent of one another. in mouse sperm, glycolysis appears to be the dominant pathway; in bull sperm, oxidative phosphorylation is the predominant pathway. in the case of bull sperm, the high activity of the glycolytic pathway would maintain the intracellular ph too low to allow sperm capacitation; here sugar is enemy. the cow's oviduct has very low glucose concentration, thus allowing capacitation to go forward. the choice of the pathway of energy generation in vivo is set by the conditions in the oviduct of the conspecific female. the phospholipids of the sperm plasma membrane have a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids represented in their acyl moieties, rendering them highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; in this case oxygen is enemy. but the susceptibility of the sperm membrane to lethal damage by lipid peroxidation allows the female oviduct to dispose of sperm that have overstayed their welcome, and so keep in balance sperm access to the egg and sperm removal once this has occurred.
@background contemporary fatherhood and its consequences for paternal psychological well-being – a cross-sectional study of fathers in central europe objective the prevalence and etiology of pre- and postpartum depressive symptoms in women in a variety of family forms have been well documented, but relatively little research has been conducted on the adjustment of their male partners. the authors' goals in this study were 1) to estimate rates of depression during the pregnancy and 8 weeks following the birth of a child in a large representative community sample of fathers in different family structures and 2) to explore the role of stressful life events, social and emotional support, the quality of the partner relationship, and socioeconomic circumstances.   method this study describes the relations of family setting and other correlates to men's depressive symptoms during the pregnancies (18 weeks gestation, on average) and 8 weeks after the births of children for 7,018 partners of female participants in the avon longitudinal study of pregnancy and childhood.   results men living in stepfamilies had-significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms before and after the birth than did men in more traditional families. the effect of stepfamily status on depression was mediated by education, life events, social support, social network, and level of aggression in the partnership.   conclusions there are similarities in the patterns and correlates of depression after the birth of a child for men and women. these findings point to the importance of family and partnership ecology in the adjustment of men before and after the birth of a child.
@method heavy metal ions are potent inhibitors of protein folding. the molecular chaperone proteins, particularly hsp60 and hsp70, have been implicated in essential cell functions under both normal and stress conditions (reviewed in refs 15). members of the family of heat-shock proteins ofm r70k, hsp70, bind to unfolded proteins and short peptides613. addition of mgatp results in the dissociation of the substrate polypeptides from the chaperone711, but as atp-γs (an atp analogue that is only slowly hydrolysable) cannot substitute for atp in this reaction7,9,11, it has been concluded that atp hydrolysis is necessary to dissociate hsp70substrate protein complexes. by independently measuring the rates of atp hydrolysis and substrate protein dissociation, we show here that mgatp binding but not mgatp hydrolysis is essential for substrate dissociation. we also show that there is an absolute requirement for k+for the effect of mgatp: only the combination of k+ and mgatp will cause the conformational change in hspto that is necessary for substrate dissociation. moreover, in the absence of k+, mgatp favours complex formation. we consider these results in terms of a g-protein-like model.
@background lower galactosylation levels of the lipophosphoglycan from leishmania (leishmania) major-like strains affect interaction with phlebotomus papatasi and lutzomyia longipalpis lipophosphoglycan (lpg) is an abundant surface molecule that plays key roles in the infectious cycle ofleishmania major. the dominant feature of lpg is a polymer of phosphoglycan (pg) (6galβ1,4manα1-po4) repeating units. in l. major these are extensively substituted with gal(β1,3) side chains, which are required for binding to midgut lectins and survival. we utilized evolutionary polymorphisms in lpg structure and cross-species transfections to recover genes encoding the lpg side chain β1,3-galactosyltransferases (βgalts). a dispersed family of six scg genes was recovered, whose predicted proteins exhibited characteristics of eukaryotic galts. at least four of these proteins showed significant lpg side chain βgalt activity; scg3 exhibited initiating galt activity whereas scg2 showed both initiating and elongating galt activity. however, the activity ofscg2 was context-dependent, being largely silent in its normal genomic milieu, and different strains show considerable variation in the extent of lpg galactosylation. thus thel. major genome encodes a family of scgs with varying specificity and activity, and we propose that strain-specific lpg galactosylation patterns reflect differences in their expression.
@method current concepts in the pathophysiology and management of arteriovenous access-induced hand ischemia. unlabelled the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the vcs vascular clip approximating system for the creation of hemodialysis access fistulas. 173 new vascular accesses were created, 92 prosthetic grafts and 81 autologous fistulas over a 40-month period. 50 sutured and 42 clipped fistulas comprised the prosthetic graft series, and 33 sutured and 48 clipped cases the autologous series. risk factors associated with access patency were correlated and the primary patencies compared in the suture versus clipped group. a significant improvement in primary patency was noted for the clipped prosthetic group at all time points studied, with a positive trend also noted for clipped autologous fistulae.   conclusions the vascular clipping system (the vcs system) provides both long-term and immediate advantages for vascular access construction. clips have been used successfully to treat seven consecutive patients with upper extremity arterial steal syndrome without the technical difficulties associated with traditional methods of repair.
@background the arabidopsis pxa 1 mutant is defective in an atp-binding cassette transporter-like protein required for peroxisomal fatty acid-oxidation 1 the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (aldp) is an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter in the human peroxisome membrane. it is defective in x chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ald), a neurodegenerative disorder with impaired peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. we report cloning and characterization of pxa1, a yeast gene encoding a protein (pxa1p) exhibiting high similarity to aldp. disruption of pxa1 results in impaired growth on oleic acid and reduced ability to oxidize oleate. pxa1p is peroxisome associated; however, in the pxa1 mutant yeast, as in ald cells, peroxisomes are morphologically intact. disruption of a second yeast gene, ykl741, which encodes a more distantly related aldp homolog (yk174p), in either wild-type or pxa1 mutant yeast, results in a growth phenotype identical to that of the pxa1 mutant. this result suggests that yk1741p and pxa1p may be subunits of the same transporter. sequence analysis of pxa1p, aldp, and related abc transporters reveals a possible fatty acid binding domain and a 14-amino acid eaa-like motif, previously described only in prokaryotes. because of the similarities in sequence and function, we propose that pxa1p is the saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of aldp.
@method the regulatory effect of mirnas is a heritable genetic trait in humans backgroundover the last few years, genome-wide association (gwa) studies became a tool of choice for the identification of loci associated with complex traits. currently, imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) data are frequently used in gwa analyzes. correct analysis of imputed data calls for the implementation of specific methods which take genotype imputation uncertainty into account.resultswe developed the probabel software package for the analysis of genome-wide imputed snp data and quantitative, binary, and time-till-event outcomes under linear, logistic, and cox proportional hazards models, respectively. for quantitative traits, the package also implements a fast two-step mixed model-based score test for association in samples with differential relationships, facilitating analysis in family-based studies, studies performed in human genetically isolated populations and outbred animal populations.conclusionsprobabel package provides fast efficient way to analyze imputed data in genome-wide context and will facilitate future identification of complex trait loci.
@result sf-1 expression in the hypothalamus is required for beneficial metabolic effects of exercise phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k) signaling in the hypothalamus has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, but the critical brain sites where this intracellular signal integrates various metabolic cues to regulate food intake and energy expenditure are unknown. here, we show that mice with reduced pi3k activity in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh) are more sensitive to high-fat diet-induced obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. in addition, inhibition of pi3k in the vmh impaired the ability to alter energy expenditure in response to acute high-fat diet feeding and food deprivation. furthermore, the acute anorexigenic effects induced by exogenous leptin were blunted in the mutant mice. collectively, our results indicate that pi3k activity in vmh neurons plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of energy expenditure.
@method mortality, severe acute respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness associated with influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 in argentina, 2009 we applied a reverse transcription (rt)-pcr assay for influenza a virus to combined nasal wash-throat swab specimens previously obtained from an outpatient pediatric population with acute respiratory illness during concurrent epidemics of influenza a virus and respiratory syncytial virus. the results of the rt-pcr assay were compared with those previously reported with virus cultivation and commercially available rapid diagnostic kits (e.a. dominguez, l.h. taber, and r.b. couch, j. clin. microbiol. 31:2286-2290, 1993). with virus cultivation as the "gold standard", the rt-pcr assay had a sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of 95, 98, and 97%, respectively, compared with 75, 100, and 93%, respectively, for the best diagnostic kit (becton dickinson directigen). rt-pcr is an effective alternative to virus isolation for the detection of influenza a virus in clinical specimens.
@background vermicomposting of vegetable market waste using perionyx ceylanensis recycling of guar gum industrial waste through vermitechnology was studied under laboratory conditions by using composting earthworm perionyx excavatus (perrier). three different combination of guar gum industrial waste namely guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 40:30:30 ratio (t1), guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 60:20:20 ratio (t2), and guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 75:15:10 ratio (t3) were used for vermicomposting experiments. chemical changes during vermicomposting were measured and comparatively t2 showed great increase (from its initial level) for total n (25.4%), phosphorus (72.8%) and potassium (20.9%) than the other treatments. t2 also showed higher vermicomposting coefficient (vc), higher mean biomass for p. excavatus (146.68 mg) and higher cocoon production (about 21.9% and 645.5% more than the t1 and t3, respectively). maximum earthworm mortality during vermicomposting was recorded with t3 treatment while zero mortality was recorded for t2 treatment after 150 days. overall, t2 treatment appeared to be an ideal combination for enhancing maximum biopotential of earthworms to management guar gum industrial waste as well as for earthworm biomass and cocoon production.
@result fas activation increases neural progenitor cell survival the potential of pluripotent embryonic stem (es) cells to develop into functional cells or tissue provides an opportunity in the development of new therapies for many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. the survival of implanted cells usually requires systemic immunosuppression, however, which severely compromises the host immune system, leading to complications in clinical transplantation. an optimal therapy would therefore be the induction of specific tolerance to the donor cells, while otherwise preserving functional immune responses. fas ligand (fasl) is expressed in activated lymphocytes as well as cells in “immune‐privileged” sites including the central nervous system. its receptor, fas, is expressed on various immune‐reactive cell types, such as activated natural killer and t cells, monocytes, and polymorphic mononucleocytes, which can undergo apoptosis upon interaction with fasl. to render transplanted cells tolerant to host cellular immune responses, we genetically engineered mouse es cells to express rat fasl (rfasl). the rfasl‐expressing es cells were analyzed for survival during in vitro neurodifferentiation and after transplantation to the rat brain without further immunosuppression. although control transfected hek‐293t cells expressed functional rfasl, immature and differentiated mouse es cells did not express the recombinant rfasl surface protein. furthermore, there was no evidence for functional endogenous fas and fasl expression on either es cells or on neural cells after in vitro differentiation. moreover, implanted rfasl‐engineered es cells did not survive in the rat brains in the absence of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine a. our results indicate that immature and differentiated mouse es cells do not express a functional fas/fasl system.

@method structure-function relationship and evolutionary history of the human selenoprotein m (selm) found over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. selenoproteins contain the trace element selenium incorporated as selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid. some members of the selenoprotein family, such as the glutathione peroxidases, have well-characterized antioxidant activity, functioning in enzymatic breakdown of hydroperoxides to protect cells against oxidative stress. however, the functions of many of the 25 human selenoproteins, including the brain-enriched selenoprotein m, are unknown. we investigated selenoprotein m function by manipulating expression in murine hippocampal ht22 cells, cerebellar astrocyte c8-d1a cells, and primary neuronal cultures. overexpression of the protein resulted in a reduction in reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative challenge with hydrogen peroxide. in contrast, knock-down of selenoprotein m using shrna in primary neuronal cultures caused apoptotic cell death comparable to levels resulting from addition of hydrogen peroxide. calcium measurements with the indicator cameleon demonstrated that overexpression of selenoprotein m decreased calcium influx in response to hydrogen peroxide. additionally, knock-down of selenoprotein m expression in cortical cultures caused higher baseline levels of cytosolic calcium than in control cells. these results suggest that selenoprotein m may have an important role in protecting against oxidative damage in the brain and may potentially function in calcium regulation.
@background tako-tsubo syndrome: an important differential diagnosis in patients with acute chest pain key summary points the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome is a novel cardiac syndrome. it is characterized by peculiar transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle, which is the result of characteristic wall-motion abnormalities in the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle. despite the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, clinical presentation in patients with the syndrome is similar to that of patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction. postmenopausal women seem to be most at risk for developing the syndrome. an episode of acute emotional or physiologic stress seems to often precede presentation with the syndrome. patients with the syndrome should be monitored and treated for left heart failure, dynamic intraventricular obstruction, arrhythmias, and mechanical complications, should they develop. patients with the syndrome seem to have a favorable in-hospital prognosis despite the development of acute left-sided heart failure and hemodynamic instability in many patients. the cause of the syndrome is not yet known. the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a recently described novel acute cardiac syndrome. the syndrome is characterized by peculiar, yet characteristic, transient regional systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular segments. the syndrome was initially recognized and reported in the japanese population (1-6). dote and colleagues (1) were one of the first to describe the syndrome, which was given the moniker tako-tsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction, naming it after a round-bottomed narrow-necked japanese fishing pot used for trapping octopus (figure 1, parts a, b, and c). more recently, the condition has been called transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in reference to the associated left ventricular morphologic features that accompany the syndrome. after the initial recognition and description of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in the japanese population, subsequent recent reports have documented the syndrome in the united states (7) and belgium (8). despite the acute onset of transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle, patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome do not have obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease. the cause of the syndrome is unknown. figure 1. left ventriculograms (end-systole) of 2 patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome and examples of a tako-tsubo. a. b c d e d e american heart journal available case series of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome have included relatively few patients. this review presents reported case series of the syndrome in order to more precisely summarize the demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients presenting with the syndrome. in addition, we review the available literature evaluating possible pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the syndrome. methods literature search and identification of relevant studies we identified relevant english-language articles pertaining to the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome by searching the pubmed and embase databases (through june 2004). the following search terms were used to identify primary articles: left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, ampulla cardiomyopathy, and transient left ventricular dysfunction. we then manually searched references from the primary articles. we included only peer-reviewed reports and did not search for unpublished data. when more than 1 case series was reported from the same medical center, we included the case series reporting on the largest number of patients and excluded those with fewer patients to avoid duplicate reporting. only case series reporting on at least 5 consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were initially identified and assessed for potential inclusion in this case series review. case reports and small case series reporting on fewer than 5 patients were not included in the review in an attempt to minimize potential reporting bias of uncharacteristic or nonrepresentative cases. we included prospective and retrospective case series. figure 2 outlines the search and selection process. figure 2. study identification. case series and data assessment we identified 13 case series for potential inclusion in this review. of these, 10 reported on unselected, consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. seven of these 10 case series reported on patients who met the following criteria and were subsequently included in this review. first, the patient must have had transient apical and midleft ventricular wall-motion abnormalities resulting in the left ventricular morphologic appearance of apical ballooning. second, coronary angiography data that excluded obstructive atherothrombotic coronary artery disease as the causative mechanism for left ventricular dysfunction had to be available. third, the study had to report on patient demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic characteristics, laboratory data, cardiac catheterization data, clinical complications, and clinical outcome. of the 3 excluded series reporting on consecutive patients, 2 were excluded because they lacked coronary angiography data for all patients (9, 10), and 1 was excluded because it reported on only 2 patients (11). in addition, data that addressed potential pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were identified by using the search strategy described earlier. these data were then reviewed and summarized. one author read and assessed all studies. results table 1 summarizes the 7 case series that met the inclusion criteria for this review. of these, 5 reports were from japan (2-6), 1 was from the united states (7), and 1 was from belgium (8). three studies reported prospectively collected data, 2 studies reported retrospective data, and 2 studies did not specify the prospective or retrospective nature of the study. table 1. demographic and clinical characteristics of consecutive patients given a diagnosis of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome demographic characteristics and presenting symptoms all 7 case series consistently reported a sex discrepancy in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome: most patients were women (range, 82% to 100%). the mean age of patients presenting with the syndrome was 62 to 75 years (overall range, 10 to 88 years). patients often presented with chest pain at rest (33% to 71%), although dyspnea as the initial symptom was not uncommon. isolated cases of syncope as the presenting symptom have been reported (2, 4, 5, 7). electrocardiographic data the most common finding on the admission electrocardiogram was st-segment elevation (range, 46% to 100% of patients). all series except 1 reported st-segment elevation in at least 81% of patients. st-segment elevation, when present, was most often reported in the precordial leads. concomitant st-segment elevation in the inferior leads has been reported in a few cases, and isolated inferior or lateral st-segment elevation seems to be an unusual electrocardiographic finding in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. new left and right bundle-branch block on the presenting electrocardiogram has been reported. almost all series patients developed evolutionary t-wave inversions that were usually present in most leads. new pathologic q waves on the electrocardiogram were reported in 6% to 31% of patients; in some instances, the q waves were transient. the corrected qt interval on the presenting electrocardiogram was prolonged; it ranged from a mean of 450 milliseconds to 501 milliseconds. cardiac enzyme and biomarker release most patients had a small, rapid increase in cardiac enzyme and biomarker levels. fifty-six percent to 100% of patients had a peak cardiac enzyme or biomarker level above the upper limit of normal. the series reporting a 56% incidence of cardiac enzyme increase assessed only creatine kinase (3), whereas the 2 series reporting a 100% incidence of biomarker release evaluated cardiac troponin (7, 8). several series have reported that peak cardiac biomarker levels are often those drawn at the time of initial presentation; they appear to not follow the slow rise-and- fall kinetics observed with conventional myocardial infarction. angiographic data and left ventricular function patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome had either no angiographically detectable coronary disease (range, 25% to 100% of patients) or nonobstructive coronary disease (range, 0% to 75% of patients). none of the patients had epicardial stenosis greater than 50% of the luminal coronary artery diameter. patients with the syndrome had an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation (mean, 0.39 to 0.49) that improved rapidly over a period of days to weeks (mean follow-up left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.60 to 0.76). apical and mid-ventricular regional wall-motion abnormalities completely resolved in most patients and followed a time course similar to that of the associated improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. four studies reported endomyocardial biopsy results in the acute phase of the syndrome (n= 18), with no evidence of myocarditis (2, 4-6). evaluations of endothelial function and coronary microcirculation either spontaneous or provocable multivessel epicardial spasm was present in a few patients; the incidence of provoca
@method room for improvement in nutrition knowledge and dietary intake of male football (soccer) players in australia. nutrition knowledge is believed to influence nutritional intake, which in turn influences performance in elite athletes. there is currently no published data on the nutrition knowledge of elite australian football (af) players. the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the current level of general and sports nutrition knowledge in elite male af athletes. forty six elite male af players (23.5 ± 2.8 years) answered 123 questions relating to five areas of nutrition knowledge: dietary recommendations, sources of nutrients, choosing everyday foods, alcohol and sports nutrition. demographic details and perceptions of nutrition knowledge were collected for all participants. the mean nutrition knowledge score was 74.4 ± 10.9 (60.5%). the highest score was obtained in sports nutrition section (17.9 ± 3.0, 61.7%). the dietitian was selected as the first source of information by 98% of athletes, with club trainer and teammates as second choice for 45.7% and 23.9% of athletes, respectively. the majority of athletes correctly answered questions regarding recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake and decrease fat intake (95.6%, 91.1% and 93.3% correct respectively). while 80% of the athletes were aware fat intake should predominately be made up of unsaturated fat, they were less able to identify food sources of unsaturated fats (35.6% and 24.4% correct for statements regarding monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, respectively). broad nutrition messages and recommendations appear to be well understood; however, gaps in nutrition knowledge are evident. a better understanding of nutrition knowledge in athletes will allow nutrition education interventions to target areas in need of improvement.
@result sex determination using humeral dimensions in a sample from kwazulu-natal: an osteometric study determination of sex from the skeleton is vital to medicolegal investigations. there is no longer any question that populations differ in size and proportions and these differences affect the metric assessment of sex. the extent of variation in sexual dimorphism among asian mongoloids within and between regions has not been quantified by discriminant function analysis, nor have standards for most groups been introduced for the humerus. therefore, the purpose of this research is to establish metric standards for sex determination from the humerus of chinese, japanese and thais, as well as to compare size and sexual dimorphism in these asian mongoloid populations. the database for this study consisted of documented skeletal samples from china (n = 87), japan (n = 90), and thailand (n = 104). six standard dimensions, including maximum length, vertical head diameter, minimum midshaft diameter, maximum midshaft diameter, midshaft circumference, and epicondylar breadth were taken and subjected to stepwise and direct discriminant function analysis. of dimensions selected by the stepwise function, vertical head diameter and epicondylar breadth were the only elements common to all three groups. overall, mean accuracies were highest using formulae produced by the stepwise procedure and ranged from 86.8% in the chinese to 92.4% in the japanese to 97.1% in the thais. group comparisons also revealed that while the chinese had the largest measurements, they were the least dimorphic. the reverse was true for the thais and the japanese were intermediate on both counts. in cross validation tests, classification accuracy decreased in all cases where a formula from one group was applied to another. it was therefore concluded even though all individuals were asian mongoloids, these regionally diverse populations exhibited significant metric differences that affect sex determination from the skeleton. these findings confirm those of previous studies that there is a need for group specific metric standards of assessment.

@method differential pathway dependency discovery associated with drug response across cancer cell lines in this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). our structure, fibonacci heaps (abbreviated f-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by vuillemin and studied further by brown. f-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in 0(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in 0(1) amortized time. using f-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms.
@background psychometric evaluation of the ‘reading the mind in the eyes’ test with samples of different ages from a polish population the present paper investigated recognition errors in affective judgement of facial emotional expressions. twenty-eight females and sixteen males participated in the study. the results showed that in both males and females emotional displays could be correctly classified, but females had a higher rate of correct classification; males were more likely to have difficulty distinguishing one emotion from another. females rated emotions identically regardless of whether the emotion was displayed by a male or female face. furthermore, the two-factor structure of emotion, based on a valence and an arousal dimension, was only present for female subjects. these results further extend our knowledge about gender differences in affective information processing.
@background regression of cutaneous tumor lesions in patients intratumorally injected with a recombinant single-chain antibody-toxin targeted to erbb2/her2 abstract. the tumour antigen erbb-2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family. numerous studies have shown that erbb-2 is overexpressed in many cancers and it is prognostically important in a subset of malignancies. it is well recognised that this receptor has many characteristics that make it an excellent target for tumour-specific immunotherapy. one anti-erbb-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin or trastuzumab, has already shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. however, despite this success, it is still currently unclear how monoclonal antibodies inhibit tumour growth in vivo. this review will summarise the biological activities of a range of anti-erbb-2 mabs, as well as their possible mechanisms of action. in addition, as an active mode of immunotherapy, the current vaccine strategies for inducing or enhancing erbb-2-specific immunity will also be discussed. it is anticipated that a better understanding of the activities of anti-erbb-2 mabs will aid in the development of both passive and active immunotherapies against this important receptor.
@background simultaneous measurement of noise-activated middle-ear muscle reflex and stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions it is well established that low-level broad band noise can elicit an amplitude decrease in evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded in the opposite ear. however, the influence of the temporal characteristics of the contralateral stimulus on this effect remains largely unknown. in the present study, otoacoustic emissions evoked by 60 db spl clicks were recorded in 19 normal-hearing subjects using the otodynamics il088, successively in absence and presence of a contralateral noise that was either steady or modulated sinusoidally in amplitude at different depths (from 25% to 100% in 25 point steps) and rates (from 50 hz to 800 hz in half-octave steps). the energy was kept constant whatever the modulation depth. the results showed that the evoked otoacoustic-emission attenuation effect induced by contralateral stimulation varied depending on the modulation depth and frequency of the contralateral amplitude-modulated noise. the largest suppression effect was observed at the 100 hz modulation frequency and the 100% modulation depth. the 50 hz modulation resulted in less suppression than with unmodulated noise. an interpretation of these results in terms of the influence of temporal amplitude fluctuations falling within a certain range on medial olivocochlear bundle activity is discussed.
@background chronology of upr activation in skeletal muscle adaptations to chronic contractile activity. chronic contractile activity produces mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. this adaptation results in a significant shift in adenine nucleotide metabolism, with attendant improvements in fatigue resistance. the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are derived from the nuclear genome, necessitating the transcription of genes, the translation of mrna into protein, the targeting of the protein to a mitochondrial compartment via the import machinery, and the assembly of multisubunit enzyme complexes in the respiratory chain or matrix. putative signals involved in initiating this pathway of gene expression in response to contractile activity likely arise from combinations of accelerations in atp turnover or imbalances between mitochondrial atp synthesis and cellular atp demand, and ca(2+) fluxes. these rapid events are followed by the activation of exercise-responsive kinases, which phosphorylate proteins such as transcription factors, which subsequently bind to upstream regulatory regions in dna, to alter transcription rates. contractile activity increases the mrna levels of nuclear-encoded proteins such as cytochrome c and mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and mrna levels of upstream transcription factors like c-jun and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (nrf-1). mrna level changes are often most evident during the postexercise recovery period, and they can occur as a result of contractile activity-induced increases in transcription or mrna stability. tfam is imported into mitochondria and controls the expression of mitochondrial dna (mtdna). mtdna contributes only 13 protein products to the respiratory chain, but they are vital for electron transport and atp synthesis. contractile activity increases tfam expression and accelerates its import into mitochondria, resulting in increased mtdna transcription and replication. the result of this coordinated expression of the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, along with poorly understood changes in phospholipid synthesis, is an expansion of the muscle mitochondrial reticulum. further understanding of 1) regulation of mtdna expression, 2) upstream activators of nrf-1 and other transcription factors, 3) the identity of mrna stabilizing proteins, and 4) potential of contractile activity-induced changes in apoptotic signals are warranted.
@background molecular detection and comparison of acanthamoeba genotypes in different functions of watersheds in taiwan in this study, 14 isolates of acanthamoeba from both clinical and environmental sources belonging to seven different species were assayed for tolerance of high osmotic pressure, temperature tolerance, extracellular proteases, and cytopathic effects (cpe) on immortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cells. on the basis of the results, amoeba isolates were divided into pathogenic and nonpathogenic groups. ribosomal dna sequencing was performed on these isolates. phylogenetic relationships revealed that all the pathogenic strains tested clustered together as one group, while nonpathogenic strains clustered into other groups. sequence comparisons with previously published sequences determined that among the six new pathogenic isolates used in this study, five belong to t4 genotype and one to t11. this is the first report of a t11 genotype being found in acanthamoeba keratitis.
@method dihydroxylated phenolic acids derived from microbial metabolism reduce lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to analyze adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and on different lymphocyte subpopulations (cd2+, cd8+, cd19+, and cd56+ subsets) in chronic alcoholism, 30 well-nourished chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases and 30 matched controls were included in the study. adhesion molecules that mediate adhesion to other cells and to extracellular matrix proteins, and whose cellular expression is modified during lymphocyte activation, were selected for study. a detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory analysis, nutritional assessment, and study of adhesion molecule expression was performed. a significant higher expression of cd29 (beta1-integrin) (p = 0.001), vla-3 (p = 0.002), vla-4 (p = 0.03), and vla-5 (p = 0.001) were observed on pbmcs of chronic alcoholics, compared with control subjects, whereas no changes were observed in cd18 (beta2-integrin) and cd50 (icam-3) expression. the upregulation of cd29 and vla proteins only affected t lymphocytes (cd2+/cd8+/cd4+ cells). these data confirm that t cells of chronic alcoholics are basally activated and that changes in adhesion molecule expression on pbmcs may be responsible of disturbances of adhesion processes in chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases.
@background a role for the girk3 subunit in methamphetamine-induced attenuation of gabab receptor-activated girk currents in vta dopamine neurons single or repeated exposure to psychostimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine after postnatal week 3 leads to an enduring enhancement in the psychotomimetic responses elicited by a subsequent challenge of a stimulant in rodents. this behavioral sensitization phenomenon has been considered to be the neural consequences of stimulant-induced alterations in gene expression in the brain after a critical period of postnatal development. using a differential cloning technique, rna arbitrarily primed pcr, we have now identified from the rat neocortex a novel and developmentally regulated methamphetamine (map)-inducible gene mrt1 (map responsive transcript 1). mrt1 encodes two major types of pdz- and px-domains containing proteins of approximately 62 kda in size with different carboxy termini, mrt1a and mrt1b. the mrt1 mrnas for mrt1a, mrt1a, and for mrt1b, mrt1b, are predominantly expressed in various brain regions and the testes, respectively. acute map injection upregulated mrt1b expression in the neocortex after postnatal week 3 in a d1 receptor antagonist-sensitive manner without affecting mrt1a expression. this upregulation was mimicked by another stimulant, cocaine, whereas pentobarbital and d1 antagonist failed to change the mrt1b transcript levels. moreover, repeated daily treatment of map, but not map plus d1 antagonist, for 5 days caused an augmentation of the basal expression of mrt1b 2 and 3 weeks after the drug discontinuation. these late-developing, cocaine-crossreactive, d1 antagonist-sensitive and long-term regulations of mrt1b by map are similar to the pharmacological profiles of stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization, and therefore may be associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of the long-term neuronal adaptation.
@background in vitro evaluation of cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of alternating copolymers for use as drug delivery vehicles this work reports the design of polymer micelles with cross-linked ionic cores that display high stability. block ionomer complexes were utilized as a micellar template for the synthesis of the cross-linked micelles. such micelles represent hydrophilic nanospheres of core-shell morphology. the core comprises a network of the cross-linked polyanions, which is surrounded by the shell of hydrophilic peo chains.
@background metastatic potential and normal tissues expression of five cathepsins in murine melanomas of varying updated ascitic fluid of patients with primary liver cancer was shown to contain a latent thiol proteinase which can be activated by pepsin treatment or by autolysis at acidic environment. this enzyme resembles cathepsin b (ec 3.4.22.1) in many physical-chemical properties including substrate specificity, requirement for thiol activators and inhibition both by thiol blocking reagents and by peptidyl diazomethyl ketones, but has a higher molecular size even after activation. pepsin treatment and autolysis reduce its mr from 41 800 to 33 400 and 27 700, respectively, but all these forms are larger than human liver cathepsin b. the latent enzyme may be, therefore, an enzyme--inhibitor complex or an inactive precursor of cathepsin b due to an altered processing in golgi endoplasmatic reticulum-lysosome compartment.
@method a novel dag-dependent mechanism links pkca and cyclin b1 regulating cell cycle progression p21cip1/waf1 is the principle mediator of cell cycle arrest in response to dna damage. p21 primarily mediates g1 cell cycle arrest by inactivating g1-associated cyclin a- and cyclin e-containing cyclin/cdk complexes. in the present study we investigate the role of p21 in dna damage-induced g2 cell cycle arrest, particularly with respect to the g2-associated cyclin, cyclin b1. we demonstrate that cells lacking p21 or deficient in their ability to upregulate p21 are unable to mediate the downregulation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage as compared to wild-type cells. decreased levels of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage seen in wild-type cells is due to p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 as this can be inhibited by a proteasomal inhibitor. cell cycle analysis reveals that p21-null cells are unable sustain g2 cell cycle arrest and accumulate at greater than 4n dna content. these results indicate that p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage is necessary for the maintenance of g2 cell cycle arrest.
@background expression of piabp19, picdc2 and piserk3 during induction of somatic embryogenesis in leaflets of prunus incisa (thunb.) the first somatic single cells of carrot hypocotyl explants having the competence to form embryos in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) were identified using semi-automatic cell tracking. these competent cells are present as a small subpopulation of enlarged and vacuolated cells derived from cytoplasm-rich and rapidly proliferating non-embryogenic cells that originate from the provascular elements of the hypocotyl. a search for marker genes to monitor the transition of somatic into competent and embryogenic cells in established suspension cell cultures resulted in the identification of a gene transiently expressed in a small subpopulation of the same enlarged single cells that are formed during the initiation of the embryogenic cultures from hypocotyl explants. the predicted amino acid sequence and in vitro kinase assays show that this gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat containing receptor-like kinase protein, designated somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (serk). somatic embryos formed from cells expressing a serk promoter-luciferase reporter gene. during somatic embryogenesis, serk expression ceased after the globular stage. in plants, serk mrna could only be detected transiently in the zygotic embryo up to the early globular stage but not in unpollinated flowers nor in any other plant tissue. these results suggest that somatic cells competent to form embryos and early globular somatic embryos share a highly specific signal transduction chain with the zygotic embryo from shortly after fertilization to the early globular embryo.
@background mobility has a non-linear association with falls risk among people in residential aged care: an observational study. objectives to assess the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers.   design cross-sectional retrospective.   setting two self-care, residential facilities.   participants a total of 100 healthy old volunteers (mean age = 78.4 +/- 5.7).   measurements the study investigated the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers under single and dual-task conditions. berg balance test (bbs) and timed get up and go (tug) were used to assess balance and gait function.   results there were no significant differences found between fallers and non-fallers in bbs and tug (50.5 +/- 4.6 versus 52.5 +/- 3.4 and 9.4 +/- 3.4 versus 7.98 +/- 2.3 respectively). there were no statistically significant differences between non-fallers and fallers across all step execution parameters under the single-task condition. however, adding cognitive load to the voluntary step execution test revealed statistically significant increases in duration of the preparatory phase, swing time and the time to foot-contact (p = 0.035;p = 0.033 and p = 0.037, respectively). based on the coefficients of the logistic regression model participants with dual-task step execution times of > or =1,100 ms had five times the risk of falling than participants with execution times of <1,100 ms.   conclusions the study provides evidence that a simple, safe measure of step execution under dual-task conditions can identify elderly individuals at risk for falls.
@background influence of laser irradiation on fiber post retention objective the aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial effectiveness of the nd:yag, the ho:yag, and the er:yag laser in infected root canals.   summary background data lasers are gaining increasing importance in the field of endodontics. numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of laser treatment in disinfecting root canals.   methods in our in vitro experimental setup, 40 extracted and endodontically treated teeth were inoculated with a suspension of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and then irradiated at standardized power settings. the disinfecting efficacy of each laser was proved by classical microbiological examination.   results this article highlights that all three lasers substantially decreased the bacterial population with only minimal differences in their microbicidal efficacy. at 1.5 w, the best results were obtained by the er:yag laser achieving a mean bacterial elimination of 99.64%, followed by the nd:yag laser (99.16%), and the ho:yag laser (99.05%).   conclusion our findings indicate that all three lasers act as strongly effective microbicides without causing unfavorable temperature rises at the settings used. they can thus be considered a valuable tool for root canal treatment.
@method selection on body size and sexual size dimorphism differs between host species in a seed‐feeding beetle plants can vary substantially among species in morphological and physiological traits that influence their resistance to herbivores and their quality for herbivore growth and development. seeds of the desert trees cercidium floridum and c. microphyllum vary within and among populations in their resistance to, and suitability for, growth and development of larvae of the seed beetle, stator limbatus. we examined how this variation influences the magnitude of natural selection on the size of eggs laid by beetles and tested whether female beetles can distinguish between seeds of more vs. less suitable trees (within species). we found that selection favoring large eggs differed substantially between the two tree species (greater on c. floridum) and varied substantially among populations of c. floridum and among trees (within populations) of both c. floridum and c. microphyllum. in general, the magnitude of selection favoring large eggs correlated positively with seed coat resistance between tree species, among populations within species, and among trees within populations. female s. limbatus are capable of distinguishing seeds of the two host species and respond to species differences in selection by laying larger eggs on seeds of c. floridum than on seeds of c. microphyllum. however, despite large variation in seed suitability within populations of trees, females did not preferentially lay eggs on seeds of less resistant trees, nor did they adjust egg size in response to variation in resistance among trees.
@background characteristic differences in modulation of stomatogastric musculature by a neuropeptide in three species of cancer crabs at least 10 different substances modulate the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions of the gastric mill 4 (gm4) muscle of the crab, cancer borealis. serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, proctolin, red pigment concentrating hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide, tnrnflrfamide, and sdrnflrfamide increased and -allatostatin-3 and histamine decreased the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions. modulator efficacy was frequency dependent; tnrnflrfamide, proctolin, and allatostatin-3 were more effective when the motor neuron was stimulated at 10 hz than at 40 hz, whereas the reverse was true for dopamine and serotonin. the modulators that were most effective at high stimulus frequencies produced a significant decrease in muscle relaxation time; those that were most effective at low stimulus frequencies produced modest increases in relaxation time. thus modulator actions that appear redundant when examined only at one stimulus frequency are differentiated when a range of stimulus dynamics is studied. the effects of tnrnflrfamide, serotonin, proctolin, dopamine, and -allatostatin-3 on the amplitude and facilitation of nerve-evoked excitatory junctional potentials (ejps) in the gm4 and gastric mill 6 (gm6) muscles were compared. the ejps in gm4 have a large initial amplitude and show relatively little facilitation, whereas the ejps in gm6 have a small initial amplitude and show considerable facilitation. modulators that enhanced contractions also enhanced ejp amplitude; -allatostatin-3 reduced ejp amplitude. the effects of these modulators on ejp amplitude were modest and showed no significant frequency dependence. this suggests that the frequency dependence of modulator action on contraction results from effects on excitation-contraction coupling. the modulators affected facilitation at these junctions in a manner consistent with a change in release probability. they produced a change in facilitation that is inversely related to their action on ejp amplitude.
@method fronto-basal interhemispheric approach for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the suprasellar cistern object craniopharyngiomas frequently grow from remnants of the rathke pouch, which is located on the cisternal surface of the hypothalamic region. these lesions can also extend elsewhere in the infundibulohypophyseal axis. the aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of the frontobasal approach made through a relatively small craniotomy window for the removal of tumors protruding from the sellar-suprasellar region into the third and basal cistern.   methods thirty-one patients who were surgically treated for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region were evaluated. the diagnoses were established in all cases by using magnetic resonance and computerized tomography imaging. the initial symptoms and signs were increased intracranial pressure in eight, vision impairment or visual field defect in 16, hypopituitarism in 17, and psychological disturbances in three cases. all patients underwent surgery via the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, and the average follow-up period was 30 months. total removal of the lesion was achieved in 22 cases, six patients underwent subtotal resection, and three underwent partial removal due to tumor recurrence after previous surgeries performed with or without adjunctive radiotherapy. major complications, including impairment of the cranial nerves, were not observed in the immediate postoperative period. one patient exhibited transient memory disturbance due to infarction of the perforating vessels; after 3 months this symptom was ameliorated. none of the patients died during long-term follow up; however, four of the 22 who underwent total removal and six of the nine patients who underwent subtotal or partial removal suffered recurrence. of the 10 patients with recurrence, six experienced a small recurrence of the lesion (average 3 months postsurgery); after gamma knife surgery (gks), the size of two of the lesions was unchanged and in four reoperation was performed due to tumor enlargement during the follow-up period. ultimately, a total of eight patients (four with recurrence and four who had been treated with gks) underwent reoperation, with gross-total removal via the same approach or combined with the orbitozygomatic approach in patients with very short optic nerves. in no patient was deterioration of visual acuity and visual field observed after surgery. although all patients except four children and one adult were receiving some form of hormone replacement therapy, their endocrine status was stably controllable.   conclusions in the authors' experience, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, even made through a small craniotomy window, is a valid choice for the removal of craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region. via this approach, tumors can be removed without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, due to ease of preservation of the pituitary stalk, hypothalamic structures, and perforating vessels. this approach offers a safe and minimally invasive means of treating craniopharyngiomas.
@background environmental lead (pb) exposure versus fatty acid content in blood and milk of the mother and in the blood of newborn children abstract the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and nonesterified fatty acids was determined by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography in 41 pairs of mothers and their term infants at time of birth. the total free fatty acid content in maternal and cord plasma was positively correlated, possibly reflecting a passive, gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids. higher percentage values of several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cord than in maternal plasma phospholipids, triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids may have resulted from an active fetal fatty acid synthesis. trans fatty acids were found in every lipid class at similar or slightly lower percentages in neonatal as in maternal plasma, thus confirming their placental passage. long-chain n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are preferentially incorporated into phospholipids and sterolesters of both maternal and cord plasma. linoleic and α-linolenic acids were found in smaller portions in cord than in maternal fatty acids, in contrast to strikingly higher proportions of their long-chain polyunsaturated metabolites, which may indicate a discriminating placental transport for certain physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. conclusion the fetus appears to obtain fatty acids from a combination of de novo synthesis, a passive gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids and a selective materno-fetal placental transport for certain fatty acids, such as physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
@background adolescent gbr12909 exposure induces oxidative stress, disrupts parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and leads to hyperactivity and impulsivity in adult mice antibodies specific for the dopamine transporter (dat) was developed and characterized by immunoblot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry, and used for immunolocalization of transporter protein in rat brain at the light microscopic level. antibodies targeting the n-terminus, the second extracellular loop, and the c- terminus were generated from fusion proteins containing amino acid sequences from these respective regions. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that n-terminus and loop antibodies were specific for expressed cloned dat, recognized transporter protein in rat and human striatal membranes, and were sensitive to preabsorption with excess homologous fusion protein. immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that anti-dat antisera recognized solubilized, radiolabeled dat protein in a concentration-dependent manner. dat immunocytochemistry with these antibodies were also sensitive to preabsorption with fusion protein and to lesions of dopaminergic mesostriatal and mesocorticolimbic pathways. regional distribution of dat coincided with established dopaminergic innervation of several regions, including ventral mesencephalon, medial forebrain bundle, and dorsal and ventral striatum. however, certain mismatches between immunocytochemical distributions of dat and tyrosine hydroxylase were apparent, indicating that dopaminergic systems are heterogeneous and may use independent mechanisms for the regulation of dopamine levels in brain. the generation of specific dat antibodies will permit further characterization of the cellular and subcellular localization of dat protein, and of dopaminergic circuits in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
@result scalable transcriptional analysis routine—multiplexed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction platform for gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics we describe a multiplex nucleic acid assay that identifies and determines the abundance of four different pathogenic retroviruses (hiv-1, hiv-2, and human t-lymphotrophic virus types i and ii). retroviral dna sequences are amplified in a single, sealed tube by simultaneous pcr assays, and the resulting amplicons are detected in real time by the hybridization of four differently colored, amplicon-specific molecular beacons. the color of the fluorescence generated in the course of amplification identifies which retroviruses are present, and the number of thermal cycles required for the intensity of each color to rise significantly above background provides an accurate measure of the number of copies of each retroviral sequence that were present originally in the sample. fewer than 10 retroviral genomes can be detected. moreover, 10 copies of a rare retrovirus can be detected in the presence of 100, 000 copies of an abundant retrovirus. ninety-six samples can be analyzed in 3 hr on a single plate, and the use of a closed-tube format eliminates crossover contamination. utilizing previously well characterized clinical samples, we demonstrate that each of the pathogenic retroviruses can be identified correctly and no false positives occur. this assay enables the rapid and reliable screening of donated blood and transplantable tissues.
@background regulation of the number of cell division rounds by tissue-specific transcription factors and cdk inhibitor during ascidian embryogenesis differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. in ascidian embryos, the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. we show here in halocynthia roretzi that foxa and zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the fgf signal. we also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an fgf-dependent manner. these results suggest that foxa and zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to fgf signaling. further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of foxa and zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with fgf signaling. our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.
@background non-linear cross-domain collaborative filtering via hyper-structure transfer recommender systems always aim to provide recommendations for a user based on historical ratings collected from a single domain (e.g., movies or books) only, which may suffer from the data sparsity problem. recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge by pooling together the rating data from multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assume that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern based on the user-item co-clustering. in practice, however, the related domains do not necessarily share such a common rating pattern, and diversity among the related domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which may result in performance degradations. in this paper, we propose a novel cluster-level based latent factor model to enhance the cross-domain recommendation, which can not only learn the common rating pattern shared across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns of users in each domain that involve the discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. to this end, the proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization and an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task.
@background health care providers’ perceptions of and attitudes towards induced abortions in sub-saharan africa and southeast asia: a systematic literature review of qualitative and quantitative data background we assessed whether the safety of first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortion done by health-care providers who are not doctors (mid-level providers) is equivalent to that of procedures done by doctors in south africa and vietnam, where mid-level providers are government trained and accredited to do first-trimester abortions.   methods we did a randomised, two-sided controlled equivalence trial to compare rates of complication in abortions done by the two groups of providers. an a-priori margin of equivalence of 4.5% with 80% power and 95% ci (alpha=0.05) was used. 1160 women participated in south africa and 1734 in vietnam. women presenting for an induced abortion at up to 12 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to a doctor or a mid-level provider for manual vacuum aspiration and followed-up 10-14 days later. the primary outcome was complication of abortion. complications were recorded during the abortion procedure, before discharge from the clinic, and at follow-up. per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were done. this trial is registered at with the identifier .   findings in both countries, rates of complication satisfied the predetermined statistical criteria for equivalence: rates per 100 patients in south africa were 1.4 (eight of 576) for mid-level providers and 0 for doctors (difference 1.4, 95% ci 0.4 to 2.7); in vietnam, rates were 1.2 (ten of 824) for mid-level providers and 1.2 (ten of 812) for doctors (difference 0.0, 95% ci -1.2 to 1.1). there was one immediate complication related to analgesics. delayed complications were caused by retained products and infection.   interpretation with appropriate government training, mid-level health-care providers can provide first trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortions as safely as doctors can.
@method predictors of hearing-aid outcomes the aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of cochlear mechanical dysfunction, temporal processing deficits, and age on the ability of hearing-impaired listeners to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. sixty-eight listeners took part in the study. they were provided with linear, frequency-specific amplification to compensate for their audiometric losses, and intelligibility was assessed for speech-shaped noise (ssn) and a time-reversed two-talker masker (r2tm). behavioral estimates of cochlear gain loss and residual compression were available from a previous study and were used as indicators of cochlear mechanical dysfunction. temporal processing abilities were assessed using frequency modulation detection thresholds. age, audiometric thresholds, and the difference between audiometric threshold and cochlear gain loss were also included in the analyses. stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relative importance of the various factors for intelligibility. results showed that (a) cochlear gain loss was unrelated to intelligibility, (b) residual cochlear compression was related to intelligibility in ssn but not in a r2tm, (c) temporal processing was strongly related to intelligibility in a r2tm and much less so in ssn, and (d) age per se impaired intelligibility. in summary, all factors affected intelligibility, but their relative importance varied across maskers.
@result intradermal cytosine-phosphate-guanosine treatment reduces lung inflammation but induces ifn-γ-mediated airway hyperreactivity in a murine model of natural rubber latex allergy. allergic asthma is a complex syndrome characterized by airway obstruction, airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr). using a mouse model of allergen-induced ahr, we previously demonstrated that cd8-deficient mice develop significantly lower ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and interleukin (il)-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild-type mice. these responses were restored by adoptive transfer of antigen-primed cd8+ t cells. previously, two distinct populations of antigen-experienced cd8+ t cells, termed effector (teff) and central memory (tcm) cells, have been described. after adoptive transfer into cd8-deficient mice, teff, but not tcm, cells restored ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and il-13 levels. teff, but not tcm, cells accumulated in the lungs, and intracellular cytokine staining showed that the transferred teff cells were a source of il-13. these data suggest an important role for effector cd8+ t cells in the development of ahr and airway inflammation, which may be associated with their tc2-type cytokine production and their capacity to migrate into the lung.
@method box-particle implementation and comparison of cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter in this work, a novel approach to nonlinear non-gaussian state estimation problems is presented based on mixtures of uniform distributions with box supports. this class of filtering methods, introduced in the light of interval analysis framework, is called box particle filter (bpf). it has been shown that weighted boxes, estimating the state variables, can be propagated using interval analysis tools combined with particle filtering ideas. in this paper, in the light of the widely used bayesian inference, we present a different interpretation of the bpf by expressing it as an approximation of posterior probability density functions, conditioned on available measurements, using mixture of uniform distributions. this interesting interpretation is theoretically justified. it provides derivation of the bpf procedures with detailed discussions.
@result the effect of in vitro γ-irradiation on mitogenic responsiveness of murine lymphocytes abstract.human lymphocyte subpopulations differ in their cellular responses to ionizing radiation. to shed light on the molecular basis of this effect, we characterized the transcriptional response to 1 gy x-rays of cd4+ t lymphocytes. of 18,433 genes tested, 102 were modulated more than 1.5-fold. the majority of the strongly activated genes were p53 targets involved in dna repair and apoptosis. the expression of three of these genes was further tested by quantitative rt-pcr in lymphocyte subpopulations [cd4+ and cd8+ t, cd19+ b, cd56+ natural killer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls)] from ten adult donors. in contrast to ddb2, tnfrsf10b and bax were differentially modulated among the subpopulations and the pbls, being more activated in irradiated cd19+ b and cd8+ t lymphocytes. the level of bax activation in the various subpopulations correlated with the sensitivity of the cells to radiation, suggesting its possible role in the differential radiosensitivity of hematopoietic cell subsets.
@background meta-analysis of the association between cox-2 polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer based on case–control studies in this study, we aimed to investigate a possible association of the cox-2 polymorphisms (−765g→c and −1195a→g) and with the risk of developing epithelial ovarian carcinoma (eoc). cox-2 gene polymorphisms was investigated in 111 healthy women and 57 patients with eoc. individuals who had −765 cg, −1195 aa genotype, and −765 c allele had increased risk for ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01) and individuals with −765 gg, −1195 ag genotypes and −1195 g allele seem to be protected from ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01). haplotype analysis confirmed the association of cox-2 gene variants with ovarian carcinoma and revealed that the frequencies of −765c: −1195a haplotype frequencies was significantly higher in patients as compared with those of controls (p = 0.048). we state that there appears to be a modulating role for the cox-2 −1195a→g and −765g→c polymorphisms in the development of eoc. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show such an association.
@method psom+ : parametrized self-organizing maps for noisy and incomplete data we report on two new improvements for the “parameterised sel f-organizing map” (psom). both achieve a significant increase in mapping ac curacy and computational efficiency. for a growing number of training points the use of higher orde r polynomials to construct the psom “mapping manifold” in [7] can suffer fro m the increasing tendency to oscillate between the support points. we propos e here to confine the algorithm to a subset of the training knots, resulting in what we call the “local-psom” algorithm. this allows to avoid the use of highdegree polynomials without sacrificing accuracy. at the same time, the new approach offers a significant saving in required computations. a second way to improve the mapping preciseness makes use of t he superior approximation properties of chebyshev polynomials fo r the psom mapping manifold. the benefits of the two new approaches are demonstrated with t o benchmark problems:(i) approximating a gaussian bell function and (ii) learning of the (forward and inverse) kinematics of a 3 dof robot finger. i n both cases the psom algorithm exhibit an excellent generalisation ability and that already for a very small training set size of 3 3 3 points.
@method cisminer: genome-wide in-silico cis-regulatory module prediction by fuzzy itemset mining we are given a large database of customer transactions. each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. we present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. the algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. we also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.
@background bacterioplankton abundance and growth in a river-dominated estuary: relationships with temperature and resources the importance of algal and detrital food supplies to the planktonic food web of a highly disturbed, estuarine ecosystem was evaluated in response to declining zooplankton and fish populations. we assessed organic matter bioavailability among a diversity of habitats and hydrologic inputs over 2 years in san francisco estuary's sacramento–san joaquin river delta. results show that bioavailable dissolved organic carbon from external riverine sources supports a large component of ecosystem metabolism. however, bioavailable particulate organic carbon derived primarily from internal phytoplankton production is the dominant food supply to the planktonic food web. the relative importance of phytoplankton as a food source is surprising because phytoplankton production is a small component of the ecosystem's organic-matter mass balance. our results indicate that management plans aimed at modifying the supply of organic matter to riverine, estuarine, and coastal food webs need to incorporate the potentially wide nutritional range represented by different organic matter sources.
@background statistical track-before-detect methods applied to faint optical observations of resident space objects the objective of multi-object estimation is to simultaneously estimate the number of objects and their states from a set of observations in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, false observations, and noise. this estimation problem can be formulated in a bayesian framework by modeling the (hidden) set of states and set of observations as random finite sets (rfss) that covers thinning, markov shifts, and superposition. a prior for the hidden rfs together with the likelihood of the realization of the observed rfs gives the posterior distribution via the application of bayes rule. we propose a new class of rfs distributions that is conjugate with respect to the multiobject observation likelihood and closed under the chapman-kolmogorov equation. this result is tested on a bayesian multi-target tracking algorithm.
@method a fully convolutional two-stream fusion network for interactive image segmentation interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has many applications. previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the foreground and background distributions. in this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has much better understanding of objectness and can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the rgb channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. we generate many of such pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep fully convolutional networks (fcns). finally the output probability maps of our fcn-8s model is integrated with graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. our model is trained on the pascal segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. experimental results on both seen and unseen objects demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.
@result garlic (allium sativum) supplementation: influence on egg production, quality, and yolk cholesterol level in layer hens a total of 2123 eggs obtained from brown leghorn hens (unselected since 1965, isa brown, commercial brown egg layer) and babcock hens (commercial white egg layer) at 32, 50, and 68 wk of age were used to investigate relationships among measures of albumen quality and a functional property of albumen. the eggs were sampled fresh and after storage for 5 and 10 d. at sampling, eggs were weighed and broken, and albumen height, ph, and volume after whipping for 80 s were measured. also, yolks were weighed, dried shells were weighed, and albumen weight was determined by difference. egg weight and the weights of the 3 principal components of the egg all increased with increasing age of the hen, with yolk weights increasing proportionately more. with storage, egg and albumen weights decreased, whereas yolk weight increased. eggs from brown leghorn hens were smallest but had proportionately the largest yolks. albumen height decreased with time in storage, and albumen ph and whipping volume increased. differences between lines suggested that selection has changed the proportion of the yolk, albumen, and shell and has increased albumen height. albumen height and whipping volume were negatively correlated, and differences between lines suggest that selection could have decreased the foaming ability of albumen, a principal reason for including eggs in many processed food products.
@method the role of co-administration of ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate on brain biochemical changes in wistar rats during the hot-humid season the mild yield characteristics of smallholder agropastoral fulani red sokoto goats were evaluated using records obtained from a total of 92 does in 6 herds, collected over a 2-year period. the results indicated that the total yield was 79.8±3.2 kg, the daily yield 0.66±0.03 kg, the peak yield 1.21±0.07 kg and the day of peak production 28.7±2.1 day of lactation. the milk yield characteristics were highly variable with a coefficient of variability of 38.6% to 69.8%. the characteristics were significantly (p<0.01–0.05) influenced by herd, season, parity and litter size of the dam. highly positive and significant (p<0.01) correlations (r = 0.66–0.99) existed between the total yield and the average daily yield, peak yield, initial yield and day 120 yield. a negative and significant (p<0.05) correlation (r = –0.33) was observed between the peak day and the initial yield. the non-homogeneity of the milk yield characteristics in red sokoto does suggests the possibility of improving their daily productivity by selection of high yielding does. selection for higher initial milk yield may also improve other milk yield characteristics.
@method a neural network for text representation we propose a new hierarchical generative model for textual data, where words may be generated by topic specific distributions at any level in the hierarchy. this model is naturally well-suited to clustering documents in preset or automatically generated hierarchies, as well as categorising new documents in an existing hierarchy. training algorithms are derived for both cases, and illustrated on real data by clustering news stories and categorising newsgroup messages. finally, the generative model may be used to derive a fisher kernel expressing similarity between documents.
@method spatial ability and other predictors of gameplay time : understanding barriers to learning in game-based virtual environments the emerging field of the learning sciences is one that is interdisciplinary, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and research paradigms so as to build understandings of the nature and conditions of learning, cognition, and development. learning sciences researchers investigate cognition in context, at times emphasizing one more than the other but with the broad goal of developing evidence-based claims derived from both laboratory-based and naturalistic investigations that result in knowledge about how people learn. this work can involve the development of technological tools, curriculum, and especially theory that can be used to understand and support learning. a fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs, and the activity in which the learner participates. in other words, learning, cognition, knowing, and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes. if one believes that context matters in terms of learning and cognition, research paradigms that simply examine these processes as isolated variables within laboratory or other impoverished contexts of participation will necessarily lead to an incomplete understanding of their relevance in more naturalistic settings (brown, 1992).1 alternatively, simply observing learning and cognition as they naturally correspondence and requests for reprints should be sent to sasha a. barab, school of education,
@method adapting asynchronous messaging middleware to ad hoc networking recent advances in wireless networking technologies and the growing success of mobile computing devices, such as laptop computers, third generation mobile phones, personal digital assistants, watches and the like, are enabling new classes of applications that present challenging problems to designers. mobile devices face temporary loss of network connectivity when they move; they are likely to have scarce resources, such as low battery power, slow cpu speed and little memory; they are required to react to frequent and unannounced changes in the environment, such as high variability of network bandwidth, and in the remote resources availability, and so on. to support designers building mobile applications, research in the field of middleware systems has proliferated. middleware aims at facilitating communication and coordination of distributed components, concealing difficulties raised by mobility from application engineers as much as possible. in this survey, we examine characteristics of mobile distributed systems and distinguish them from their fixed counterpart. we introduce a framework and a categorization of the various middleware systems designed to support mobility, and we present a detailed and comparative review of the major results reached in this field. an analysis of current trends inside the mobile middleware community and a discussion of further directions of research conclude the survey.
@background hepatic leukostasis and hypoxic stress in adhesion molecule-deficient mice after gut ischemia/reperfusion. background & aims although it has been reported that gut ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) elicits neutrophil-dependent liver dysfunction, little is known about the kinetics of leukocyte accumulation in the hepatic microcirculation after gut i/r. the aim of this study was to determine the temporal relationship between leukocyte sequestration and oxidative stress in rat liver after occlusion (30 minutes) and reperfusion (60 minutes) of the superior mesenteric artery and assess the effects of neutrophil depletion or immunoneutralization of either intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) or the leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein cd11/cd18 on the hepatic microvascular responses to gut i/r.   methods leukocyte accumulation, number of nonperfused sinusoids, and autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) were monitored using intravital videomicroscopy both before and after gut i/r.   results the number of adherent leukocytes in both midzonal and pericentral regions after gut i/r was elevated. autofluorescence of nadh increased after reperfusion (indicating hypoxia), particularly in the pericentral region. neutrophil depletion or antibodies to either icam-1 or cd11/cd18 blunted the gut i/r-induced increases in nadh autofluorescence in the pericentral region, leukocyte adherence, and nonperfused sinusoids.   conclusions leukocytes accumulate in the liver after gut i/r via interaction of cd11/cd18 and icam-1. the leukocytes appear to mediate an oxidative stress, occurring in proximity to nonperfused sinusoids, that may contribute to liver injury.
@method gaze-contingent interactive visualization of high-dynamic-range imagery we propose a technique for fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high quality image, without converting to high dynamic range (hdr) first. skipping the physically based hdr assembly step simplifies the acquisition pipeline. this avoids camera response curve calibration and is computationally efficient. it also allows for including flash images in the sequence. our technique blends multiple exposures, guided by simple quality measures like saturation and contrast. this is done in a multiresolution fashion to account for the brightness variation in the sequence. the resulting image quality is comparable to existing tone mapping operators.
@method projection of the array-ol specification language onto the kahn process network computation model publisher summary this chapter discusses distributed process networks. process networks are networks of sequential processes connected by channels behaving like fifo (first in, first out) queues. these are used in signal and image processing applications that need to run in bounded memory for infinitely long periods of time dealing with possibly infinite streams of data. this chapter discusses distributed implementation of this computation model. the implementation of a distributed process network by using distributed fifos to build the distributed application is discussed. the platform used to support this is the common object request broker architecture (corba) middleware. indeed, each process of the process network can be written in a different language and run on a different hardware, provided that these are supported by the chosen object request broker (orb). in addition of the heterogeneity, implementation presents the following characteristics; automation of data transfer between distributed processes, dynamic and interactive linking of the processes to form the data flow, hybrid data-driven, demand-driven data transfer protocol, with thresholds for load balancing, and the implementation was carried out, such as to enable a distributed or local execution without any change to the program source. a process network deployment and distributed execution is described. the transfer strategies (demand and data driven) are detailed.
@background cancer-associated fibroblasts are activated in incipient neoplasia to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation in an nf-kappab-dependent manner. we studied the role of nf-κb in acute inflammation caused by gut ischemia-reperfusion through selective ablation of iκb kinase (ikk)-β, the catalytic subunit of ikk that is essential for nf-κb activation. ablation of ikk-β in enterocytes prevented the systemic inflammatory response, which culminates in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) that is normally triggered by gut ischemia-reperfusion. ikk-β removal from enterocytes, however, also resulted in severe apoptotic damage to the reperfused intestinal mucosa. these results show the dual function of the nf-κb system, which is responsible for both tissue protection and systemic inflammation, and underscore the caution that should be exerted in using nf-κb and ikk inhibitors.
@method gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveal transcriptional signatures as novel biomarkers of cardiac remodeling in rats with aldosteronism and hypertensive heart disease. non-obese diabetic (nod) mice spontaneously develop autoimmunity to the insulin producing beta cells leading to insulin-dependent diabetes. in this study we developed and used new data analysis and mining approaches on combined proteome and transcriptome (molecular phenotype) data to define pathways affected by abnormalities in peripheral leukocytes of young nod female mice. cells were collected before mice show signs of autoimmunity (age, 2–4 weeks). we extracted both protein and rna from nod and c57bl/6 control mice to conduct both proteome analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and transcriptome analysis on affymetrix expression arrays. we developed a new approach to analyze the two-dimensional gel proteome data that included two-way analysis of variance, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. lists of differentially expressed proteins and transcripts were subjected to pathway analysis using a commercial service. from the list of 24 proteins differentially expressed between strains we identified two highly significant and interconnected networks centered around oncogenes (myc and mycn) and apoptosis-related genes (bcl2 and casp3). the 273 genes with significant strain differences in rna expression levels created six interconnected networks with a significant over-representation of genes related to cancer, cell cycle, and cell death. they contained many of the same genes found in the proteome networks (including myc and mycn). the combination of the eight, highly significant networks created one large network of 272 genes of which 82 had differential expression between strains either at the protein or the rna level. we conclude that new proteome data analysis strategies and combined information from proteome and transcriptome can enhance the insights gained from either type of data alone. the overall systems biology of prediabetic nod mice points toward abnormalities in regulation of the opposing processes of cell renewal and cell death even before there are any clear signatures of immune system activation.
@result the effect of exercise intensity on endothelial function in physically inactive lean and obese adults the transient impairment of endothelial function following a high-fat meal is well established. brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (fmd) decreases between 2 and 6 h post ingestion. whether this impairment can be reduced with acute aerobic exercise has not been investigated. the purpose of this study was to investigate if a single sustained aerobic exercise session can counteract the postprandial attenuation in brachial artery fmd associated with the ingestion of a high-fat meal. eight apparently healthy adults (five men, three women), age 25.5 ± 0.8 years, performed three treatment conditions in a counter-balanced design: (1) low-fat meal alone (lfm), (2) high-fat meal alone (hfm), and (3) one session of aerobic exercise presented 2 h after ingesting a high-fat meal (hfm-ex). the examination of brachial artery fmd was performed at baseline and 4 h following the ingestion of the meal for each treatment condition. a 3 × 2 (treatment × time) repeated measures anova exhibited a significant interaction (p = 0.019). preprandial fmds were similar (p = 0.863) among all three treatment conditions. the fmds following the lfm (7.18 ± 1.31%) and hfm-ex (8.72 ± 0.94%) were significantly higher (p = 0.001) than the fmd following the hfm (4.29 ± 1.64%). fmd was significantly elevated above preprandial values following the hfm-ex (5.61 ± 1.54 to 8.72 ± 0.94%, p = 0.005) but was unchanged following the lfm (6.17 ± 0.94 to 7.18 ± 1.31%, p = 0.317) and the hfm (5.73 ± 1.23 to 4.29 ± 1.64%, p = 0.160). these findings suggest that a single aerobic exercise session cannot only counteract the postprandial endothelial dysfunction induced by the ingestion of a high-fat meal, but also increase brachial artery fmd in apparently healthy adults.
@result identification and characterization of an avian β-defensin orthologue, avian β-defensin 9, from quails abstractantimicrobial peptides (amps) are essential components of innate immunity in a range of species from drosophila to humans and are generally thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. in order to discover novel amps in the chicken, we have implemented a bioinformatic approach that involves the clustering of more than 420,000 chicken expressed sequence tags (ests). similarity searching of proteins—predicted to be encoded by these est clusters—for homology to known amps has resulted in the in silico identification of full-length sequences for seven novel gallinacins (gal-4 to gal-10), a novel cathelicidin and a novel liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (leap-2) in the chicken. differential gene expression of these novel genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. an evolutionary analysis of the gallinacin family has detected sites—primarily in the mature amp—that are under positive selection in these molecules. the functional implications of these results are discussed.
@method an assessment of socio-economic inequalities in health among elderly in greece, italy and spain in belgium, income-related inequality in ill-health among the 65- is present, but reduces significantly as soon as one restricts the analysis to the 65+. the main goal of this paper is to check whether these findings (based on current income) are robust to the income concept used. the analysis is repeated using estimates of permanent income. measured inequality among the 65+ remains very limited, suggesting that the observed findings are not heavily dependent upon the income concept. finally, i suggest an explanation for the observed difference in inequality between the 65- and the 65+. i argue that this difference is likely to be correlated with differences across income groups of (1) sample attrition; and (2) mortality.
@result seed-mediated gene flow promotes genetic diversity of weedy rice within populations: implications for weed management apart from their significance in genetic conservation, barley landraces are still favoured by local farmers in low-input farming systems. they often perform more predictably under adverse conditions than modern cultivars due to local adaptation. increased seed exchange between farmers may put adaptation of local populations of barley landraces at risk. isozyme markers were used to investigate differentiation and infer gene flow between local populations of barley landrace arabi aswad in northern syria. inferred gene flow decreased exponentially with geographic distance and may imply that seed exchange between farmers is limited to a regional scale and diminishes over longer distance. gene flow seems to be a suitable index for estimating seed exchange in highly inbreeding crop species such as barley. in the future, improved mobility of farmers and extension work may facilitate seed exchange over longer distances, and consequently jeopardise preservation of locally adapted landraces in barley.
@background role of group ii and iii metabotropic glutamate receptors in rhythmic patterns of the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro intracellular recording from rat lumbar motoneurones showed that patterned electrical stimulation of one dorsal root induced alternating patterns typical of fictive locomotion, accompanied by a reduction in the antidromic spike afterhyperpolarization (ahp). since the ahp depended linearly on extracellular k(+) ([k(+)](o)), from the ahp fall we calculated that [k(+)](o) rose to 7.9+/-0.4 mm, a value within the 7-10 mm range known to elicit fictive locomotion. to confirm the specificity of this approach we also tested concentrations of n-methyl-d-aspartate (2 microm) below threshold for fictive locomotion, and we observed that, despite strong excitation, the estimated [k(+)](o) was 6 mm, i.e. outside the range for fictive locomotion. we suggest that synaptic activity induced by a certain pattern of electrical stimulation of afferent fibres evoked persistent elevation in [k(+)](o) which triggered the locomotor network to generate rhythmic patterns.
@result brachypodium cell wall mutant with enhanced saccharification potential despite increased lignin content brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) has been proposed as a model for grasses, but there is limited knowledge regarding its lignins and no data on lignin-related mutants. the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (cad) genes involved in lignification are promising targets to improve the cellulose-to-ethanol conversion process. down-regulation of cad often induces a reddish coloration of lignified tissues. based on this observation, we screened a chemically induced population of brachypodium mutants (bd21-3 background) for red culm coloration. we identified two mutants (bd4179 and bd7591), with mutations in the bdcad1 gene. the mature stems of these mutants displayed reduced cad activity and lower lignin content. their lignins were enriched in 8-o-4- and 4-o-5-coupled sinapaldehyde units, as well as resistant inter-unit bonds and free phenolic groups. by contrast, there was no increase in coniferaldehyde end groups. moreover, the amount of sinapic acid ester-linked to cell walls was measured for the first time in a lignin-related cad grass mutant. functional complementation of the bd4179 mutant with the wild-type bdcad1 allele restored the wild-type phenotype and lignification. saccharification assays revealed that bd4179 and bd7591 lines were more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than wild-type plants. here, we have demonstrated that bdcad1 is involved in lignification of brachypodium. we have shown that a single nucleotide change in bdcad1 reduces the lignin level and increases the degree of branching of lignins through incorporation of sinapaldehyde. these changes make saccharification of cells walls pre-treated with alkaline easier without compromising plant growth.
@result quantification of plaque lipids in the aortic root of apoe-deficient mice by 3d dixon magnetic resonance imaging in an ex vivo model specific mri techniques have been used to determine the dimensional and compositional properties of atherosclerotic lesions in carotid endarterectomy tissues. a quantitative comparison of areas of specific features in typical tissue segments was performed using mr images and histologic images. the mean difference for the measurements by the two methods was 4.5% for the total vessel, 5.3% for the internal carotid artery lumen, and 5.0% for the external carotid lumen. for other less abundant components, the mean difference was 14.2%. for direct characterization, individual tissue components were isolated by microdissection and their t1 and t2 relaxation times measured. highly calcified areas typically had rather short t1 (452-837 ms) and short t2 (10.4-18.4 ms). in contrast, regions enriched in lipid had much longer t1 (1,380-1,480 ms) and longer t2 (35.3-49.0 ms). other components such as thrombus had intermediate t1 (1,180 ms) and short t2 (15.4 ms). t2 parametric imaging was used as a complementary approach for segmentation and quantitation of tissue components. in fresh tissue, several different components exhibited different t2 ranges: calcified/solid lipid (13-18 ms). cellular/ecm (9-30 ms), fluid lipid (35-40 ms): fibrous (50-60 ms). these results demonstrate the utility of mri for identifying and quantifying specific components of atherosclerotic plaque ex vivo, and suggest its value for these measurements in vivo as well.
@background two newly identified sites in the n-terminal regulatory domain of aurora-a are essential for auto-inhibition aurora-a is a centrosome-localized serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers. here, we report an intramolecular inhibitory regulation in aurora-a between its n-terminal regulatory domain (aa 1-128, nt) and the c-terminal catalytic domain (aa 129-403, cd). removal of nt results in a significant increase in kinase activity. nt inhibited the activity of the single c-terminal kinase domain, but had little effect on the activity of the full-length of aurora-a. pp1 is not involved in this regulation, instead, nt interacts cd directly in vitro and in vivo. the non-aurora box (aa 64-128) in the n-terminal negatively regulated the kinase activity of the c-terminal kinase domain by intramolecular interaction with aa 240-300 within the c-terminal.
@method a probabilistic calibration of climate sensitivity and terrestrial carbon change in genie-1 this paper describes an approach to computing probabilistic assessments of future climate, using a climate model. it clarifies the nature of probability in this context, and illustrates the kinds of judgements that must be made in order for such a prediction to be consistent with the probability calculus. the climate model is seen as a tool for making probabilistic statements about climate itself, necessarily involving an assessment of the model’s imperfections. a climate event, such as a 2^c increase in global mean temperature, is identified with a region of ‘climate-space’, and the ensemble of model evaluations is used within a numerical integration designed to estimate the probability assigned to that region.
@result enriched endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria interactions result in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in oocytes from obese mice proper function of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and mitochondria is crucial for cellular homeostasis, and dysfunction at either site has been linked to pathophysiological states, including metabolic diseases. although the er and mitochondria play distinct cellular roles, these organelles also form physical interactions with each other at sites defined as mitochondria-associated er membranes (mams), which are essential for calcium, lipid and metabolite exchange. here we show that in the liver, obesity leads to a marked reorganization of mams resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload, compromised mitochondrial oxidative capacity and augmented oxidative stress. experimental induction of er-mitochondria interactions results in oxidative stress and impaired metabolic homeostasis, whereas downregulation of pacs-2 or ip3r1, proteins important for er-mitochondria tethering or calcium transport, respectively, improves mitochondrial oxidative capacity and glucose metabolism in obese animals. these findings establish excessive er-mitochondrial coupling as an essential component of organelle dysfunction in obesity that may contribute to the development of metabolic pathologies such as insulin resistance and diabetes.
@background mondo/chrebp-mlx-regulated transcriptional network is essential for dietary sugar tolerance in drosophila the paralogous transcription factors chrebp and mondoa, together with their common binding partner mlx, have emerged as key mediators of intracellular glucose sensing. by regulating target genes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis, they mediate metabolic adaptation to changing glucose levels. as disturbed glucose homeostasis plays a central role in human metabolic diseases and as cancer cells often display altered glucose metabolism, better understanding of cellular glucose sensing will likely uncover new therapeutic opportunities. here we review the regulation, function and evolutionary conservation of the chrebp/mondoa-mlx glucose sensing system and discuss possible directions for future research.
@result the insulin–melatonin antagonism: studies in the lew.1ar1-iddm rat (an animal model of human type 1 diabetes mellitus) experiments were conducted in male rats to study the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on circadian rhythms of (a) plasma corticosterone concentrations; (b) motor activity; and (c) metabolic patterns. animals were entrained to ld cycles of 12:12 hr and fed ad libitum. a daily rhythm of plasma corticosterone concentrations was found in controls animals with peak levels at 2400 hr and low values during the remaining hours. this rhythm was statistically confirmed by the cosinor method and had an amplitude of 3.37 micrograms/100 ml and the acrophase at 100 hr. a loss of the normal circadian variation was observed in diabetic animals, with a nadir at the onset of light period and high values throughout the remaining hours; cosinor analysis of these data showed no circadian rhythm, delete and a higher mean level than controls. as expected, normal rats presented most of their motor activity during the dark period with 80% of total daily activity; the cosinor method demonstrated a circadian rhythm with an amplitude of 60% of the mean level and the acrophase at 0852 hr. both diabetic and control rats showed a similar activity during the light phase, but diabetic animals had less activity than controls during the night and their percentage of total daily activity was similar in both phases of the ld cycle (50% for each one). with the cosinor method we were able to show the persistence of a circadian rhythm in the motor activity of diabetic rats, but with a mesor and amplitude lower than in controls (amplitude rested at 60% of the mean level) and its acrophase advanced to 0148 hr.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
@background anti-cancer effects of aloe-emodin: a systematic review aloe-emodin (1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-anthraquinone) is an active component from the root and rhizome of rheum palmatum. the study investigated the effects and mechanisms of aloe-emodin-induced cell death in human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line ch27. aloe-emodin (40 microm)-induced ch27 cell apoptosis was confirmed by dna fragmentation (dna ladders and sub-g(1) formation). aloe-emodin-induced apoptosis of ch27 cells involved modulation of the expression of bcl-2 family proteins, such as bclx(l), bag-1, and bak, and was associated with the translocation of bak and bax from cytosolic to particulate fractions. aloe-emodin-treated ch27 cells had an increased relative abundance of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction. results demonstrated that the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 is an important determinant of apoptotic death induced by aloe-emodin. these results suggest that aloe-emodin induces ch27 cell death by the bax and fas death pathway.
@method micro-structural brain alterations in aviremic hiv+ patients with minor neurocognitive disorders: a multi-contrast study at high field objectives: to examine the association between the type and number of subjective memory complaints (smcs) and performance on objective cognitive tests.
@method hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cyclophosphamide metabolism , liver toxicity , and mortality following we evaluated the relationship between the signs and symptoms of the clinical syndrome called veno-occlusive disease of the liver after bone marrow transplantation and the histological findings in 76 patients who later came to autopsy. coded necropsy liver was scored for individual histological features that were correlated with prospectively assessed clinical features that the patients had exhibited during life. patients were stratified into two groups: those with severe clinical veno-occlusive disease (n = 32) and those without. clinically severe veno-occlusive disease was statistically correlated with several zone 3 acinar changes: occluded hepatic venules, the frequency of occluded hepatic venules x degree of occlusion, eccentric luminal narrowing/phlebosclerosis, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (all p < or = 0.03). there was a significant relationship between the number of these histological abnormalities in zone 3 of the liver acinus and a clinical diagnosis of severe veno-occlusive disease (p = 0.003). the presence of ascites was significantly correlated with occluded venules, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (p = 0.001). maximum serum bilirubin in the first 20 days after transplant was significantly correlated with sinusoidal fibrosis, hepatocyte necrosis and eccentric luminal sclerosis/phlebosclerosis (p < 0.01) but not with venular occlusion. the clinical syndrome of liver toxicity (commonly called veno-occlusive disease) that results from cytoreductive therapy before bone marrow transplant is strongly correlated with a constellation of histological lesions involving structures in zone 3 of the liver acinus and the hepatic venules into which sinusoidal blood flows. this study suggests that there is no single diagnostic histological feature. the severity of clinical veno-occlusive disease appears to be proportional to the number of such histological changes and is not due solely to occlusion of small hepatic venules.
@background the cghaa1-regulon mediates response and tolerance to acetic acid stress in the human pathogen candida glabrata saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein (hsp). this hsp30 is induced by several stresses, including heat shock, ethanol exposure, severe osmostress, weak organic acid exposure and glucose limitation. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activities of heat shocked and weak acid-adapted, hsp30 mutant and wild-type cells, revealed that hsp30 induction leads to a downregulation of the stress-stimulation of this h(+)-atpase. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activity consumes a substantial fraction of the atp generated by the cell, a usage that will be increased by the h(+)-atpase stimulation occurring with several hsp30-inducing stresses. hsp30 might therefore provide an energy conservation role, limiting excessive atp consumption by plasma membrane h(+)-atpase during prolonged stress exposure or glucose limitation. consistent with the role of hsp30 being energy conservation, hsp30 null cultures give lower final biomass yields. they also have lower atp levels, consistent with higher h(+)-atpase activity, at the glucose exhaustion stage of batch fermentations (diauxic lag), when hsp30 is normally induced. loss of hsp30 does not affect several stress tolerances but it extends the time needed for cells to adapt to growth under several stressful conditions where the maintenance of homeostasis will demand an unusually high usage of energy, hsp30 is the first yeast gene identified as both weak organic acid-inducible and assisting the adaptation to growth in the presence of these acids.
@background chlamydial type iii secretion system needle protein induces protective immunity against chlamydia muridarum intravaginal infection chlamydia trachomatis sexually transmitted infections cause considerable morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology (29, 31, 57), pathogenesis (11, 83, 117), genomics (94), and epidemiology (91) of this parasite. chlamydial urogenital tract infections are readily cured with antibiotics, but control measures based on antimicrobial chemotherapy alone are hampered by the frequency of asymptomatic infections and delayed diagnosis (9). definitive control of c. trachomatis sexually transmitted diseases (stds) is possible through the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine (24). progress toward the development of an effective vaccine has been disappointingly modest, as it has been for vaccines to other sexually transmitted pathogens that infect the genital tract mucosae. the strict tropism for mucosal epithelial cells, the complex biology and antigenic structure, and the predilection to cause persistent infection have presented formidable challenges to chlamydial vaccine development. a heightened understanding of protective immunity to c. trachomatis urogenital infection has emerged in the past decade from studies using a mouse model of chlamydial genital tract infection. the insights are of considerable interest because they offer promise for the development of an efficacious chlamydial vaccine. this review focuses on that progress and summarizes the current understanding of protective immune mechanisms that function against murine chlamydial urogenital infection. we also discuss specific requirements for a vaccine to protect against chlamydial stds and the challenges presently confronting us in achieving that goal.
@background activity and expression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/cd73 are increased by thyroid hormones in vascular smooth muscle cells sympathetically innervated smooth muscles, including those in some arteries, arterioles, cat nictitating membrane and vas deferens, have α 1 -adrenoceptors which respond to exogenously applied noradrenaline (na) by producing contractions which can be abolished by α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists such as prazosin. stimulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating these muscles causes release of na and a contractile response. however, this contraction is (at least partly) resistant to specific α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. this apparent contradiction could be explained by a variety of ad hoc explanations (such as high transmitter concentrations within the nerve-muscle junction, or prejunctional enhancement of transmitter release by the antagonist due to prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptor blockade etc.) but recently two hypotheses have been advanced which may have more fundamental implications for sympathetic neurotransmission. first, hirst and neild and their colleagues suggested that the electrical and mechanical responses of some smooth muscles were resistant to α-adrenoceptor antagonists because neuronally released na was acting not only on α-adrenoceptors but also on a new class of adrenoceptors which they designated γ-receptors, located near the nerve-muscle junction. the crucial experiments in support of this hypothesis were originally performed on the arterioles of the guinea-pig submucosa [1], but the idea has been extended to include many other sympathetically innervated smooth muscles [2], including guinea-pig vas deferens, which was also the smooth muscle preparation in which the experimental evidence for an alternative hypothesis was obtained by fedan et al. [3]. they proposed that the α-blocker-resistant portion of the contractile response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was mediated by atp, acting as a cotransmitter with na. full details of the early development of the concept of cotransmission in sympathetic nerves have been reviewed previously [4, 6, 7]. the experimental evidence relating to the co-transmission hypothesis is outlined below, drawing mainly on results obtained in guinea-pig vas deferens, where most of the more recent experiments have been performed.
@background overcoming heterologous protein interdependency to optimize p450-mediated taxol precursor synthesis in escherichia coli protein engineering of cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) has been very successful in generating valuable non-natural activities and properties, allowing these powerful catalysts to be used for the synthesis of drug metabolites and in biosynthetic pathways for the production of precursors of artemisinin and paclitaxel. collected experience indicates that the p450s are highly 'evolvable' - they are particularly robust to mutation in their active sites and readily accept new substrates and exhibit new selectivities. their ability to adapt to new challenges upon mutation may reflect the nonpolar nature of their active sites as well as their high degree of conformational variability.
@result life after prostate cancer treatment: a mixed methods study of the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners the purpose of this study was to illuminate the experience of living after radical prostatectomy (rp) for localized prostate cancer (lpc). ten men were interviewed after rp. the interview text was qualitatively analyzed using the content analysis. the men suffered from worry, anxiety, and distress, and longed for life as they had lived it before the diagnosis. changes in bodily functions after rp include urine incontinence (ui) and/or erectile dysfunction (ed) making the patient feel like a changed man with a lost sex life, with changes in his intimate relations with his wife, and with lowered self-esteem. most men choose to cope on their own. coping strategies in our study population included finding new areas of interest and a new focus in the present. in the present study, living after rp meant striving to gain control over, and become reconciled with, the new life situation as a changed man living with an altered self.
@method bone mineral density after implantation of a femoral neck hip prosthesis – a prospective 5 year follow-up our aim was to determine the precision of the measurements of bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the proximal femur before and after implantation of an uncemented implant, with particular regard to the significance of retro- and prospective studies. we examined 60 patients to determine the difference in preoperative bmd between osteoarthritic and healthy hips. the results showed a preoperative bmd of the affected hip which was lower by a mean of 4% and by a maximum of 9% compared with the opposite side. in addition, measurements were made in the operated hip before and at ten days after operation to determine the effect of the implantation of an uncemented custom-made femoral stem. the mean increase in the bmd was 8% and the maximum was 24%. previous retrospective studies have reported a marked loss of bmd on the operated side. the precision of double measurements using a special foot jig showed a modified coefficient of variation of 0.6% for the non-operated side in 15 patients and of 0.6% for the operated femur in 20 patients. the effect of rotation on the precision of the measurements after implantation of an uncemented femoral stem was determined in ten explanted femora and for the operated side in ten patients at 10 degrees rotation and in 20 patients at 30 degrees rotation. rotation within 30 degrees influenced the precision in studies in vivo and in vitro by a mean of 3% and in single cases in up to 60%. precise prediction of the degree of loss of bmd is thus only possible in prospective cross-sectional measurements, since the effect of the difference in preoperative bmd, as well as the apparent increase in bmd after implantation of an uncemented stem, is not known from retrospective studies. the dexa method is a reliable procedure for determining periprosthetic bmd when positioning and rotation are strictly controlled.

@result importance of the ncp7-like domain in the recognition of pre-let-7g by the pluripotency factor lin28 several recent studies have provided evidence that lin28, a cytoplasmic rna-binding protein, inhibits the biogenesis of members of the let-7 microrna family at the dicer step in both mammals and caenorhabditis elegans. however, the precise mechanism of inhibition is still poorly understood. here we report on an in vitro study, which combined rnase footprinting, gel shift binding assays, and processing assays, to investigate the molecular basis and function of the interaction between the native let-7g precursor (pre-let-7g) and lin28. we have mapped the structure of pre-let-7g and identified some regions of the terminal loop of pre-let-7g that physically interact with lin28. we have also identified a conformational change upon lin28 binding that results in the unwinding of an otherwise double-stranded region at the dicer processing site of pre-let-7g. furthermore, we showed that a mutant pre-let-7g that displays an open upper stem inhibited pre-let-7g dicer processing to the same extent as lin28. the data support a mechanism by which lin28 can directly inhibit let-7g biogenesis at the dicer processing step.
@background nf‐κb and androgen receptor variant expression correlate with human bph progression the metabolic syndrome is common in countries with western lifestyles. it comprises a number of disorders—including insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity—that all act as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. urological diseases have also been linked to the metabolic syndrome. most established aspects of the metabolic syndrome are linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer. fasting plasma insulin, in particular, has been linked to bph and incident, aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. the metabolic syndrome has also been shown to be associated with nonprostatic urological conditions such as male hypogonadism, nephrolithiasis, overactive bladder and erectile dysfunction, although data on these conditions are still sparse. overall, the results of studies on urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome seem to indicate that bph and prostate cancer could be regarded as two new aspects of the metabolic syndrome, and that an increased insulin level is a common underlying aberration that promotes both bph and clinical prostate cancer. urologists need to be aware of the effect that the metabolic syndrome has on urological disorders and should transfer this knowledge to their patients.

@background expression profile of androgen-modulated micrornas in the fetal murine lung aberrant wnt signalling promotes oncogenesis by increasing the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin to activate downstream target genes. however, the mechanism of β-catenin recruitment to the wnt target-gene promoter, a critical step for removing the co-repressor complex, is largely unknown. here, we report that transducin β-like protein 1 (tbl1) and its highly related family member tblr1 were required for wnt–β-catenin-mediated transcription. wnt signalling induced the interaction between β-catenin and tbl1–tblr1, as well as their binding to wnt target genes. importantly, the recruitment of tbl1–tblr1 and β-catenin to wnt target-gene promoters was mutually dependent on each other. furthermore, the depletion of tbl1–tblr1 significantly inhibited wnt–β-catenin-induced gene expression and oncogenic growth in vitro and in vivo. our results unravel two new components required for nuclear β-catenin function, and have important implications in developing new strategies for inhibiting wnt–β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis.
@background convergent actions of iκb kinase β and protein kinase cδ modulate mrna stability through phosphorylation of 14-3-3β complexed with tristetraprolin tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to a family of ligands with an associated family of receptor proteins. the pleiotropic actions of tnf range from proliferative responses such as cell growth and differentiation, to inflammatory effects and the mediation of immune responses, to destructive cellular outcomes such as apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms. activated tnf receptors mediate the association of distinct adaptor proteins that regulate a variety of signalling processes including kinase or phosphatase activation, lipase stimulation, and protease induction. moreover, the cytokine regulates the activities of transcription factors, heterotrimeric or monomeric g-proteins and calcium ion homeostasis in order to orchestrate its cellular functions. this review addresses the structural basis of tnf signalling, the pathways employed with their cellular consequences, and focuses on the specific role played by each of the two tnf receptor isotypes, tnfr1 and tnfr2.
@background nuclear structures surrounding internal lamin invaginations the specificity of eukaryotic dna organization into loops fixed to the nuclear matrix/chromosomal scaffold has been studied for more than fifteen years. the results and conclusions of different authors remain, however, controversial. recently, we have elaborated a new approach to the study of chromosomal dna loops. instead of characterizing loop basements (nuclear matrix dna), we have concentrated our efforts on the characterization of individual loops after their excision by dna topoisomerase ii‐mediated dna cleavage at matrix attachment sites. in this review the results of applying this mapping approach are compared with the results and conclusions from studies of nuclear matrix dna. an attempt is also made to reconsider all data about the specificity of dna interactions with the nuclear matrix and to suggest a model of spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome which resolves apparent contradictions between these data.

@background relationship between vitamin d receptor bsmi and foki polymorphisms and anthropometric and biochemical parameters describing metabolic syndrome vitamin d receptor (vdr) polymorphism influences susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but the association with type 2 diabetes is not clear. we investigated the association between vdr polymorphism and type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in a community-based study of unrelated older adults without known diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test (75 g), plasma glucose and insulin measurement, homeostasis model assessment (homa), and vdr genotyping were performed. the distributions of genotype frequencies of apai, bsmi, and taqi polymorphism did not differ between persons with and without diabetes, but the frequency of aa genotype of apai polymorphism was marginally higher in persons with type 2 diabetes (p =.058). fasting plasma glucose (p <.05) and prevalence of glucose intolerance (p <.05) were significantly higher in nondiabetic persons with aa genotype compared with those with aa genotype. the bb genotype of bsmi polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance as assessed by homa after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (bmi), and calcium and vitamin d use in persons without diabetes (p <.05). our research suggests that apai polymorphism may be associated with glucose intolerance independent of defective insulin secretion and bsmi polymorphism with insulin resistance in a nondiabetic caucasian population.

@method an empirical study of gender differences in online gambling research and theory regarding the social facilitation effect generates the expectation that the presence of other gamblers (or co-actors) in a gaming venue is likely to intensify individual gambling behavior and magnify losses. fifty male and 66 female participants (116 total) played a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine with a fixed winning sequence, followed by an indefinite losing sequence. measures of the intensity of gambling behavior included the final payout (a direct measure of losses), average bet-size, number of trials played, and the speed of play. some participants received false feedback from the computer designed to suggest that other gamers in adjacent rooms were playing and sometimes winning at the same game. persons who received both sight and sound information, including winning bells and instant messages regarding the wins of other (fake) players, placed more bets and lost more money compared to the other conditions with less information.
@method modelling breeding habitat preferences of bonelli’s eagle (hieraaetus fasciatus) in relation to topography, disturbance, climate and land use at different spatial scales 1. to develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. this is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low   abundance. in south-western victoria, australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. in order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. a predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal. 2. habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. coupled with geographic information system (gis) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat. 3. models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both gis data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. a multimodel inference approach based on akaike’s information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a gis to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. the predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (roc) technique. a hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. 4. negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and  increasing elevation, 'distance to cree', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. a positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation. 5. the predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0·97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant  independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. the proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a ≥0·5 level ) was 16%. 6. synthesis and applications. the spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. a multi-scale  approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a gis, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.
@result neural correlates of control operations in inverse priming with relevant and irrelevant masks masked stimuli (primes) can affect the preparation of a motor response to subsequently presented target stimuli. reactions to the target can be facilitated (straight priming) or inhibited (inverse priming) when preceded by a compatible prime (calling for the same response) and also when preceded by an incompatible prime. several hypotheses are currently under debate. these are the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis, the object-updating (ou) hypothesis, and mask-triggered inhibition (mti) hypothesis. all assume that the initial activation of the motor response is elicited by the prime according to its identity. this activation inevitably leads to straight priming in some cases and the mechanisms involved are undisputed. the hypotheses differ, however, as to why inverse priming occurs. the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis assumes that the motor activation elicited by a prime is automatically followed by an inhibition phase, leading to inverse priming if three conditions are fulfilled: perceptual evidence for the prime has to be sufficiently strong, it has to be immediately removed by the mask, and the delay between the prime and target has to be long enough for inhibition to become effective. the object-updating (ou) hypothesis assumes that inverse priming is triggered by the mask, provided that it contains features calling for the alternative response (i.e. the one contrasting with the response induced by the prime). the mti hypothesis assumes that the inhibitory phase is triggered by each successive stimulus which does not support the perceptual hypothesis provided by the prime. based mostly on our own experiments, we argue that (1) attempts to manipulate the three factors required by the si hypothesis imply changes of other variables and that (2) indeed, other variables seem to affect priming: prime-mask perceptual interaction and temporal position of the mask. these observations are in favor of the mti hypothesis. a limiting factor for all three hypotheses is that inverse priming is larger for arrows than for other shapes, making it doubtful as to what extent the majority of studies on inverse priming, due to their use of arrows, can be generalized to other stimuli.
@background probabilistic reinforcement learning in adults with autism spectrum disorders we used event-related fmri to identify the brain regions engaged during explicit and implicit sequence learning (esl and isl, respectively). twenty-four subjects performed a concurrent esl and isl task. behavior showed learning in both conditions. prefrontal (pfc), striatal, anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and visual regions (v1, v2 and v3) were engaged during both esl and isl. with esl there was increased activity in the visual regions on the predictable (i.e. learned pattern) trials. with isl, however, there was a relative decrease in activity in visual regions. the opposite patterns in the visual regions highlight the different effects of esl and isl. the learning process was distinguished from the result of learning, by fitting subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging data to their learning curve. this analysis revealed more extensive pfc activity during esl and caudal acc activity specific for the result of learning analysis, when the expected response was violated. our results suggest a relative dissociation of the brain regions engaged during esl and isl, whereby esl and isl can be viewed as partially distinct but overlapping parallel processes.
@method taxon richness of “megaviridae” exceeds those of bacteria and archaea in the ocean nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna viruses (ncldvs) constitute a group of eukaryotic viruses that can have crucial ecological roles in the sea by accelerating the turnover of their unicellular hosts or by causing diseases in animals. to better characterize the diversity, abundance and biogeography of marine ncldvs, we analyzed 17 metagenomes derived from microbial samples (0.2–1.6 μm size range) collected during the tara oceans expedition. the sample set includes ecosystems under-represented in previous studies, such as the arabian sea oxygen minimum zone (omz) and indian ocean lagoons. by combining computationally derived relative abundance and direct prokaryote cell counts, the abundance of ncldvs was found to be in the order of 104–105 genomes ml−1 for the samples from the photic zone and 102–103 genomes ml−1 for the omz. the megaviridae and phycodnaviridae dominated the ncldv populations in the metagenomes, although most of the reads classified in these families showed large divergence from known viral genomes. our taxon co-occurrence analysis revealed a potential association between viruses of the megaviridae family and eukaryotes related to oomycetes. in support of this predicted association, we identified six cases of lateral gene transfer between megaviridae and oomycetes. our results suggest that marine ncldvs probably outnumber eukaryotic organisms in the photic layer (per given water mass) and that metagenomic sequence analyses promise to shed new light on the biodiversity of marine viruses and their interactions with potential hosts.
@background prevalence and optimal management strategy for aortic regurgitation in tetralogy of fallot. five patients with tetralogy of fallot associated with aortic insufficiency were studied. they ranged from 6 to 34 years old (mean, 14 years), and 2 patients had a history of subacute bacterial endocarditis. four patients had a bulboventricular type of ventricular septal defect. prolapse of the right coronary cusp was the main cause of aortic insufficiency. deformed valve secondary to subacute bacterial endocarditis and severe dilatation of the aortic annulus were the other causes. in addition to repair of the tetralogy defect, aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 2 patients. in the remaining 3 patients, the ventricular septal defect was closed with a relatively small-sized patch and no aortotomy was made. four patients survived the operation, and no residual aortic insufficiency was observed in 3 of them. the etiology and the method of operation are discussed.

@background nociceptor-expressed ephrin-b2 regulates inflammatory and neuropathic pain the maintenance of bone homeostasis is tightly controlled, and largely dependent upon cellular communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and the coupling of bone resorption to bone formation. this tight coupling is essential for the correct function and maintenance of the skeletal system, repairing microscopic skeletal damage and replacing aged bone. a range of pathologic diseases, including osteoporosis and cancer-induced bone disease, disrupt this coupling and cause subsequent alterations in bone homeostasis. eph receptors and their associated ligands, ephrins, play critical roles in a number of cellular processes including immune regulation, neuronal development and cancer metastasis. eph receptors are also expressed by cells found within the bone marrow microenvironment, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and there is increasing evidence to implicate this family of receptors in the control of normal and pathological bone remodeling.
@background intrinsic laryngeal muscle activity in response to autonomic nervous system activation background in companion studies on canine and rodent laryngeal muscle, we observed that (1) muscle fibers in both the canine and rodent posterior cricoarytenoid (pca) muscles have a slower myosin heavy-chain (myhc) isoform profile than those in the thyroarytenoid (ta) muscle; (2) the muscle fiber composition of pca and ta muscles in canines and rodents is complex given the presence of so-called hybrid fibers (fibers coexpressing various combinations of myhc isoforms); (3) the types and proportions of hybrid fibers are both muscle specific and, in some cases, region specific; and (4) the myhc isoform profile of canine laryngeal muscle appears to be slower than that of rodent laryngeal muscle, suggesting the possibility that larger mammals have a slower myhc isoform profile.   objectives given the findings of these companion studies and the fact that very little is known about the myhc isoform composition of laryngeal muscle fibers, the primary objectives of this study were to determine (1) the types of myhc isoforms found in the human pca and ta muscles, (2) if there were regional differences in myhc isoform composition, (3) if hybrid fibers commonly occur in human laryngeal muscle, and (4) if the myhc isoform profile of human laryngeal muscle is slower than that of canine and rodent laryngeal muscle.   results and conclusions the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that both the pca and ta muscles in humans express 3 types of myhc isoforms (ie, slow type i, fast type iia, and fast type iix myhc isoforms). at the single-fiber level, there were distinct regional differences and hybrid fibers were a common occurrence. finally, the data demonstrate that the pca and ta muscles of humans have a slower myhc profile than that found in either canine or rodent laryngeal muscle.
@background deletion of irs2 reduces amyloid deposition and rescues behavioural deficits in app transgenic mice alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid β-peptide (a-beta) in the brain. transthyretin (ttr) is a tetrameric protein of about 55 kda mainly produced in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain. the known physiological functions of ttr are the transport of thyroid hormone t4 and retinol, through binding to the retinol binding protein. ttr has also been established as a cryptic protease able to cleave apoa-i in vitro. it has been described that ttr is involved in preventing a-beta fibrilization, both by inhibiting and disrupting a-beta fibrils, with consequent abrogation of toxicity. we further characterized the nature of the ttr/a-beta interaction and found that ttr, both recombinant or isolated from human sera, was able to proteolytically process a-beta, cleaving the peptide after aminoacid residues 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 14,16, 19 and 27, as determined by mass spectrometry, and reversed phase chromatography followed by n-terminal sequencing. a-beta peptides (1–14) and (15–42) showed lower amyloidogenic potential than the full length counterpart, as assessed by thioflavin binding assay and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. a-beta cleavage by ttr was inhibited in the presence of an αapp peptide containing the kunitz protease inhibitor (kpi) domain but not in the presence of the secreted αapp derived from the app isoform 695 without the kpi domain. ttr was also able to degrade aggregated forms of a-beta peptide. our results confirmed ttr as a protective molecule in ad, and prompted a-beta proteolysis by ttr as a protective mechanism in this disease. ttr may prove to be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque formation implicated in ad pathology.

@method negotiating and effectuating relocation to sheltered housing in old age: a swedish study over 11 years background and aims: in order to investigate the relation between personal functional capacity and the physical housing environment during the aging process, the aim of this study was to give a long-term description of person-environmental fit (p-e fit) problems in terms of housing accessibility and adl dependence among older adults, and to study their relationships at three points in time. methods: a 10-year longitudinal design was used: baseline (1994), follow-up 1 (2000) and follow-up 2 (2004). using the swedish national population register, a baseline sample of persons aged 75–84 years was identified. of the 133 participants at baseline, the 31 participants still available at follow-up 2 were included in this study. data on housing accessibility, functional limitations and dependence in adl were collected by means of interviews and observations at home visits. results: p-e fit problems increased significantly between baseline and follow-up 1 and between follow-ups 1 and 2. no significant changes in overall adl dependence were recorded. the total number of functional limitations, dependence on walking aids and p-e fit were significantly correlated to adl dependence, at both follow-up 1 and follow-up 2, but not at baseline. conclusions: results confirm that functional decline is a major driver toward increased adl dependence during the aging process, whereas environmental barriers per se are not related to such disability. instead, p-e fit is significantly related to adl dependence, and the relationship grows stronger with advancing age.
@background ets-1 is a transcriptional mediator of oncogenic nitric oxide signaling in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer no produced in tumors can either positively or negatively regulate growth. to examine this dichotomy, effects of no concentration and duration on the posttranslational regulation of several key proteins were examined in human breast mcf7 cells under aerobic conditions. we found that different concentration thresholds of no appear to elicit a discrete set of signal transduction pathways. at low steady-state concentrations of no (<50 nm), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) phosphorylation was induced via a guanylate cyclase-dependent mechanism. hypoxic inducible factor 1α (hif-1α) accumulation was associated with an intermediate amount of no (>100 nm), whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation occurred at considerably higher levels (>300 nm). erk phosphorylation was transient during no exposure. hif-1α stabilization paralleled the presence of no, whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation was detected during, and persisted after, no exposure. the dose-dependent effects of synthetic no donors were mimicked by activated macrophages cocultured with mcf7 cells at varying ratios. erk and hif-1α activation was similar in breast cancer cell lines either mutant (mb231) or null (mb157) in p53. the stabilization of hif-1α by no was not observed with increased mcf7 cell density, demonstrating the interrelationship between no and o2 consumption. the findings show that concentration and duration of no exposure are critical determinants in the regulation of tumor-related proteins.
@background bayesian spatial quantile regression with scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through markov chain monte carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. however, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. this computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. it is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. with regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). the latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. we discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. we also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.
@background a chrna5 smoking risk variant decreases the aversive effects of nicotine in humans objectiveallelic variation in the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) subunit gene, chrna5, increases vulnerability to tobacco addiction. here, we investigated the role of α5* nachrs in the effects of nicotine on brain reward systems.materials and methodseffects of acute (0.03125–0.5 mg/kg sc) or chronic (24 mg/kg per day; osmotic minipump) nicotine and mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal on intracranial self-stimulation (icss) thresholds were assessed in wild-type and α5 nachr subunit knockout mice. noxious effects of nicotine were further investigated using a conditioned taste aversion procedure.resultslower nicotine doses (0.03125–0.125 mg/kg) decreased icss thresholds in wild-type and α5 knockout mice. at higher doses (0.25–0.5 mg/kg), threshold-lowering effects of nicotine were diminished in wild-type mice, whereas nicotine lowered thresholds across all doses tested in α5 knockout mice. nicotine (1.5 mg/kg) conditioned a taste aversion to saccharine equally in both genotypes. mecamylamine (5 mg/kg) elevated icss thresholds by a similar magnitude in wild-type and α5 knockout mice prepared with minipumps delivering nicotine. unexpectedly, mecamylamine also elevated thresholds in saline-treated α5 knockout mice.conclusionα5* nachrs are not involved in reward-enhancing effects of lower nicotine doses, the reward-inhibiting effects of nicotine withdrawal, or the general noxious effects of higher nicotine doses. instead, α5* nachrs regulate the reward-inhibiting effects nicotine doses that oppose the reward-facilitating effects of the drug. these data suggest that disruption of α5* nachr signaling greatly expands the range of nicotine doses that facilitate brain reward activity, which may help explain the increased tobacco addiction vulnerability associated with chrna5 risk alleles.
@background a technique for high-throughput protein crystallization in ionically cross-linked polysaccharide gel beads for x-ray diffraction experiments the introduction of electrostatic layer-by-layer (lbl) self-assembly has shown broad biomedical applications in thin film coating, micropatterning, nanobioreactors, artificial cells, and drug delivery systems. multiple assembly polyelectrolytes and proteins are based on electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged layers. the film architecture is precisely designed and can be controlled to 1-nm precision with a range from 5 to 1000 nm. thin films can be deposited on any surface including many widely used biomaterials. microencapsulation of micro/nanotemplates with multilayers enabled cell surface modification, controlled drug release, hollow shell formation, and nanobioreactors. both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate potential applications in biology, pharmaceutics, medicine, and other biomedical areas.
@background the ca2+ channel inhibitor 2‐apb reverses β‐amyloid‐induced ltp deficit in hippocampus by blocking bax and caspase‐3 hyperactivation beta amyloid (abeta), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein (app) by neurons, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of alzheimer's disease. recent studies indicate that this peptide can drive loss of surface ampa and nmda type glutamate receptors. we now show that abeta employs signaling pathways of long-term depression (ltd) to drive endocytosis of synaptic ampa receptors. synaptic removal of ampa receptors is necessary and sufficient to produce loss of dendritic spines and synaptic nmda responses. our studies indicate the central role played by ampa receptor trafficking in abeta-induced modification of synaptic structure and function.
@background comparison of endodontic retreatment in teeth obturated with resilon or gutta-percha: a review of literature objective retreatment of a root canal in the case of infection requires complete removal of previous filling material. this study evaluated the efficacy of 3 techniques in removing laterally compacted resilon/epiphany and gutta-percha/ah plus from straight and curved canals during retreatment.   materials and methods extracted human teeth (90 maxillary anterior teeth with single,straight root canals and 90 mandibular molars with mesial canal root curvatures of 20 degrees to 35 degrees ) were divided into 6 groups each consisting of 15 straight and 15 curved root canals. three groups were obturated using gutta-percha/ah plus and 3 were obturated with resilon/epiphany. after 3 weeks storage at 37 degrees c and 100% humidity, all root canal fillings were removed using a gates glidden drill, a gates glidden drill plus chloroform or a system b device.   results for all removal techniques, specimens obturated with gutta-percha/ah plus showed significantly more remnants of obturation material than specimens filled with resilon/epiphany for both straight and curved canals (p < 0.05). removal time was shorter for resilon/epiphany than gutta-percha/ah plus filling for all techniques and for both curved and straight canals. the gates glidden drill and gates glidden drill plus chloroform removal techniques were significantly faster than the system b technique for both straight and curved canals. the gates glidden drill technique was best for straight canals, whereas the gates glidden drill plus chloroform was the best technique for curved canals when removing resilon/epiphany sealer.   conclusions removal of resilon/epiphany filling resulted in fewer remnants and was faster than gutta-percha/ah plus removal using a gates glidden drill with or without chloroform in both straight and curved canals.
@method the role of local backrub motions in evolved and designed mutations geometrical validation around the cα is described, with a new cβ measure and updated ramachandran plot. deviation of the observed cβ atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure‐validation information contained in bond angle distortions. cβ deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. a new ϕ,ψ plot using density‐dependent smoothing for 81,234 non‐gly, non‐pro, and non‐prepro residues with b < 30 from 500 high‐resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. one such region is the γ‐turn conformation near +75°,−60°, counted as forbidden by common structure‐validation programs; however, it occurs in well‐ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the γ‐turn h‐bond. favored and allowed ϕ,ψ regions are also defined for pro, pre‐pro, and gly (important because gly ϕ,ψ angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of α‐helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. a proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two‐peptide nhs permits donating only a single h‐bond. new calculations by hu et al.

@background relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
@method treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection with orally active fimh inhibitors fimbriae are proteinogeneous appendages on the surface of bacteria, which mediate bacterial adhesion to the host cell glycocalyx. the so-called type 1 fimbriae exhibit specificity for alpha-d-mannosides and, therefore, they are assumed to mediate bacterial adhesion via the interaction of a fimbrial lectin and alpha-d-mannosyl residues exposed on the host cell surface. this carbohydrate-specific adhesive protein subunit of type 1 fimbriae has been identified as a protein called fimh. the crystal structure of this lectin is known and, based on this information, the molecular details of the interaction of mannoside ligands and fimh are addressed in this paper. computer-based docking methods were used to evaluate known ligands as well as to design new ones. then, a series of new mannosides with extended aglycon was synthesized and tested as inhibitors of type 1 fimbriae-mediated bacterial adhesion in an elisa. the results obtained were compared to the predictions and findings as delivered by molecular modeling. this study led to an improved understanding of the ligand-receptor interactions under investigation.
@background autophosphorylation of ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated is regulated by protein phosphatase 2a dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) is a complex of dna-pk catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs) and the dna end-binding ku70/ku80 heterodimer. dna-pk is required for dna double strand break repair by the process of nonhomologous end joining. nonhomologous end joining is a major mechanism for the repair of dna double strand breaks in mammalian cells. as such, dna-pk plays essential roles in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and in v(d)j recombination. in vitro, dna-pk undergoes phosphorylation of all three protein subunits (dna-pk catalytic subunit, ku70 and ku80) and phosphorylation correlates with inactivation of the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of dna-pk. here we show that phosphorylation-induced loss of the protein kinase activity of dna-pk is restored by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) and that this reactivation is blocked by the potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin. we also show that treating human lymphoblastoid cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin, at pp2a-selective concentrations, causes a 50–60% decrease in dna-pk protein kinase activity, although the protein phosphatase 1 activity in these cells was unaffected. in vivo phosphorylation of dna-pkcs, ku70, and ku80 was observed when cells were labeled with [32p]inorganic phosphate in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. together, our data suggest that reversible protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the regulation of dna-pk protein kinase activity and that the protein phosphatase responsible for reactivation in vivo is a pp2a-like enzyme.
@background computer-aided designed, three dimensional-printed hemipelvic prosthesis for peri-acetabular malignant bone tumour five children with pelvic ewing's sarcoma whose age was 6-10 years underwent reconstruction after resection of the tumor. one child with a tumor of the ilium underwent an iliosacral arthrodesis with allograft. three patients underwent a hip transposition after the resection of the ilium and the upper part of the acetabulum. one patient underwent no skeletal reconstruction after the resection of the acetabulum and the ilium. two children are alive 96 and 60 months after surgery; however, two died 12 and 21 months after surgery of metastasis, and one is alive with metastasis 15 months after surgery. functional evaluation was possible in four patients: one is excellent, and three are fair. after resection of the ilium, including the upper part of the acetabulum, a hip transposition can be selected. if all the acetabulum is resected, it will be optimal not to do a bony reconstruction.
@background kinetics of cellobiohydrolase ( cel 7 a ) variants with lowered substrate despite intensive research, the mechanism of the rapid retardation in the rates of cellobiohydrolase (cbh) catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis is still not clear. interpretation of the hydrolysis data has been complicated by the inability to measure the catalytic constants for cbh‐s acting on cellulose. we developed a method for measuring the observed catalytic constant (kobs) for cbh catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis. it relies on in situ measurement of the concentration of cbh with the active site occupied by the cellulose chain. for that we followed the specific inhibition of the hydrolysis of para‐nitrophenyl‐β‐d‐lactoside by cellulose. the method was applied to cbh‐s trcel7a from trichoderma reesei and pccel7d from phanerochaete chrysosporium and their isolated catalytic domains. bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, avicel, amorphous cellulose, and lignocellulose were used as substrates. a rapid decrease of kobs in time was observed on all substrates. the kobs values for pccel7d were about 1.5 times higher than those for trcel7a. in case of both trcel7a and pccel7d, the kobs values for catalytic domains were similar to those for intact enzymes. a model where cbh action is limited by the average length of obstacle‐free way on cellulose chain is proposed. once formed, productive cbh–cellulose complex proceeds with a constant rate determined by the true catalytic constant. after encountering an obstacle cbh will “get stuck” and the rate of further cellulose hydrolysis will be governed by the dissociation rate constant (koff), which is low for processive cbh‐s. biotechnol. bioeng. 2010;106: 871–883. © 2010 wiley periodicals, inc.
@background childhood autism and auditory system abnormalities. the structure of the planum temporale is often disturbed in disorders with associated communication problems, particularly in auditory and language processing areas in the brain. we hypothesized that people with autism would have reduced left hemisphere volumes in the planum temporale, a language related brain structure. we performed magnetic resonance imaging scans of 15 adults with autistic disorder and 15 comparison subjects, and measured the volume of gray matter in the planum temporale and heschl's gyrus (hg) in both hemispheres. planum temporale volume reduced in the left hemisphere of the autism group (p<0.003). no differences in hg volumes were observed between the two groups. the volume reduction seen in the left hemisphere of the autism group may suggest an early neurodevelopmental disturbance in autism that impacts language development.
@background p19(arf) deficiency reduces macrophage and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and aggravates atherosclerosis. coronary heart disease (chd) is a major cause of death in western countries. we used genome-wide association scanning to identify a 58-kilobase interval on chromosome 9p21 that was consistently associated with chd in six independent samples (more than 23,000 participants) from four caucasian populations. this interval, which is located near the cdkn2a and cdkn2b genes, contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established chd risk factors such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension, or diabetes. homozygotes for the risk allele make up 20 to 25% of caucasians and have a approximately 30 to 40% increased risk of chd.
@method the competence gene, comf, from synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 is involved in natural transformation, phototactic motility and piliation. proteins from silver-stained gels can be digested enzymatically and the resulting peptide analyzed and sequenced by mass spectrometry. standard proteins yield the same peptide maps when extracted from coomassie- and silver-stained gels, as judged by electrospray and maldi mass spectrometry. the low nanogram range can be reached by the protocols described here, and the method is robust. a silver-stained one-dimensional gel of a fraction from yeast proteins was analyzed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. in the sequencing, more than 1000 amino acids were covered, resulting in no evidence of chemical modifications due to the silver staining procedure. silver staining allows a substantial shortening of sample preparation time and may, therefore, be preferable over coomassie staining. this work removes a major obstacle to the low-level sequence analysis of proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels.
@background expression and requirement of t-box transcription factors tbx2 and tbx3 during secondary palate development in the mouse. ephs and ephrins are cell surface receptors that bind to each other and initiate distinct, bidirectional signalling pathways in processes known as forward (eph) and reverse (ephrin) signalling. previous work had shown that the loss of ephrinb1 protein alone or compound loss of ephb2 and ephb3 leads to cleft palate. because of the bidirectional signalling capability of these molecules, it was not clear whether forward or reverse signalling caused the cleft palate in the ephrinb1 protein null or ephb2 and ephb3 compound null mice. we demonstrate that forward signalling is essential for palatogenesis. foetuses with a cytoplasmically truncated ephb2 protein, which could initiate reverse but not forward signalling, and were protein null for ephb3 had a cleft palate. this happened because their palatal shelves, which could elevate in vivo and adhere and fuse in culture, were too small to contact one another. small shelf size was due to reduced proliferation in the palatal mesenchyme. the reduced proliferation was not the result of abnormal vascular development within the palate. in conclusion, strong evidence is provided for specific and co-operative roles of ephb2 and ephb3 in palate development.
@background varcards: an integrated genetic and clinical database for coding variants in the human genome dna sequencing technologies continue to make progress in increased throughput and quality, and decreased cost. as we transition from whole exome capture sequencing to whole genome sequencing (wgs), our ability to convert machine-generated variant calls, including single nucleotide variant (snv) and insertion-deletion variants (indels), into human-interpretable knowledge has lagged far behind the ability to obtain enormous amounts of variants. to help narrow this gap, here we present wgsa (wgs annotator), a functional annotation pipeline for human genome sequencing studies, which is runnable out of the box on the amazon compute cloud and is freely downloadable at (https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/wgsa/).  functional annotation is a key step in wgs analysis. in one way, annotation helps the analyst filter to a subset of elements of particular interest (eg, cell type specific enhancers), in another way annotation helps the investigators to increase the power of identifying phenotype-associated loci (eg, association test using functional prediction score as a weight) and interpret potentially interesting findings. currently, there are several popular gene model based annotation tools, including annovar,1 snpeff2 and the ensembl variant effect predictor (vep).3 these can annotate a variety of protein coding and non-coding gene models from a range of species. it is well known among practitioners that different databases (eg, refseq4 and ensembl5) use different models for …
@result psychiatric comorbidity in cocaine users treated in therapeutic community: substance-induced versus independent disorders the authors explored the relationship between social phobia and cocaine dependence in 158 individuals entering a pharmacologic treatment trial for cocaine dependence. twenty-two patients met dsm-iii-r criteria for social phobia. the social phobia group was compared with 22 age- and sex-matched cocaine-dependent control subjects. those with social phobia and cocaine dependence were more likely to have additional psychiatric diagnoses and greater symptom severity, more likely to be polysubstance users, and more likely to have developed alcohol dependence at an early age. the authors discuss treatment implications of these data.
@method calmodulin and protein kinase c regulate gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells. churchill, grant c., monica m. lurtz, and charles f. louis. ca21 regulation of gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells. am j physiol cell physiol 281: c972–c981, 2001.—the quantitative effects of ca21 signaling on gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells have been determined using either the spread of mn21 that is imaged by its ability to quench the fluorescence of fura 2 or the spread of the fluorescent dye alexa fluor 594. gap junctional coupling was unaffected by a mechanically stimulated cell-to-cell ca21 wave. furthermore, when cytosolic ca21 concentration (cai ) increased after the addition of the agonist atp, coupling was unaffected during the period that cai 21 was maximal. however, coupling decreased transiently ;5–10 min after agonist addition when cai 21 returned to resting levels, indicating that this transient decrease in coupling was unlikely due to a direct action of cai 21 on gap junctions. an increase in cai 21 mediated by the ionophore ionomycin that was sustained for several minutes resulted in a more rapid and sustained decrease in coupling (ic50 ;300 nm ca21, hill coefficient of 4), indicating that an increase in cai 21 alone could regulate gap junctions. thus cai 21 increases that occurred during agonist stimulation and cell-to-cell ca21 waves were too transient to mediate a sustained uncoupling of lens epithelial cells.

@background building a robust tumor profiling program: synergy between next-generation sequencing and targeted single-gene testing context the higher throughput and lower per-base cost of next-generation sequencing (ngs) as compared to sanger sequencing has led to its rapid adoption in clinical testing. the number of laboratories offering ngs-based tests has also grown considerably in the past few years, despite the fact that specific clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988/college of american pathologists (cap) laboratory standards had not yet been developed to regulate this technology.   objective to develop a checklist for clinical testing using ngs technology that sets standards for the analytic wet bench process and for bioinformatics or "dry bench" analyses. as ngs-based clinical tests are new to diagnostic testing and are of much greater complexity than traditional sanger sequencing-based tests, there is an urgent need to develop new regulatory standards for laboratories offering these tests.   design to develop the necessary regulatory framework for ngs and to facilitate appropriate adoption of this technology for clinical testing, cap formed a committee in 2011, the ngs work group, to deliberate upon the contents to be included in the checklist. results . -a total of 18 laboratory accreditation checklist requirements for the analytic wet bench process and bioinformatics analysis processes have been included within cap's molecular pathology checklist (mol).   conclusions this report describes the important issues considered by the cap committee during the development of the new checklist requirements, which address documentation, validation, quality assurance, confirmatory testing, exception logs, monitoring of upgrades, variant interpretation and reporting, incidental findings, data storage, version traceability, and data transfer confidentiality.
@result a comparative in vitro efficacy of conventional rotatory and chemomechanical caries removal: influence on cariogenic flora, microhardness, and residual composition objectives the usage of minimally invasive procedures and attention to patient comfort are of great importance, especially for dental treatment in small children. this has led to the development of chemomechanical methods for caries removal. the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of chemomechanical caries removal with that of conventional excavation in reducing the count of the cariogenic flora.   design and setting subjects for this study were chosen from children admitted to dental clinic for restorative procedures under general anaesthesia.   samples and methods twenty-one children (mean age 43.5 +/- 12.0 months) with early childhood caries were included in this study. two primary teeth with comparable degrees of carious destruction were chosen in each child (n = 42) for caries removal with carisolv' or by means of rotary instruments. samples from carious dentine were taken with a sterile scraping instrument, then all softened dentine was removed and a second sample was taken. all samples (n = 84) were serially diluted and plated on two different nutrient agar plates.   results after 24 h of incubation, colony forming units were determined for total bacterial counts and lactobacilli. twelve per cent of the samples from carious dentine contained more than 10(6) bacteria, 23.8% contained more than 10(5) lactobacilli. both methods of caries removal produced a statistically significant reduction in the bacterial counts (p = 0.0001). in at least 90.5% of the samples taken after the removal, the total bacterial count was below 10(2), and in 95.2% lactobacilli fell below 10(2).   conclusion these results indicate that the efficacy of chemomechanical removal of carious dentine in children by means of carisolv' is comparable to the results obtained by conventional methods, and thus might serve as a suitable alternative.
@method predicting rna-protein interactions using only sequence information the protein–rna interface database (pridb) is a comprehensive database of protein–rna interfaces extracted from complexes in the protein data bank (pdb). it is designed to facilitate detailed analyses of individual protein–rna complexes and their interfaces, in addition to automated generation of user-defined data sets of protein–rna interfaces for statistical analyses and machine learning applications. for any chosen pdb complex or list of complexes, pridb rapidly displays interfacial amino acids and ribonucleotides within the primary sequences of the interacting protein and rna chains. pridb also identifies prosite motifs in protein chains and fr3d motifs in rna chains and provides links to these external databases, as well as to structure files in the pdb. an integrated jmol applet is provided for visualization of interacting atoms and residues in the context of the 3d complex structures. the current version of pridb contains structural information regarding 926 protein–rna complexes available in the pdb (as of 10 october 2010). atomic- and residue-level contact information for the entire data set can be downloaded in a simple machine-readable format. also, several non-redundant benchmark data sets of protein–rna complexes are provided. the pridb database is freely available online at http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/pridb.
@background isolation and characterization of phages infecting bacillus subtilis prokaryote viruses include 14 officially accepted families and at least five other potential families awaiting classification. approximately 5,500 prokaryote viruses have been examined in the electron microscope. classification has a predictive value and is invaluable to control experimental techniques and results. in describing viruses, the choice of methods depends on structure and taxonomical position of viruses. the study of isometric, filamentous, and pleomorphic viruses requires more detailed investigations than that of tailed species.
@method simultaneous multiphase image segmentation and cartoon-texture decomposition we present a new variational model for the soft multiphase image segmentation. in the model, we introduce a nonconvex regularizer on the membership functions which are used as indicators of different homogeneous regions. the nonconvex regularizer performs better than the usual convex ones in that (i) it well preserves geometric shapes of the homogeneous regions, and (ii) it protects edges from oversmoothing which is a common drawback of the convex regularizer. to solve the nonconvex minimization problem, we design a new fast alternative iteration algorithm, which is robust to the setting of the parameters in the model. we conduct comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the algorithm in terms of visual evaluation and a variety of quantitative indices for image segmentation. the algorithm achieves more accurate results compared to other well-known convex variational methods for image segmentation.
@background chlorhexidine and alcohol versus povidone-iodine for antisepsis in gynecological surgery. objective the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine for cleansing the operative field for vaginal surgery.   study design this was a randomized controlled trial that compared 10% povidone iodine and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate as surgical scrubs. our primary end point was the proportion of contaminated specimens (defined as total bacterial colony counts of >/=5000 colony-forming units) per group found throughout the surgical procedures. all patients received standard infection prophylaxis that included preoperative intravenous antibiotics. immediately before antibiotic administration and baseline aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the vaginal flora were obtained, which were followed by cultures at 30 minutes after the surgical scrub and hourly thereafter throughout each patient's surgery.   results a total of 50 patients were enrolled between october 2002 and september 2003. there were no differences between the povidone iodine (n = 27) and chlorhexidine (n = 23) groups with respect to age, race, exogenous hormone use, body mass index, gravity, parity, preoperative mean colony counts, or operative time. among the first set of intraoperative specimens (which were obtained 30 minutes after the surgical scrub), 63% of the cultures (17/27) from the povidone iodine group and 22% of the cultures (5/23) from the chlorhexidine group were classified as contaminated ( p = .003; relative risk, 6.12; 95% ci, 1.7, 21.6). subsequent cultures failed to demonstrate significant differences.   conclusion chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than povidone iodine in decreasing the bacterial colony counts that were found in the operative field for vaginal hysterectomy.
@background intention to use mobile customer relationship management systems this research represents a theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model (tam), which is researchers have used to explain technologies’ perceived usefulness and individuals intention to use it. the authors developed a model, referred to as the mobile wireless technology acceptance model (mwtam), to test the relationship between theoretical constructs spanning technological influence processes (perceived ubiquity, and perceived reachability) and cognitive influence processes (job relevance, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) and their impact on behavioral intention. mwtam is assessed using data collected from an online survey and analyzed using amos 5.0. results provide evidence to support mwtam as both the technological and cognitive influence processes accounted for 58.7% of the variance explained in an individual’s behavioral intention toward using mobile wireless technology. additionally, the path coefficients between constructs ranged from 0.241 to 0.572 providing further evidence to support the theoretical extension of tam.
@result association between the g.296596g > a genetic variant of reln gene and susceptibility to autism in a chinese han population autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with severe cognitive and communication disabilities, that has a strong genetic predisposition.1 reelin, a protein involved in neuronal migration during development, is encoded by a gene located on 7q22,2 within the candidate region on 7q showing increased allele sharing in previous genome scans.3–8 a case/control and family-based association study recently reported a positive association between a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (ggc) located in the 5′ untranslated region (utr) of the reelin gene and autism.9 we performed a transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) analysis of the 5′utr polymorphism in 167 families including 218 affected subjects (117 trios and 50 affected sib pairs) and found no evidence of linkage/association. our results do not support previous findings and suggest that this ggc polymorphism of the reelin gene is unlikely to be a major susceptibility factor in autism and/or genetic heterogeneity.
@background development of the human insular cortex: differentiation, proliferation, cell death, and appearance of 5ht-2a receptors stress- and drug-related cues are major factors contributing to high rates of relapse in addictive disorders. brain imaging studies have begun to identify neural correlates of stress and drug cue-induced craving states. findings indicate considerable overlap in neural circuits involved in processing stress and drug cues with activity in the corticostriatal limbic circuitry underlying both affective and reward processing. more recent efforts have begun to identify the relationships between neural activity during stress and drug cue exposure and drug relapse outcomes. findings suggest medial prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, striatal and posterior insula regions to be associated with relapse outcomes. altered function in these brain regions is associated with stress-induced and drug cue-induced craving states and an increased susceptibility to relapse. such alterations can serve as markers to identify relapse propensity and a more severe course of addiction. efficacy of pharmacological and behavioral treatments that specifically target stress and cue-induced craving and arousal responses may also be assessed via alterations in these brain correlates.
@background degradation of the separase-cleaved rec8, a meiotic cohesin subunit, by the n-end rule pathway* the n‐end rule relates the regulation of the in vivo half‐life of a protein to the identity of its n‐terminal residue. degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the n‐end rule pathway include a set called n‐degrons. the main determinant of an n‐degron is a destabilizing n‐terminal residue of a protein. in eukaryotes, the n‐end rule pathway is a part of the ubiquitin system and consists of two branches, the ac/n‐end rule and the arg/n‐end rule pathways. the ac/n‐end rule pathway targets proteins containing nα‐terminally acetylated (nt‐acetylated) residues. the arg/n‐end rule pathway recognizes unacetylated n‐terminal residues and involves n‐terminal arginylation. together, these branches target for degradation a majority of cellular proteins. for example, more than 80% of human proteins are cotranslationally nt‐acetylated. thus, most proteins harbor a specific degradation signal, termed acn‐degron, from the moment of their birth. specific n‐end rule pathways are also present in prokaryotes and in mitochondria. enzymes that produce n‐degrons include methionine‐aminopeptidases, caspases, calpains, nt‐acetylases, nt‐amidases, arginyl‐transferases, and leucyl‐transferases. regulated degradation of specific proteins by the n‐end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, oxygen, and nitric oxide; selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of dna repair, segregation, and condensation; the signaling by g proteins; the regulation of peptide import, fat metabolism, viral and bacterial infections, apoptosis, meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development; and the functioning of adult organs, including the pancreas and the brain. discovered 25 years ago, this pathway continues to be a fount of biological insights.
@background a gene encoding a new cold-active lipase from an antarctic isolate of penicilliumexpansum lipases are acyl hydrolases that play a key role in fat digestion by cleaving long-chain triglycerides into polar lipids. due to an opposite polarity between the enzyme (hydrophilic) and their substrates (lipophilic), lipase reaction occurs at the interface between the aqueous and the oil phases. hence, interfaces are the key spots for lipase biocatalysis and an appropriate site for modulating lipolysis. surprisingly enough, knowledge about the effects of the interfacial composition on lipase catalysis is still limited and only described by the term "interfacial quality". recent systematic studies based on a biophysical approach allowed for the first time to show the effects of the interfacial microenvironment on lipase catalysis. these studies demonstrate that lipase activity as a function of interfacial composition is more attributed to substrate inaccessibility rather than to enzyme denaturation or inactivation, as it is often hypothesized. a detailed analysis of the interfacial properties of all compounds involved in triglyceride digestion revealed that lipolysis is a self-regulated reaction. this feedback mechanism can be explored as a new avenue to control lipase catalysis. to substantiate this hypothesis, oil hydrolysis in a model gastro-intestinal system was performed, which can be seen as an interfacial engineering approach to enzyme reactivity control. the presented characterization of the interfacial composition and its consequences provide a new approach for the understanding of lipase reactions at interfaces with direct impact on biotechnological and health care applications.
@background modulating the vascular response to limb ischemia: angiogenic and cell therapies. background— embryonic stem (es) cells are distinguished by their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. here we characterize the differentiation of es cell–derived endothelial cells (esc-ecs), use molecular imaging techniques to examine their survival in vivo, and determine the therapeutic efficacy of esc-ecs for restoration of cardiac function after ischemic injury. methods and results— murine es cells were transfected with a construct composed of a vascular endothelial cadherin promoter driving enhanced green fluorescence protein (pve-cadherin-egfp). differentiation of es cells to ecs was detected by facs analysis using flk-1 (early ec marker at day 4) and ve-cadherin (late ec marker at day 8). after isolation, these esc-ecs express endothelial cell markers similar to adult mouse lung endothelial cells, form vascular-like channels, and incorporate dii-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (dii-ac-ldl). for in vivo imaging, es cells were transduced with an ubiquitin promoter driving firefly luciferase and monomeric red fluorescence protein (pub-fluc-mrfp). a robust correlation exists between fluc signals and cell numbers by ex vivo imaging analysis (r2=0.98) and by in vitro enzyme assay (r2=0.94). afterward, 5×105 esc-ecs or pbs (as control) was injected into the hearts of mice undergoing lad ligation (n=15 per group). bioluminescence imaging showed longitudinal survival of transplanted esc-ecs for ≈8 weeks. echocardiogram demonstrated significant functional improvement in the esc-ec group compared with control (p=0.04). finally, postmortem analysis confirmed increased presence of small capillaries and venules in the infarcted zones by cd31 staining. conclusions— this is the first study to track the fate and function of transplanted esc-ecs in the heart. with further validation, these esc-ecs could become a valuable source of cell therapy for induction of angiogenesis in the treatment of myocardial ischemia.
@background differentiating sct and inattentive symptoms in adhd using fmri measures of cognitive control objective directed attention, the ability to allocate and direct attention toward a salient stimulus, is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). this construct is often assessed with target detection or oddball tasks, and individuals with adhd perform poorly on such tasks. however, to date, the specific brain structures or neural mechanisms underlying target detection dysfunction in individuals with adhd have not been identified. the authors' goal was to investigate neural correlates of target detection dysfunction in adhd using event-related fmri.   method behavioral and brain activation data were collected while subjects performed a visual oddball task. participants included 14 right-handed male adolescents with adhd (combined type) and 12 typically developing age- and handedness-matched male comparison subjects.   results individuals with adhd made significantly more errors of commission than comparison subjects. further, relative to comparison subjects, individuals with adhd showed significantly less activation in the bilateral parietal lobes (including the superior parietal gyrus and supramarginal and angular gyri of the inferior parietal lobe), right precuneus, and thalamus.   conclusions adolescents with adhd demonstrated significant impairments in their ability to direct and allocate attentional resources. these difficulties were associated with significant aberrations in the parietal attentional system, which is known to play a significant role in attention shifting and detecting specific or salient targets. thus, dysfunction in the parietal attentional system may play a significant role in the behavioral phenotype of adhd.
@method clinical factors influencing the efficacy of systemic moxifloxacin in the therapy of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis: a multilevel analysis from a clinical trial aim the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin (mox) in one-stage scaling and root planing (srp) in treating generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp).   materials and methods forty subjects were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. the two treatment groups consisted of srp combined with systemically administered mox at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days or srp + placebo once daily for 7 days. subgingival plaque samples were analysed for cultivable bacteria.   results both groups resulted in significant reduction of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), and this difference was maintained at 6 months from baseline in both groups. however, subjects receiving mox showed the greatest improvements cal, and pd. subjects in both groups at 6 months displayed the greatest reduction from baseline in frequency of sites with pd ≥ 6 mm (p < 0.001), favouring the mox group. adjunctive antibiotic protocol reduced subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to undetectable levels, after 3 and 6 months, and there was a significant reduction in the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in the mox group compared to the placebo group.   conclusions the results from this study suggest that moxifloxacin as and adjunct to one-stage full-mouth srp leads to a better clinical and microbiological advantages compared to mechanical treatment.
@method a new approach to affordable and reliable cardiology pacs architecture using open-source technology the first interoperability demonstration of the cardiology profiles of the "integrating the healthcare enterprise" (ihe) initiative was held in conjunction with the annual scientific sessions of the american college of cardiology (acc) in march, 2005. the ihe cardiology planning committee identified clinical problems to be addressed: the ability to view an ecg from anywhere in the enterprise, and the effective integration of patient, order and procedure information for echocardiography and for cardiac catheterization. the ihe cardiology technical committee developed a set of integration profiles to address the retrieval and display of ecg's as well as scheduled and unscheduled echo and cath for registered and unregistered patients. the demonstration used clinical scenarios to demonstrate the integration of the participating systems: (1) emergent angioplasty (2) change of procedure room; (3) add-on mobile echo procedure; and (4) stress echo images
@background a new, simple, rapid test for detection of dnase activity of microorganisms: dnase tube test. some years ago a “desoxyribonuclease” was found’ in the culture medium of staphylococcus aureus that was unaffected by heating in a boiling-water bath. the enzyme has proved useful in end-group studies of desoxyribonucleic acids and fragments thereof, because the products of its action bear the singly esterified phosphate a t the 3’ position?, as was first pointed out by j. d. smith,4 ribonucleic acid is also attacked, again only a t the 5’ phosphodiester bond, giving rise to nucleoside 3‘-phosphates in addition to larger, homologous fragments. other similarities between the desoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease activities itre the unusual stability of the enzyme,” the ph optimum of 8.6; and the requirement for calcium ion’’ at about 0.01 &/i concentration. it appears that, when the enzyme is in the culture medium, it can digest extracellular nucleic acids5 which, in default of enzyme action, accumulate as part of a slime layer. the enzyme is salted out of the culture medium after boiling and washed with 2.5 per cent trichloroacetic acid saturated with ammonium chloride, followed by 83 per cent ethanol.’ since the washing is carried out at room temperature, any traces of relatively labile contaminating enzymes that survived the boiling probably would be destroyed. terminal digests of natural nucleic acids are complex mixtures (figure 1). the values, perhaps, match as well as could be expected in view of the initial base differences in the two substrates, except for a marked, unexplained discrepancy between guanylic acid and desoxyguanylic acid. end-group determinations2, 6 , showed that in several dinucleotidc fractions ;i single sequence accounted for 90 per cent or more of the material. the favored sequences were: desoxyadenylyl desoxycytidylic acid (apcp) and desoxyadenylyl desoxyguanylic acid (apgp) in both the desoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid digests, and desoxythymidylyl desoxycytidylic acid (tpcp) and desoxythymidylyl desoxyguanylic acid (tpgp) in the desoxyribonucleic acid digest; sequence was not determined in other ribodinucleotide fractions. however, both desoxythymidylyl desoxyadenylic acid (tpap) and desoxyadenylyl desoxythymidylic acid (aptp) were well represented (about two parts of the former to one of the latter). there are also trinucleotides or larger fragments that may contain any base of the original substrate. a possible clue to the reason for their presence in the digests is the fact that they are absent after digestion of certain synthetic polynucleotides (the only ones investigated so far) which lack cytosine, uracil, and guanine (figure 2). the experiment with polyadcnylic acid indicat etl t ha t the sequence apa must be both susceptible to cleavage (othcrwise there would be no digest ion)
@method learning to rank query suggestions for adhoc and diversity search the trec web track explores and evaluates web retrieval technology over large collections of web data. in its current incarnation, the web track has been active since trec 2009, where it included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task [4]. the goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. for trec 2010 the track introduced a new web spam task and web-style, six-level relevance assessment for the adhoc task [5]. for trec 2011, as recommended by participants at the track planning session held during trec 2010, we dropped the spam task but continued the other tasks essentially unchanged. as we did for trec 2009 and trec 2010, we based our trec 2011 experiments on the billion-page clueweb09 collection created by the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university. the tasks use a common topic set, differing only in their evaluation methodology. topics are created from the logs of a commercial search engine, with the aid of tools developed at microsoft research [9]. given a target query, these tools extract and analyze groups of related queries, using co-clicks and other information, to identify clusters of queries that highlight different aspects and interpretations of the target query. these clusters are employed by nist for topic development. each resulting topic is structured as a representative set of subtopics, each related to a different user need. the selection of subtopics attempts to reflect a mix of genuine user requirements for the topic. for the adhoc task documents are judged with respect to the topic as a whole. relevance levels are similar in structure to the levels used in commercial web search, including a spam/junk level. moreover, the top two levels of the assessment structure are closely related to the homepage finding and topic distillation tasks appearing in older web tracks. for the diversity task, documents are judged with respect to the subtopics, as well as with respect to the topic as a whole. for trec 2011, the topic selection process was modified slightly from previous years. for trec 2009 and 2010, topics were chosen to be of medium-to-high frequency. trec 2011 attempts to work with more obscure topics, which may still be underspecified (i.e., faceted) but may be less ambiguous. search engines have difficulty with queries of this type, since they can rely less on click/anchor information, and popularity signals like pagerank. with these new tough topics we hope to work in an area of web retrieval that has received relatively little attention. given the smaller number of pages that may be relevant for these tough topics, we may potentially be able to create a more reusable collection, with sufficiently complete judgments.
@method are severe musculoskeletal injuries associated with symptoms of common mental disorders among male european professional footballers? this article reports on the development of short forms from the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (promis™) sleep disturbance (sd) and sleep-related impairment (sri) item banks. results from post-hoc computerized adaptive testing (cat) simulations, item discrimination parameters, item means, and clinical judgments were used to select the best-performing 8 items for sd and sri. the final 8-item short forms provided less test information than the corresponding full banks, but correlated strongly with the longer forms. the short forms had greater measurement precision than the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) and the epworth sleepiness scale (ess), as indicated by larger test information values across the continuum of severity, despite having fewer total items—a major advantage for both research and clinical settings.
@background therapeutic targeting using tumor specific peptides inhibits long non-coding rna hotair activity in ovarian and breast cancer long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are key regulators of chromatin state, yet the nature and sites of rna-chromatin interaction are mostly unknown. here we introduce chromatin isolation by rna purification (chirp), where tiling oligonucleotides retrieve specific lncrnas with bound protein and dna sequences, which are enumerated by deep sequencing. chirp-seq of three lncrnas reveal that rna occupancy sites in the genome are focal, sequence-specific, and numerous. drosophila rox2 rna occupies male x-linked gene bodies with increasing tendency toward the 3' end, peaking at ces sites. human telomerase rna terc occupies telomeres and wnt pathway genes. hotair lncrna preferentially occupies a ga-rich dna motif to nucleate broad domains of polycomb occupancy and histone h3 lysine 27 trimethylation. hotair occupancy occurs independently of ezh2, suggesting the order of rna guidance of polycomb occupancy. chirp-seq is generally applicable to illuminate the intersection of rna and chromatin with newfound precision genome wide.
@background thrombospondin-1 interacts with trypanosoma cruzi surface calreticulin to enhance cellular infection calreticulin, a calcium-binding protein that is highly conserved in its multiple functions, is present in a wide spectrum of subcellular compartments in virtually every cell of higher organisms. in this article, we propose a dual role for parasite calreticulin, with emphasis on the trypanosoma cruzi model. by modulating the vertebrate complement system, calreticulin might provide the parasite with an effective immune-escape mechanism. alternatively, by inhibiting angiogenesis, the parasite molecule might protect the host from ongoing neoplasic aggressions. many questions are still unanswered, particularly those regarding the consequences that these interactions could have in vivo for both the parasite and the host.
@background topical chlorhexidine for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a meta-analysis* objective the purpose of this study was to describe the effect of an early post-intubation oral application of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral microbial flora and ventilator-associated pneumonia.   methods thirty-four intubated patients were randomly assigned to chlorhexidine gluconate by spray or swab or to control group. oral cultures were done at study admission, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, whereas the clinical pulmonary infection score (cpis) was documented at study admission, 48, and 72 hours.   results reductions in oral culture scores (less growth) were only found in the treatment groups (swab and spray); no reduction was found in the control group. there was a trend for fewer positive cultures in the combined treatment groups. the mean cpis for the control group increased to a level indicating pneumonia (4.7 to 6.6), whereas the cpis for the treatment group increased only slightly (5.17 to 5.57).   conclusions trends in the data suggest that use of chlorhexidine gluconate in the early post-intubation period may mitigate or delay the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
@result sharing costs for better selfish network design we investigate cost-sharing algorithms for multicast transmission. economic considerations point to two distinct mechanisms, marginal cost and shapley value, as the two solutions most appropriate in this context. we prove that the former has a natural algorithm that uses only two messages per link of the multicast tree, while we give evidence that the latter requires a quadratic total number of messages. we also show that the welfare value achieved by an optimal multicast tree is np-hard to approximate within any constant factor, even for bounded-degree networks. the lower-bound proof for the shapley value uses a novel algebraic technique for bounding from below the number of messages exchanged in a distributed computation; this technique may prove useful in other contexts as well.
@method molecular analysis of duck hepatitis virus type 1 reveals a novel lineage close to the genus parechovirus in the family picornaviridae. the abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely related software applications available on the world wide web (www) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. the objective of this web server is to provide easy access to rna and dna folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. by making use of universally available web guis (graphical user interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. a variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. the portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. this url will be referred to as 'mfoldroot'.
@result measuring symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome: development of a framework for clinical trials irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) involves a broad range of physiological and psychological alterations that may affect brain–gut dysregulation, gut function, visceral perception, and mucosal integrity and function. despite advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and transmitters in the brain–gut axis, a reliable biologic marker of ibs has yet to be identified (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). ibs diagnosis and status depend entirely on an assessment of ibs signs and symptoms. this has made development of optimal end points and study design for evaluation of efficacy of ibs drugs a challenge. this article addresses three main topics: the evolution of primary end points for ibs clinical trials; a potential path forward for ibs end points in new clinical trials; and recommendations for the future development of patient-reported outcome (pro) instruments for use in ibs clinical trials.
@method acneiform rash due to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors: high-level laser therapy as an innovative approach background the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (lllt) as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy of smoking and non-smoking patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis.   methods all 36 systemically healthy patients who were included in the study initially received non-surgical periodontal therapy. the lllt group (n = 18) received gaalas diode laser therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy. a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm was used for the lllt. energy density of 4 j/cm(2) was applied to the gingival surface after periodontal treatment on the first, second, and seventh days. each of the lllt and control groups was divided into two groups as smoking and non-smoking patients to investigate the effect of smoking on treatment. gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from all patients and clinical parameters were recorded on baseline, the first, third, and sixth months after treatment. matrix metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, transforming growth factor-β1, and basic-fibroblast growth factor levels in the collected gingival crevicular fluid were measured.   results the primary outcome variable in this study was change in gingival bleeding and inflammation. at all time points, the lllt group showed significantly more improvement in sulcus bleeding index (sbi), clinical attachment level, and probing depth (pd) levels compared to the control group (p <0.001). there were clinically significant improvements in the laser-applied smokers' pd and sbi levels compared to smokers to whom a laser was not applied, between the baseline and all time points (p <0.001) (sbi score: control group 1.12, lllt group 1.49; pd: control group 1.21 mm, lllt group 1.46 mm, between baseline and 6 months). transforming growth factor-β1 levels and the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-1 to tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 decreased significantly in both groups at 1, 3, and 6 months after periodontal therapy (p <0.001). basic-fibroblast growth factor levels significantly decreased in both groups in the first month after the treatment, then increased in the third and sixth months (p <0.005). no marker level change showed significant differences between the groups (p <0.05).   conclusion lllt as an adjunctive therapy to non-surgical periodontal treatment improves periodontal healing.
@background outcomes associated with early removal versus retention of peripherally inserted central catheters after diagnosis of catheter-associated infections in neonates objectives patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units (nicus) are at high risk of nosocomial infection. we conducted a national multicenter assessment of nosocomial infections in nicus to determine the prevalence of infections, describe associated risk factors, and help focus prevention efforts.   study design we conducted a point prevalence survey of nosocomial infections in 29 pediatric prevention network nicus. patients present on the survey date were included. data were collected on underlying diagnoses, therapeutic interventions/treatments, infections, and outcomes.   results of the 827 patients surveyed, 94 (11.4%) had 116 nicu-acquired infections: bloodstream (52.6%), lower respiratory tract (12.9%), ear-nose-throat (8.6%), or urinary tract infections (8.6%). infants with infections were of significantly lower birth weight (median 1006 g [range 441 to 4460 g] vs 1589 g [range 326 to 5480 g]; p <.001) and had longer median durations of stay than those without infections (88 days [range 8 to 279 days] vs 32 days [range 1 to 483 days]; p <.001). most common pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. patients with central intravascular catheters (relative risk = 3.81, ci 2.32-6.25; p <.001) or receiving total parenteral nutrition (relative risk = 5.72, ci 3.45-9.49; p <.001) were at greater risk of bloodstream infection.   conclusions this study documents the high prevalence of nosocomial infections in patients in nicus and the urgent need for more effective prevention interventions.
@background iron chelator inducesmip-3α/ccl20 in human intestinal epithelial cells: implication for triggering mucosal adaptive immunity dendritic cells (dcs) form a network comprising different populations that initiate and differentially regulate immune responses. langerhans cells (lcs) represent a unique population of dcs colonizing epithelium, and we present here observations suggesting that macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3α plays a central role in lc precursor recruitment into the epithelium during inflammation. (a) among dc populations, mip-3α was the most potent chemokine inducing the selective migration of in vitro–generated cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell–derived lc precursors and skin lcs in accordance with the restricted mip-3α receptor (cc chemokine receptor 6) expression to these cells. (b) mip-3α was mainly produced by epithelial cells, and the migration of lc precursors induced by the supernatant of activated skin keratinocytes was completely blocked with an antibody against mip-3α. (c) in vivo, mip-3α was selectively produced at sites of inflammation as illustrated in tonsils and lesional psoriatic skin where mip-3α upregulation appeared associated with an increase in lc turnover. (d) finally, the secretion of mip-3α was strongly upregulated by cells of epithelial origin after inflammatory stimuli (interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α) or t cell signals. results of this study suggest a major role of mip-3α in epithelial colonization by lcs under inflammatory conditions and immune disorders, and might open new ways to control epithelial immunity.
@background the monoaminergic modulation of sensory-mediated aversive responses in caenorhabditis elegans requires glutamatergic/peptidergic cotransmission neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
@method rac3 influences the chemoresistance of colon cancer cells through autophagy and apoptosis inhibition rac3 is an oncogene naturally overexpressed in several tumors. besides its role as coactivator, it can exert several protumoral cytoplasmic actions. autophagy was found to act either as a tumor suppressor during the early stages of tumor development, or as a protector of the tumor cell in later stages under hypoxic conditions. we found that rac3 overexpression inhibits autophagy when induced by starvation or rapamycin and involves rac3 nuclear translocation‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms. moreover, hypoxia inhibits the rac3 gene expression leading to the autophagy process, allowing tumor cells to survive until angiogenesis occurs. the interplay between rac3, hypoxia, and autophagy could be an important mechanism for tumor progression and a good target for a future anticancer therapy.
@method operator based multicomponent am-fm signal separation approach the operator-based signal separation approach uses an adaptive operator to separate a signal into additive subcomponents. the approach can be formulated as an optimization problem whose optimal solution can be derived analytically. however, the following issues must still be resolved: estimating the robustness of the operator's parameters and the lagrangian multipliers, and determining how much of the information in the null space of the operator should be retained in the residual signal. to address these problems, we propose a novel optimization formula for operator-based signal separation and show that the parameters of the problem can be estimated adaptively. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by processing several signals, including real-life signals.
@method the willingness of us pediatric dentists to use atraumatic restorative treatment (art) with their patients: a conjoint analysis. objectives service provision varies by dentist, practice and patient factors. however, limited subsets of these potential influences on service rates have been explored. more comprehensive models could improve our understanding of the factors influencing the pattern of care delivered. the aim of this study was to examine variation in dental services by dentist (treatment choice, practice beliefs, preferences for patients, demographics), practice (type, location, size and volume of practice) and patient (visit, demographic, oral health and socio-economic) characteristics.   methods a random sample of australian dentists was surveyed in 1997-98 (response rate=60.3%). private general practitioners (n=345) provided dentist and practice data, and service provision and patient variables were collected from a log of a typical clinical day (n=4,115 patients). multivariate negative binomial regression models were fitted for diagnostic, preventive, restorative, extraction and prosthodontic services.   results significant dentist factors included (p<0.05; rr=rate ratio): lower diagnostic rates (rr=0.78) for dentists with stronger practice beliefs for giving information about cost and treatment options; preventive rates were lower (rr=0.74) for male dentists and higher (rr=1.48) for younger dentists aged 20-29 years; restorative rates were higher (rr=1.27) for dentists that rated patient preferences more highly in treatment choice and in the dentist age group 30-39 years (rr=1.25); extraction rates were lower (rr=0.61) for dentists with stronger preferences for patients that would adhere with treatment but higher (rr=1.57) for dentists with stronger preferences for sociable patients; and prosthodontic rates were lower (rr=0.38) for dentists with stronger preferences for adaptable patients who were willing to cooperate when expected to do so. practice factors included: higher preventive (rr=1.28) and prosthodontic rates (rr=2.07) in solo practice; higher preventive (rr=1.34) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.42) in capital cities; lower diagnostic (rr=0.82) and extraction rates (rr=0.55) in practices with fewer other dentists; higher diagnostic (rr=1.33) and extraction (rr=1.62) rates but lower restorative rates (rr=0.84) in practices with lower patient visits per year. patient factors included: lower preventive (rr=0.76) but higher extraction rates (rr=1.45) for emergency visits; lower extraction rates (rr=0.60) for the insured; higher diagnostic rates (rr=1.17) for new patients; higher restorative (rr=1.31) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.46) for patients with decayed teeth; higher prosthodontic rates (rr=2.14) for those with dentures; and lower preventive (rr=0.66), but higher extraction (rr=2.22) and prosthodontic rates (rr=1.82) for patients from lower socio-economic status areas.   conclusions dental service rates were influenced by large number of small effects from a wide range of dentist, practice and patient factors. socio-economic and geographic barriers may need broad policy innovations to be addressed, but factors such as insurance and visit type have the potential to be altered to achieve better service outcomes and there is scope for research into clinical outcomes to improve the knowledge upon which treatment decisions are based.
@method verification of parameterized concurrent programs by modular reasoning about data and control we consider the verification of parameterized boolean programs— abstractions of shared-memory concurrent programs with an unbounded number of threads we propose that such programs can be model-checked by iteratively considering the program under k-round schedules, for increasing values of k, using a novel compositional construct called linear interfaces that summarize the effect of a block of threads in a k-round schedule we also develop a game-theoretic sound technique to show that k rounds of schedule suffice to explore the entire search-space, which allows us to prove a parameterized program entirely correct we implement a symbolic model-checker, and report on experiments verifying parameterized predicate abstractions of linux device drivers interacting with a kernel to show the efficacy of our technique.
@method using photomosaic and steganographic techniques for hiding information inside image mosaics the main aim of the paper is to analyze about security in image transfer through the network. secret- fragment-visible mosaic image is proposed for combining small tiles of secret image to form a target in the sense of mosaic. when this artwork is viewed at close, the observer can view smaller elements, yet when viewed at a distance the collection of tiles blend together to yield the overall picture. when the mosaic generating process starts, original image is divided into many tiles. before splitting the image, compare the image for mosaic creation. mosaic image is created automatically by composing small fragments of a given image in to target image, achieving an effect of embedding the given source image secretly in the resulting mosaic image. to create the mosaic image, first find the similar target image for selected source image. finding the best fit tile for embedding in the target image blocks. the information of placing the tile image fitting sequence in target image is embedding into random selected pixel in created mosaic image. the embedded information act as a text key file. the key file contains the tile image fitting sequence. without this key receiver can't retrieve the secret image.
@method expression of fura is modulated by ntca and strongly enhanced in heterocysts of anabaena sp. pcc 7120. the fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein is a global regulator in most prokaryotes that controls a large number of genes. fur is a classical repressor that uses ferrous iron as co-repressor and binds to specific dna sequences (iron boxes) as a dimer. three different genes coding for fur homologues have been identified in anabaena sp. pcc 7120. fura controls the transcription of flavodoxin, the product of the isib gene, and is moderately autoregulated. in this work, the promoter of the fura gene was defined and the fura protected regions in the fura and isib promoters were identified, showing that the binding sites for anabaena fura contain a/t-rich sequences with a variable arrangement compared to the conventional 19-base pair fur consensus. the influence of different factors on the interaction between fura and the promoters was evaluated in vitro. the affinity of fura for the dna targets was significantly affected by the redox status of this regulator and the presence of mn2+. the optimal binding conditions were observed in the presence of both mn2+ and dtt. those results suggest that, in addition to iron availability, fura–dna interaction is modulated by redox conditions.
@method expression profiling of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in norway spruce using est sequencing and real-time rt-pcr the gene ontology project (http://www.geneontology.org/) produces structured, controlled vocabularies and gene product annotations. gene products are classified according to the cellular locations and biological process in which they act, and the molecular functions that they carry out. we annotate gene products from a broad range of model species and provide support for those groups that wish to contribute annotation of further model species. the gene ontology facilitates the exchange of information between groups of scientists studying similar processes in different model organisms, and so provides a broad range of opportunities for plant scientists.
@result differential expression of foxo1 during development and myoblast differentiation of qinchuan cattle and its association analysis with growth traits forkhead box (fox) proteins play critical roles in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, immunity and aging of cells. most studies on fox proteins are limited to cultured cells and rodent. the aim of the current study is to detect by immunohistrochemistry whether foxo1, foxo3a and foxo4 proteins are localized in the stomach and intestine of the pig. the results showed that foxo4 exists in the mucosa in all parts of the stomach and intestine; foxo3a exists mainly in the lamina propria and muscularis of some parts. however, foxo1 is not detectable in all parts of the stomach and intestine. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that there exists a distinct expression pattern of fox proteins, and that foxo4 is a primary forkhead transcriptional factor localized in the gastrointestinal tracts of the pig.
@background systematic inequality and hierarchy in faculty hiring networks networks—an introduction.marke. j.newman. (2010,oxforduniversity press.) $65.38, £35.96 (hardcover), 772 pages. isbn-978-0-19-920665-0. network science or graph theory has its roots in the first half of the 18th century when leonhard euler, a prussian mathematician, analyzed the problem of finding a route through the city of königsberg that crossed every one of the cityʼs seven major bridges once and only once. ever since then, network theory has attracted the interest of mathematicians like the famous paul erdős, who (together with alfréd rényi [2] and independently gilbert [3]) was first to define random graphs in the late 1950s. later, social scientists joined in founding social network theory as a new branch of the field. in the last two decades, an explosion of research into network science has been stimulated by the recent introduction of the small-world [4] and scale-free [1] network paradigms. as a result, the field has become ever more multidisciplinary, and concepts from network theory have become standard knowledge in many areas of the natural and social sciences. examples of fields where network approaches have almost become standard tools are computer science, systems biology, engineering, and physics, just to name a few. at the same time, the knowledge about network theory has become somewhat fragmented: different terminology is used in different fields, and often solutions to problems that have been developed for one set of applications are not readily accessible to practitioners in other areas. with his new booknetworks—an introduction, mark newman aims at bridging this gap. using a consistent terminology, the book provides a summary of the knowledge about the empirical analysis and theory of networks that has been accumulated in this diverse set of disciplines over many years. the book is very successful in this pursuit and gives an excellent introduction to the topic of network theory. not only this, gradually working its way up from introductory content to more advanced topics, the book also provides a neat collection of relevant material for the more advanced reader. a set of problems at the end of most chapters allows the reader to check his or her understanding of the presented material. altogether, i highly recommend this book, not only for the non-specialist reader who wants to understand what network theory is all about, but also for the specialist who wants to use the book as a quick reference or as the basis for an undergraduate or more advanced course taught at a university. after so much praise, let us have a brief look at the content of the book. it basically consists of five parts. the first part highlights the interdisciplinary nature of network applications and discusses examples from four different areas of research: infrastructure networks, social networks, networks linked to the transmission of information, and biological networks. in each of these broad application areas the author explains the most prominent examples and illustrates the relevance of network approaches. the second part of the book is composed of an introduction to the fundamentals of network theory. chapter ii.6 sets out with a series of definitions of various types of networks, followed by the introduction of various metrics generally used to classify networks. chapter ii.8 discusses smallworldness, degree distributions, clustering, and assortative mixes of degrees, and finishes by giving a classification of networks in terms of their macroscopic appearance. having defined network metrics, the next logical step is to think about efficient computer algorithms to evaluate them for a given network. accordingly, the third part of the book gives a very useful summary of some frequently applied computer algorithms. again the chapter starts with a readily accessible introduction to some basics, such as various methods of storing a networks in computer memory. the author then quickly progresses to algorithms for the efficient computation of graph
@background locked nucleic acid gapmers and conjugates induce potent silencing of adam 33 , an asthma-associated metalloprotease with nuclear-localized mrna antisense oligonucleotides (asos) can suppress the expression of a target gene by cleaving pre-mrna and/or mature mrna via rnase h1. following the initial endonucleolytic cleavage by rnase h1, the target rnas are degraded by a mechanism that is poorly understood. to better understand this degradation pathway, we depleted the expression of two major 5' to 3' exoribonucleases (xrns), named xrn1 and xrn2, and analyzed the levels of 3' fragments of the target rnas in vitro. we found that the 3' fragments of target pre-mrna generated by aso were almost completely degraded from their 5' ends by nuclear xrn2 after rnase h1-mediated cleavage, whereas the 3' fragments of mature mrna were partially degraded by xrn2. in contrast to aso, small interference rna (sirna) could reduce the expression level of only mature mrna, and the 3' fragment was degraded by cytoplasmic xrn1. our findings indicate that the rnas targeted by rnase h1-dependent aso are rapidly degraded in the nucleus, contrary to the cytoplasmic degradation pathway mediated by sirna.

@background metabolite profiling of symbiont and host during thermal stress and bleaching in a model cnidarian–dinoflagellate symbiosis stable cnidarian-dinoflagellate (genus symbiodinium) endosymbioses depend on the regulation of nutrient transport between symbiodinium populations and their hosts. it has been previously shown that the host cytosol is a nitrogen-deficient environment for the intracellular symbiodinium and may act to limit growth rates of symbionts during the symbiotic association. this study aimed to investigate the cell proliferation, as well as ultrastructural and lipid compositional changes, in free-living symbiodinium spp. (clade b) upon nitrogen (n)-deprivation. the cell proliferation of the n-deprived cells decreased significantly. furthermore, staining with a fluorescent probe, boron dipyrromethane 493/503 (bodipy 493/503), indicated that lipid contents progressively accumulated in the n-deprived cells. lipid analyses further showed that both triacylglycerol (tag) and cholesterol ester (ce) were drastically enriched, with polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa; i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, heneicosapentaenoic acid, and oleic acid) became more abundant. ultrastructural examinations showed that the increase in concentration of these lipid species was due to the accumulation of lipid droplets (lds), a cellular feature that have previously shown to be pivotal in the maintenance of intact endosymbioses. integrity of these stable lds was maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance possibly provided by their surface proteins. proteomic analyses of these lds identified proteins putatively involved in lipid metabolism, signaling, stress response and energy metabolism. these results suggest that lds production may be an adaptive response that enables symbiodinium to maintain sufficient cellular energy stores for survival under the n-deprived conditions in the host cytoplasm.
@result mercury concentrations in the tissues of bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) and striped dolphins (stenella coeruloalba) stranded on the croatian adriatic coast tissue distributions of metals (mercury, lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, iron, manganese) were determined in six specimens of striped dolphins (stenella coeruleoalba, meyen) stranded on the apulian coasts (southern italy) between february and june 1987. methyl mercury and selenium were also determined in the liver samples. the liver accumulated the highest concentrations of metals, except for cadmium and chromium. metal levels were higher than those found in dolphins living in the atlantic, but lower than those recorded in the same species from the french mediterranean coasts. necroscopic surveys found that all specimens were affected by haemorrhagic gastritis, but the cause was not clear. while it was not possible to related the death of dolphins to a specific cause, or to contaminants, the accumulation of metals is likely to contribute to the health of the organism and represents a risk factor for dolphins.
@background optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
@background nodular regenerative hyperplasia secondary to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases background in advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, the addition of a neo-adjuvant systemic treatment to surgery might translate into a survival advantage, although this is yet to be confirmed by ongoing randomized trials. the objective of this study was to assess the effects of preoperative systemic chemotherapy on the morphology of non-tumoral liver.   patients and methods a large series of surgically resected liver metastases (n=153) was selected. light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against endothelial cells (cd31) and hepatic stellate cells (alpha-sm actin, crbp-1) were performed to identify sinusoidal wall integrity.   results we found that 44 (51%) of the 87 post-chemotherapic liver resection specimens had sinusoidal dilatation and hemorrhage, related to rupture of the sinusoidal barrier. in contrast, the 66 livers treated by surgery alone remained normal. in 21 out of the 44 post-chemotherapy patients (48%), perisinusoidal and veno-occlusive fibrosis also developed. sinusoidal injury persisted several months after end of chemotherapy, and fibrosis may progress. development of lesions was strongly correlated to the use of oxaliplatin; 34 out of 43 patients (78%) treated with this drug showed striking sinusoidal alterations.   conclusions systemic neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer frequently causes morphological lesions involving hepatic microvasculature. sinusoidal obstruction, complicated by perisinusoidal fibrosis and veno-occlusive lesion of the non-tumoral liver revealed by this study, should be included in the list of the adverse side-effects of colorectal systemic chemotherapy, in particular related to the use of oxaliplatin.
@background developmental differences in the shear stress-induced expression of endothelial no synthase: changing role of ap-1. the ultraviolet (uv) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by ap-1 and nf-kappa b. the effect on ap-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-jun nh2-terminal activation domain. here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of jnk1, a distant relative of the map kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at thr and tyr during the uv response. significantly, ha-ras partially activates jnk1 and potentiates the activation caused by uv. jnk1 binds to the c-jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on ser-63 and ser-73. thus, jnk1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and uv irradiation. these properties indicate that jnk1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.
@method talin autoinhibition is required for morphogenesis the mammalian focal adhesion kinase (fak) family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases has been implicated in controlling a multitude of cellular responses to the engagement of cell-surface integrins and g-protein-coupled receptors. the high level of sequence conservation between the mammalian proteins and the drosophila homologue of fak, fak56, suggested that it would have similar functions. however, we show here that drosophila fak56 is not essential for integrin functions in adhesion, migration or signaling in vivo. furthermore, animals lacking fak56 are viable and fertile, demonstrating that fak56 is not essential for other developmental or physiological functions. despite this, overexpressed fak56 is a potent inhibitor of integrins binding to the extracellular matrix, suggesting that fak56 may play a subtle role in the negative regulation of integrin adhesion.
@background dna recognition by the swai restriction endonuclease involves unusual distortion of an 8 base pair a:t-rich target transcription factors can be divided into classes on the basis of their mode of interaction with the target promoter sequence. different protein domains responsible for dna recognition have been identified. in this review we discuss the leucine zipper structure, which has been found in several nuclear factors, including the oncoproteins fos and jun. structural considerations are summarized to help understand how dimerization is mediated by the leucine zipper and how this is the prerequisite for optimal target dna recognition by the adjacent basic domains.
@method promoter protection by a transcription factor acting as a local topological homeostat the escherichia coli dna‐binding protein fis serves as a dna architectural factor in two unrelated enzymatic reactions, the site‐specific inversion of dna and transcriptional activation of stable rna promoters. in both these processes, fis facilitates the assembly and dynamic transitions of two structurally distinct nucleoprotein complexes. we have proposed previously that, in these systems, fis stabilizes writhed dna microloops by binding at multiple helically phased sites in dna. however, fis also binds and bends dna at many non‐specific sites and, at its maximum levels in the early exponential phase, fis could potentially occupy a considerable part of the e. coli chromosome. here, we show that fis affects growth phase‐specific alterations in the supercoiling level of dna. expression of fis accelerates the accumulation of moderately supercoiled plasmids in stationary phase, which are stabilized by fis after nutritional shift‐up. in accordance with such a function, fis modulates the relaxing and supercoiling activities of topoisomerases in vitro in a way that keeps dna in a moderately supercoiled state. our results suggest that the primary role of fis is to modulate chromosomal dynamics during bacterial growth.
@background makings of the best spermatozoa: molecular determinants of high fertility spermatozoa deliver more than the paternal genome into the oocyte; they also carry remnant messenger rna from spermatogenesis. the rna profiles of spermatozoa from high-fertility and a low-fertility holstein bulls were analysed using affymetrix bovine genechips. a total of 415 transcripts out of approximately 24,000 were differentially detected in spermatozoa collected from both bulls (fold change > or =2.0; p<0.01). these transcripts were associated with different cellular functions and biological processes. spermatozoa from high-fertility bulls contained higher concentrations of transcripts for membrane and extracellular space protein locations, while spermatozoa from the low-fertility bulls were deficient of transcripts for transcriptional and translational factors. quantitative real-time pcr was used on three low-fertility and four high-fertility bulls to validate the microarray data. two highly represented transcripts in the microarray analysis (protamine 1 and casein beta 2) were validated, as well as a third transcript (thrombospondin receptor cd36 molecule) that showed a lower concentration in low-fertility bulls. this study presents the global analysis of spermatozoa originating from bulls with opposite fertility. these results provide some specific transcripts in spermatozoa that could be associated with bull fertility.
@method regional gray matter density associated with cognitive reflectivity–impulsivity: evidence from voxel-based morphometry in this study, we describe a psychobiological model of the structure and development of personality that accounts for dimensions of both temperament and character. previous research has confirmed four dimensions of temperament: novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence, which are independently heritable, manifest early in life, and involve preconceptual biases in perceptual memory and habit formation. for the first time, we describe three dimensions of character that mature in adulthood and influence personal and social effectiveness by insight learning about self-concepts. self-concepts vary according to the extent to which a person identifies the self as (1) an autonomous individual, (2) an integral part of humanity, and (3) an integral part of the universe as a whole. each aspect of self-concept corresponds to one of three character dimensions called self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence, respectively. we also describe the conceptual background and development of a self-report measure of these dimensions, the temperament and character inventory. data on 300 individuals from the general population support the reliability and structure of these seven personality dimensions. we discuss the implications for studies of information processing, inheritance, development, diagnosis, and treatment.
@result matrix metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms in patients with coronary artery disease matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the pathology underlying the majority of coronary artery disease. we previously identified several polymorphisms in the gene encoding mmp-9. in this study we tested the hypothesis that variation in the matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene influences the development of atherosclerosis. three common polymorphisms, i.e. −1562c>t, r+279q and +6c>t, were analysed in 1510 white subjects undergoing coronary angiography. analyses of individual polymorphisms showed that the frequencies of the c/t and t/t genotypes of the −1562c>t polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with coronary stenosis than in those with a normal angiogram. logistic regression analyses indicated that individuals carrying the −1562t allele had an approx. 1.5-fold higher risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.039–2.144), which was equivalent to an over 30% reduction in risk of coronary stenosis in individuals not carrying this allele (or 0.670, 95% ci 0.467–0.963). the three polymorphisms studied were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. haplotype analyses showed that the c-g-c haplotype (−1562c, +279q and +6c) was associated with a protective effect against atherosclerosis. individuals carrying this haplotype were at reduced risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 0.695, 95% ci 0.530.92). furthermore, the c-g-c haplotype was associated with less severe coronary atherosclerosis, i.e. carriers of this haplotype were at a lower risk of having coronary stenosis in more than one coronary artery (or 0.796, 95% ci 0.640.99). these data, together with the previous finding that the −1562t allele has a higher transcriptional activity than the −1562c allele, support the notion that genetic variation with an effect on mmp-9 expression influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
@method organizational and informational system factors in post-merger technology integration abstract the process of integrating information systems (is) during corporate mergers can be critical to their success. factors that can support or impede the successful integration of is include organizational and is attributes, organizational merger management and is integration activities. this study develops a conceptual framework for measuring is integration success and identifies the factors influencing it. a field survey investigates the relationship between these factors and success. according to the results of our field survey of cios, prior merger experience, is participation in merger planning, the quality of merger planning, the criteria used for setting is integration priorities, and a high level of data sharing across applications appear to have a positive influence on the success of the is integration. when changes that directly affect personnel have a significant impact, that impact seems to be mostly negative. programming language incompatibilities also have a negative impact on is integration success.
@background mineralogy and crystallography of some itokawa particles returned by the hayabusa asteroidal sample return mission laboratory analysis of samples returned from an asteroid establishes a direct link between asteroids and meteorites and provides clues to the complex history of the asteroid and its surface. meteorite studies suggest that each solar system object has a unique oxygen isotopic composition. chondrites, the most primitive of meteorites, have been believed to be derived from asteroids, but oxygen isotopic compositions of asteroids themselves have not been established. we measured, using secondary ion mass spectrometry, oxygen isotopic compositions of rock particles from asteroid 25143 itokawa returned by the hayabusa spacecraft. compositions of the particles are depleted in 16o relative to terrestrial materials and indicate that itokawa, an s-type asteroid, is one of the sources of the ll or l group of equilibrated ordinary chondrites. this is a direct oxygen-isotope link between chondrites and their parent asteroid.
@background the role of fat emulsion therapy in a rodent model of propranolol toxicity: a preliminary study amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
@background mechanisms contributing to prefrontal cortex maturation during adolescence the adolescent susceptibility to the onset of psychiatric disorders is only beginning to be understood when factoring in the development of the prefrontal cortex (pfc). the functional maturation of the pfc is dependent upon proper integration of glutamatergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vhipp) and the basolateral amygdala (bla). here we assessed how transient nmdar blockade during adolescence alters the functional interaction of vhipp–bla inputs in regulating pfc plasticity. local field potential recordings were used to determine changes in long-term depression (ltd) and long-term potentiation (ltp) of pfc responses resulting from vhipp and bla high-frequency stimulation in adult rats that received repeated injections of saline or the nmdar antagonist mk-801 from postnatal day 35 (p35) to p40. we found that early adolescent mk-801 exposure elicited an age- and input-specific dysregulation of vhipp–pfc plasticity, characterized by a shift from ltd to ltp without altering the bla-induced ltp. data also showed that the vhipp normally resets the ltp state of bla transmission; however, this inhibitory regulation is absent following early adolescent mk-801 treatment. this deficit was reminiscent of pfc responses seen in drug-naive juveniles. notably, local prefrontal upregulation of gabaaα1 function completely restored vhipp functionality and its regulation of bla plasticity in mk-801-treated rats. thus, nmdar signaling is critical for the periadolescent acquisition of a gaba-dependent hippocampal control of pfc plasticity, which enables the inhibitory control of the prefrontal output by the vhipp. a dysregulation of this pathway can alter pfc processing of other converging afferents such as those from the bla.

@method concurrent and predictive validity of components of disordered thinking in schizophrenia. behavioral data on a large patient group were collected by investigators from nine countries in the international pilot study of schizophrenia, sponsored by the world health organization. the data on half the group were analyzed to derive a system of 12 signs and symptoms for the identification of schizophrenia, as this disorder is diagnosed in many centers throughout the world. the findings were replicated with the other half of the patient group. the criteria constitute an operational method for identifying patients who would be commonly considered schizophrenic in many centers.
@background meta-analysis comparing outcomes of fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing prostheses in total knee arthroplasty. this paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. these reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. we discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. this approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. the model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. we suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.
@method pattern association and consolidation emerges from connectivity properties between cortex and hippocampus we present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. the network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp); a ready-to-use matlab code is included. it exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. due to the interplay between the delays and stdp, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. to our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. we speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (tngs, neural darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as attention to memories.
@method obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for postoperative complications after revision joint arthroplasty. administrative databases are increasingly used for studying outcomes of medical care. valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. we adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on international classification of diseases (icd-9-cm) diagnosis and procedure codes. the association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). the index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. these associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. they also persisted after controlling for patient age. we conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.
@method simplified primer design for pcr-based gene targeting and microarray primer database: two web tools for fission yeast we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast (schizosaccharomyces pombe), which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote: 4,824. the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases (kb) and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 1.8-kb element. regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. some 43% of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and rna splicing. these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization.
@method crucial role of rho-nuclear factor-kappab axis in angiotensin ii-induced renal injury. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is now believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs). several g(i)- and g(q)-coupled receptors, including the ang ii type 1 (at(1)) receptor, activate rho and rho-associated kinase in swiss 3t3 cells and cardiac myocytes. however, little is known about the role of rho-kinase in ang ii-induced vascular hypertrophy in vsmcs. in the present study, we explored the role of rho and rho-kinase in ang ii-induced protein synthesis in vsmcs. in unstimulated cells, rhoa was observed predominantly in the cytosolic fraction, but it was translocated in part to the particulate fraction in response to ang ii (100 nmol/l). this effect was completely blocked by the at(1) receptor blocker candesartan but not by the ang ii type 2 (at(2)) receptor antagonist pd123319. botulinum c(3) exoenzyme, which inactivated rhoa, attenuated ang ii-induced [(3)h]leucine incorporation. the specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y-27632, dose-dependently abolished ang ii-induced protein synthesis and also suppressed ang ii-induced c-fos mrna expression. on the other hand, y-27632 had no effect on ang ii-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which are reported to be involved in ang ii-induced protein synthesis, nor had it any effect on the ang ii-induced phosphorylation of phas-i, a heat- and acid-stable eif-4e-binding protein. the phosphorylation of phas-i is regulating for translation initiation. these observations suggest that the rho, rho-kinase, and c-fos pathways may play a role in ang ii-induced hypertrophic changes of vsmcs through a novel pathway.
@result efficacy and interindividual variability in motor-cortex plasticity following anodal tdcs and paired-associative stimulation objective to induce prolonged motor cortical excitability reductions by transcranial direct current stimulation in the human.   methods cathodal direct current stimulation was applied transcranially to the hand area of the human primary motor cortex from 5 to 9 min in separate sessions in twelve healthy subjects. cortico-spinal excitability was tested by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation and h-reflexes were used to learn about the origin of the excitability changes. neurone specific enolase was measured before and after the stimulation to prove the safety of the stimulation protocol.   results five and 7 min direct current stimulation resulted in motor cortical excitability reductions, which lasted for minutes after the end of stimulation, 9 min stimulation induced after-effects for up to an hour after the end of stimulation, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation. muscle evoked potentials elicited by transcranial electric stimulation and h-reflexes did not change. neurone specific enolase concentrations remained stable throughout the experiments.   conclusions cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation is capable of inducing prolonged excitability reductions in the human motor cortex non-invasively. these changes are most probably localised intracortically.
@background an artificial life approach for semi-supervised learning semi-supervised clustering employs a small amount of labeled data to aid unsupervised learning. previous work in the area has utilized supervised data in one of two approaches: 1) constraint-based methods that guide the clustering algorithm towards a better grouping of the data, and 2) distance-function learning methods that adapt the underlying similarity metric used by the clustering algorithm. this paper provides new methods for the two approaches as well as presents a new semi-supervised clustering algorithm that integrates both of these techniques in a uniform, principled framework. experimental results demonstrate that the unified approach produces better clusters than both individual approaches as well as previously proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithms.
@result regulation of intracellular zn homeostasis in two intestinal epithelial cell models at various maturation time points the uptake, intracellular distribution and cytotoxicity of high doses of extracellular zinc was investigated in c6 rat glioma cells. net zinc uptake occurred only above certain thresholds in time and concentration, below them no alterations of the intracellular zinc level were observed. these results were obtained by measurements with the fluorescent dye zinquin and by atomic absorption spectrometry, yielding similar results with both methods. sequestration of zinc in intracellular vesicles was observed by fluorescence microscopy. a protective effect of vesicular sequestration is indicated, because increased levels of intracellular zinc located in vesicles did not necessarily lead to an increase in cytotoxicity. we were able to show that in c6 cells, in contrast to other cell lines, zinc that is released from proteins by the no donor snoc is also sequestered in vesicular structures. these zinc-carrying vesicles showed to be constitutive and are assumed to have a function in the maintainance of the cytosolic content of zn2+ ions.
@background characterization of the δ7 mutant of cupriavidus metallidurans with deletions of seven secondary metal uptake systems cupriavidus metallidurans ch34 possesses a multitude of metal efflux systems. here, the function of the novel pib4‐type atpase czcp is characterized, which belongs to the plasmid pmol30‐mediated cobalt‐zinc‐cadmium (czc) resistance system. contribution of czcp to transition metal resistance in c. metallidurans was compared with that of three pib2‐type atpases (cada, znta, prba) and to other efflux proteins by construction and characterization of multiple deletion mutants. these data also yielded additional evidence for an export of metal cations from the periplasm to the outside of the cell rather than from the cytoplasm to the outside. moreover, metal‐sensitive escherichia coli strains were functionally substituted in trans with czcp and the three pib2‐type atpases. metal transport kinetics performed with inside‐out vesicles identified the main substrates for these four exporters, the km values and apparent turn‐over numbers. in combination with the mutant data, transport kinetics indicated that czcp functions as ‘resistance enhancer’: this pib4‐type atpase exports transition metals zn2+, cd2+ and co2+ much more rapidly than the three pib2‐type proteins. however, a basic resistance level has to be provided by the pib2‐type efflux pumps because czcp may not be able to reach all different speciations of these metals in the cytoplasm.
@background structural basis for ampk activation: natural and synthetic ligands regulate kinase activity from opposite poles by different molecular mechanisms. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) plays a major role in regulating cellular energy balance by sensing and responding to increases in amp/adp concentration relative to atp. binding of amp causes allosteric activation of the enzyme and binding of either amp or adp promotes and maintains the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the activation loop of the kinase. ampk has attracted widespread interest as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and, more recently, cancer. a number of direct ampk activators have been reported as having beneficial effects in treating metabolic diseases, but there has been no structural basis for activator binding to ampk. here we present the crystal structure of human ampk in complex with a small molecule activator that binds at a site between the kinase domain and the carbohydrate-binding module, stabilising the interaction between these two components. the nature of the activator-binding pocket suggests the involvement of an additional, as yet unidentified, metabolite in the physiological regulation of ampk. importantly, the structure offers new opportunities for the design of small molecule activators of ampk for treatment of metabolic disorders.
@background relationship between perceived body weight and body mass index based on self- reported height and weight among university students: a cross-sectional study in seven european countries objectives: to assess eating habits and some food related behaviours, beliefs and knowledge in educated young french adults.design: a standardized questionnaire administered in university classes.setting: university or ‘grandes ecoles’ of paris and dijon.subjects: 660 male and female french students.interventions: international survey; questionnaire composed of three major sections: (1) health-related attitudes such as substances used, dieting, health practices; (2) beliefs concerning behaviour and health, including eating habits; (3) knowledge, namely relevance of factors to diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases.results: gender, self-perception of body size, bmi and attempts to lose weight affected a number of behaviours. average bmi corresponded to standard values. ’healthy’ behaviours were often reported such as: avoiding fat and cholesterol, efforts to eat fruit and fiber. the french students showed a low frequency of snacking and a high regularity in having breakfast, especially respondents with lower bmi (females ≤23 and males ≤24.5 kg/m2). beliefs about the importance of behaviours were closely associated with the performance of the behaviours. awareness of the role of eating factors in cardiovascular diseases was observed.conclusion: the meal and snack pattern in french students is very close to the traditional model. more food- and health-related behaviours and attitudes are reported by women than men. some of them could be due to a genuine motivation for prevention and health in females or else to a greater wish to be thin. ‘desire to lose weight’ is often reported although bmi values are normally low in this young population. beliefs in the importance of a behaviour for health are correlated with the reported performance of the behaviours.sponsorship: data entry was supported in part through the commission of the european communities, medical and health research programme, concerted action on breakdown in human adaptation: quantification of parameters.
@method from block-based ensembles to online learners in changing data streams : if-and how-to most machine learning algorithms assume stationary environments, require a large number of training examples in advance, and begin the learning from scratch. in contrast, humans learn in changing environments with sequential training examples and leverage prior knowledge in new situations. to deal with real-world problems in changing environments, the ability to make human-like quick responses must be developed in machines.    many researchers have presented learning systems that assume the presence of hidden context and concept drift. in particular, several systems have been proposed that use ensembles of classifiers on sequential chunks of training examples. these systems can respond to gradual changes in large-scale data streams but have problems responding to sudden changes and leveraging prior knowledge of recurring contexts. moreover, these are not pure online learning systems.    we propose an online learning system that uses an ensemble of classifiers suited to recent training examples. we use experiments to show that this system can leverage prior knowledge of recurring contexts and is robust against various noise levels and types of drift.
@background vestibular blueprint in early vertebrates the development and evolution of the inner ear sensory patches and their innervation is reviewed. recent molecular developmental data suggest that development of these sensory patches is a developmental recapitulation of the evolutionary history. these data suggest that the ear generates multiple, functionally diverse sensory epithelia by dividing a single sensory primordium. those epithelia will establish distinct identities through the overlapping expression of genes of which only a few are currently known. one of these distinctions is the unique pattern of hair cell polarity. a hypothesis is presented on how the hair cell polarity may relate to the progressive segregation of the six sensory epithelia. besides being markers for sensory epithelia development, neurotrophins are also expressed in delaminating cells that migrate toward the developing vestibular and cochlear ganglia. these delaminating cells originate from multiple sites at or near the developing sensory epithelia and some also express neuronal markers such as neurod. the differential origin of precursors raises the possibility that some sensory neurons acquire positional information before they delaminate the ear. such an identity of these delaminating sensory neurons may be used both to navigate their dendrites to the area they delaminated from, as well as to help them navigate to their central target. the navigational properties of sensory neurons as well as the acquisition of discrete sensory patch phenotypes implies a much more sophisticated subdivision of the developing otocyst than the few available gene expression studies suggest.
@background computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
@background characterization of ig gene somatic hypermutation in the absence of activation-induced cytidine deaminase1 the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center b cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. we herein report mutations in the human counterpart of aid in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-igm syndrome (higm2). three major abnormalities characterize aid deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. the phenotype observed in higm2 patients (and in aid-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for aid in several crucial steps of b cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.
@background possible involvement of cell surface receptors in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in c6 glioma cells. we previously showed that sphingosine 1‐phosphate (spp) acts as a second messenger for tumor necrosis factor α‐induced interleukin‐6 (il‐6) synthesis in osteoblast‐like mc3t3‐e1 cells. in the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of il‐6 synthesis induced by spp in mc3t3‐e1 cells. spp significantly induced p42/p44 mitogen‐activated protein (map) kinase activity. pd98059, an inhibitor of map kinase kinase, suppressed spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis as well as spp‐induced map kinase activation. the patterns of both inhibitions were similar. tmb‐8, an inhibitor of ca2+ mobilization from intracellular ca2+ stores, significantly suppressed the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis. these results strongly suggest that spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is mediated via p42/p44 map kinase activation in osteoblast‐like cells and that the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is dependent on intracellular ca2+ mobilization.
@background the ercc1/xpf endonuclease is required for completion of homologous recombination at dna replication forks stalled by inter-strand cross-links abstract interstrand cross-links (icls) make up a unique class of dna lesions in which both strands of the double helix are covalently joined, precluding strand opening during replication and transcription. the repair of dna icls has become a focus of study since icls are recognized as the main cytotoxic lesion inflicted by an array of alkylating compounds used in cancer treatment. as is the case for double-strand breaks, a damage-free homologous copy is essential for the removal of icls in an error-free manner. however, recombination-independent mechanisms may exist to remove icls in an error-prone fashion. we have developed an in vivo reactivation assay that can be used to examine the removal of site-specific mitomycin c-mediated icls in mammalian cells. we found that the removal of the icl from the reporter substrate could take place in the absence of undamaged homologous sequences in repair-proficient cells, suggesting a cross-link repair mechanism that is independent of homologous recombination. systematic analysis of nucleotide excision repair mutants demonstrated the involvement of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and a partial requirement for the lesion bypass dna polymerase η encoded by the human polh gene. from these observations, we propose the existence of a recombination-independent and mutagenic repair pathway for the removal of icls in mammalian cells.
@background motor inhibition and response expectancy: a laplacian erp study the nogo potentials (n2/p3) were studied in a precuing auditory reaction time task in human subjects who had to either perform a button-press response (press condition) or imagine they were performing it (imagine condition). in the full precue condition (the subjects knew in advance which response they had to perform/imagine), in 25% of the trials, a nogo signal instructed the subject not to perform or not to imagine the prepared action. clear n2/p3 components were obtained on nogo trials on the press trials, but also on the imagine ones: the n2 was of similar amplitude in both conditions, whereas the p3 was of smaller amplitude in the imagine condition. the presence of nogo potential in motor imagery is discussed in terms of the functional significance of the n2/p3 complex.
@background increasing flair signal intensity in the postoperative cavity predicts progression in gross-total resected high-grade gliomas objective to determine if hyperintense fluid in the postsurgical cavity on follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) sequences can predict progression in gliomas.   material and methods observational study of magnetic resonance imaging signal of fluid within the post-surgical cavity in patients with glioma (grade ii-iv), with surgery and follow-up between 2007 and 2012. qualitative comparison between the signal of fluid in the cavity and of the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was performed on flair sequences. fluid in the cavity was classified as isointense or hyperintense compared to csf. double-blind reading was performed. the signal intensity was correlated with tumour progression, assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria.   results a total of 107 patients were included, of whom 90 had high-grade gliomas. inter-rater agreement was excellent, and intra-rater complete (k=0.94 and 1, p<.001). hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity occurred more commonly (58.9% versus 29.4%, p=.025) and earlier (mean 4.5 versus 9.9 months, p<.001) in high-grade than in low-grade gliomas. hyperintense fluid was associated with progression in high-grade gliomas, with a sensitivity of 65.7% (95%ci, 54.3-75.6%) and a specificity of 70.6% (95%ci, 46.6-87%), and in low-grade gliomas with a sensitivity of 50% (95%ci, 18.7-81.2%), and a specificity of 81.8% (95%ci, 51.1-96%). the positive predictive value of this sign was 90.6% (95%ci, 79.3-96.3%) for high-grade gliomas, and was higher for grade iv (93.2%, 95%ci, 87.3-99.1%) and lower for grade iii (77.8%, 95%ci, 59.6-96%), and low-grade gliomas (60%, 95%ci, 22.9-88.4%). false-positives were identified in 7 patients, due to bleeding or infection. hyperintense fluid in high-grade gliomas preceded progression in 22 patients (30.1%), with a mean of 4.1 months (sd 2.1, 95% ci, 3.2-5), and associated with poorer progression-free survival (mean 6.8 versus 11.7 months, p=.004).   conclusions hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity on follow-up flair sequences occurs more frequently and earlier in high-grade gliomas, and is associated with poorer progression-free survival. hyperintense fluid is associated with disease progression, and can predict the progression of resected gliomas. false-positives due to bleeding and infection can be observed, and are easily recognizable.
@method image defocus and altered retinal gene expression in chick: clues to the pathogenesis of ametropia. (1) we studied the influence of photoperiod and unilateral lid suture on post-natal ocular growth in two types of white leghorn chicks previously reported to respond differently to visual deprivation, truslow and cornell k chicks. we analyzed the chicks after 2 weeks of rearing, a time period commonly used in neuropharmacological studies of eye growth but much shorter than in most prior studies of photoperiod effects on the chick eye. (2) altering the photoperiod length significantly influenced the refraction and growth of both open and sutured eyes even at this early time, with differences between the two types of chicks. (3) the most prominent effect on the open eyes was the development of hyperopia with rearing under constant light, a response especially prominent in the cornell k chicks. in the open eyes under this condition, the anterior chamber shallowed and the vitreous chamber elongated in the axial dimension only, reciprocal changes that resulted in no net alteration of axial length at 2 weeks. a high variability in refraction of open eyes reared with constant illumination suggests the need for a dark period in the regulation of eye growth. (4) compared to contralateral open eyes, the lid-sutured eyes of both types of chicks developed longer total axial lengths and enlarged vitreous chambers in both axial and equatorial dimensions under each photoperiod. the effects on anterior chamber depth and refraction were complex and differed between the two types of chicks. (5) the responses in open eyes support the notion that growth of the vitrious chamber of the chick eye is differentially regulated in the axial and equatorial dimensions, previously indicated by pharmacological studies. the responses in both open and sutured eyes indicate different control mechanisms for anterior chamber and vitreous cavity growth.
@background a novel heavy metal atpase peptide from prosopis juliflora is involved in metal uptake in yeast and tobacco athma1 is a member of the heavy metal-transporting atpase family. it exhibits amino acid sequence similarity to two other zn(ii) transporters, athma2 and athma4, and contains poly-his motifs that are commonly found in zn(ii)-binding proteins, but lacks some amino acids that are typical for this class of transporters. athma1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. in comparison with wild-type plants, we observed a more pronounced sensitivity in the presence of high zn(ii) concentrations, and increased accumulation of zn in the chloroplast of t-dna insertional mutants in athma1. the zn(ii)-sensitive phenotype of athma1 knock-out plants was complemented by the expression of athma1 under the control of its own promoter. the zn(ii)-transporting activity of athma1 was confirmed in a heterologous expression system, saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sensitivity of yeast to high concentrations of zn(ii) was altered by the expression of athma1 lacking its n-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal. taken together, these results suggest that under conditions of excess zn(ii), athma1 contributes to zn(ii) detoxification by reducing the zn content of arabidopsis thaliana plastids.
@background the heterozygous abp1/abp1 insertional mutant has defects in functions requiring polar auxin transport and in regulation of early auxin-regulated genes. summarywhen low concentrations (e.g. 10-6 m) of labelled 3-indoleacetic acid (14c-iaa) or α-naphthaleneacetic acid (14c-naa) are added in vitro to homogenates of corn coleoptiles, radioactivity is reversibly bound to pelletable particles. from the saturation kinetics of the binding it is possible to estimate an apparent km between 10-6 m and 10-5 m and a concentration of specific sites of 10-7–10-6 m per tissue volume.the binding is auxin-specific. among many compounds tested, only auxins and such auxin analogues that are known to interact directly with auxin in transport and/or growth were found to interfere with this binding. for instance, the growth-active d-dichlorophenoxyisopropionic acid at 10-4 m inhibits 14c-naa binding more than the less active l-isomer.the auxin-binding fractions are practically free of dna and cytochrome-c oxidase and contain binding sites for 1-naphthylphthalamic acid. the results are discussed in context with the hyothesis—derived mainly from physiological data—that auxin receptors are localized at the plasma membrane.
@method which way and how far? tracking of translation and rotation information for human path integration cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. however, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. this poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. in such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. from a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p<.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. we illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fmri dataset from our laboratory (n=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fmri findings. to avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p<.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. we also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.
@method forest loss and matrix composition are the major drivers shaping dung beetle assemblages in a fragmented rainforest contrary to common belief, decomposition of diversity into independent richness and evenness components is mathematically impossible. however, richness can be decomposed into independent diversity and evenness or inequality components. the evenness or inequality component derived in this way is connected to most of the common measures of evenness and inequality in ecology and economics. this perspective justifies the derivation of measures of relative evenness, which give the amount of evenness relative to the maximum and minimum possible for a given richness. pielou’s [1] evenness measure j is shown to be such a measure.
@method the impact of women’s education, workforce experience, and the one child policy on fertility in china: a census study in guangdong, china this paper presents a data set that improves the measurement of educational attainment for a broad group of countries. we extend our previous estimates of educational attainment for the population over age 15 and over age 25 up to 1995 and provide projections for 2000. we discuss the estimation method for the measures of educational attainment and relate our estimates to alternative international measures of human capital stocks.
@background cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin e complex is involved in p120 catenin (p120ctn)-dependent cell growth control: a new role for p120ctn in cancer. the abnormally high number of centrosomes found in many human tumor cells can lead directly to aneuploidy and genomic instability through the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. to facilitate investigation of the mechanisms that control centrosome reproduction, a frog egg extract arrested in s phase of the cell cycle that supported repeated assembly of daughter centrosomes was developed. multiple rounds of centrosome reproduction were blocked by selective inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2-cyclin e (cdk2-e) and were restored by addition of purified cdk2-e. confocal immunomicroscopy revealed that cyclin e was localized at the centrosome. these results demonstrate that cdk2-e activity is required for centrosome duplication during s phase and suggest a mechanism that could coordinate centrosome reproduction with cycles of dna synthesis and mitosis.
@background markov logic for machine reading this note describes a scoring scheme for the coreference task in muc6. it improves on the original approach by: (1) grounding the scoring scheme in terms of a model; (2) producing more intuitive recall and precision scores; and (3) not requiring explicit computation of the transitive closure of coreference. the principal conceptual difference is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following coreference links to an approach defined by the model theory of those links.
@method is gaze following purely reflexive or goal-directed instead? revisiting the automaticity of orienting attention by gaze cues in this study we investigated the tendency of humans to imitate the gaze direction of other individuals. distracting gaze stimuli or non biological directional cues (arrows) were presented to observers performing an instructed saccadic eye movement task. eye movement recordings showed that observers performed less accurately when the distracting gaze and the instructed saccade had opposite directions, with a substantial number of saccades matching the direction of the distracting gaze. static (experiment 1) and dynamic (experiment 2) gaze distracters, but not pointing arrows (experiment 3), produced the effect. results show a strong predisposition of humans to imitate somebody else's oculomotor behaviour, even when detrimental to task performance. this is likely linked to a strong tendency to share attentional states of other individuals, known as joint attention.
@background different transcriptional control of metabolism and extracellular matrix in visceral and subcutaneous fat of obese and rimonabant treated mice aim/hypothesisthe distinct metabolic properties of visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes may be due to inherent characteristics of the cells that are resident in each fat depot. to test this hypothesis, human adipocytes were differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells obtained from visceral and subcutaneous fat depots and analysed for genetic, biochemical and metabolic endpoints.methodsstromal cells were isolated from adipose tissue depots of nondiabetic individuals. mrna levels of adipocyte-specific proteins were determined by real-time rt-pcr. insulin signalling was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. glucose transport was measured by a 2-deoxy-glucose uptake assay. adiponectin secretion in the adipocyte-conditioned medium was determined by a specific ria.resultswith cell differentiation, mrna levels of pparg, c/ebpα (also known as cebpa), ap2 (also known as gtf3a), glut4 (also known as slc2a4) were markedly upregulated, whereas glut1 (also known as slc2a1) mrna did not change. however, expression of c/ebpα, ap2 and adiponectin was higher in subcutaneous than in visceral adipocytes. by contrast, adiponectin was secreted at threefold higher rates by visceral than by subcutaneous adipocytes while visceral adipocytes also showed two- to threefold higher insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, irs proteins, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 was more rapid and tended to decrease at earlier time-points in visceral than in subcutaneous adipocytes.conclusions/interpretationsubcutaneous and visceral adipocytes, also when differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells, retain differences in gene expression, adiponectin secretion, and insulin action and signalling. thus, the precursor cells that reside in the visceral and subcutaneous fat depots may already possess inherent and specific metabolic characteristics that will be expressed upon completion of the differentiation programme.
@background first-order complete and computationally complete query languages for spatio-temporal databases in this paper, we study the expressive power and the complexity of first-order logic with arithmetic, as a query language over relational and constraint databases. we consider constraints over various domains (n, z, q, and r), and with various arithmetical operations (⩽, +, ×, etc.).    we first consider the data complexity of first-order queries. we prove in particular that linear queries can be evaluated in ac0 over finite integer databases, and in nc1 over linear constraint databases. this improves previously known bounds. we also show that over all domains, enough arithmetic lead to arithmetical queries, therefore, showing the frontiers of constraints for database purposes.    we then tackle the problem of the expressive power, with the definability of the parity and the connectivity, which are the most classical examples of queries not expressible in first-order logic over finite structures. we prove that these two queries are first-order definable in the presence of (enough) arithmetic. nevertheless, we show that they are not definable with constraints of interest for constraint databases such as linear constraints for instance. finally, we developed reduction techniques for queries over constraint databases, that allow us to draw conclusions with respect to their undefinability in various constraint query languages.
@result methionine flux to transsulfuration is enhanced in the long living ames dwarf mouse factors affecting longevity are complex and poorly understood. we have recently found that ames dwarf mice (df/df), which are deficient in growth hormone (gh), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, live significantly longer than their normal siblings whereas transgenic mice that overexpress gh exhibit reduced life-spans and various indices of premature aging. the production of reactive oxygen species increases with aging and is associated with dna damage to the tissues. however, several cellular oxygen scavenging/detoxifying systems exist that improve the antioxidative defense capacity of cells. we evaluated the activity of enzymes involved in this defense system in liver, kidney, and heart tissue from dwarf, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bovine gh transgenic, and corresponding groups of normal mice. liver glutathione and ascorbate levels were lower (p<0.0025) in dwarf animals compared to normal and gh transgenic mice. by contrast, the level of catalase activity, which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, in dwarf liver and kidney was significantly higher when compared to the other groups. animals deficient in gh (dwarf) live longer and exhibit enzyme activities and levels that may combat oxidative stress more efficiently than normal mice and those overexpressing gh.
@background activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by carcinogenic aromatic amines and modulatory effects of their n-acetylated metabolites arylamines and heterocyclic arylamines (haas) are of particular interest because of demonstrated carcinogenicity in animals and humans and the broad exposure to many of these compounds. the activation of these, and also some arylamine drugs, involves n-hydroxylation, usually by cytochrome p450 (p450). p450 1a2 plays a prominent role in these reactions. however, p450 1a1 and 1b1 and other p450s are also important in humans as well as experimental animals. some arylamines (including drugs) are n-hydroxylated predominantly by p450s other than those in family 1. other oxygenases can also have roles. an important issue is extrapolation between species in predicting cancer risks, as shown by the low rates of haa activation by rat p450 1a2 and low levels of p450 1a2 expression in some nonhuman primates.
@result major metacestodes in cattle slaughtered at wolaita soddo municipal abattoir, southern ethiopia: prevalence, cyst viability, organ distribution and socioeconomic implications objective the study was conducted between october 2005 and april 2006 in awassa town and its surroundings to investigate the status of t. saginata taeniasis, its socio-economic importance and potential risk factors.   methods questionnaire survey was conducted on 120 volunteer individuals selected at random. additionally, retrospective study on taenicidal drugs inventories at 12 pharmaceutical shops was conducted.   results t. saginata taeniasis was a wide spread problem in the town and its surroundings with overall prevalence of 64.2% (77 out of 120) and maximum infection frequencies of five times per year. the prevalence of taeniasis was significantly varied between religion, occupation, raw meat consumption and use of spices with raw meat. accordingly, christian communities (or = 5.2, 95% ci = 1.20-22.50), high-risk groups (or = 4.05, 95% ci = 1.27-12.93), raw meat consumers (or = 7.9, 95% ci = 2.46-5.66), and spices users (or = 11.6, 95% ci = 2.85-47.28) had higher likelihood of acquiring taeniasis than muslim communities, low risk groups, cooked meat eaters and non-spices users, respectively. conversely, prevalence was not varied between sex, age, marital status and educational backgrounds of the respondents. respondents' preferences to available taenicidal drugs had strong linear relationship with drug dose sold (r2 = 0.92), and showed that niclosamide (46.8%) was the drug of first choice while praziquantel (13%) was the least preferred drug. the taenicidal drug doses and treatment cost from 2002 to 2005 were estimated to be 4,913,346 adult doses and 820,343 usd (7,219,021 eth. birr as per rate of 2006).   conclusion taeniasis was a wide spread problem with higher prevalence and frequent infections in the town and its surroundings. sociocultural conditions and occupation were the major risk factors for the occurrence of the disease. hence, owing to its public health and economic importance, taeniasis deserves serious attention in order to safeguard the public health.
@background the molecular characterization of porcine egg precursor cells. abstract tor is a serine-threonine kinase that was originally identified as a target of rapamycin in saccharomyces cerevisiae and then found to be highly conserved among eukaryotes. in drosophila melanogaster, inactivation of tor or its substrate, s6 kinase, results in reduced cell size and embryonic lethality, indicating a critical role for the tor pathway in cell growth control. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian tor (mtor) remain unclear. in this study, we disrupted the kinase domain of mouse mtor by homologous recombination. while heterozygous mutant mice were normal and fertile, homozygous mutant embryos died shortly after implantation due to impaired cell proliferation in both embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. homozygous blastocysts looked normal, but their inner cell mass and trophoblast failed to proliferate in vitro. deletion of the c-terminal six amino acids of mtor, which are essential for kinase activity, resulted in reduced cell size and proliferation arrest in embryonic stem cells. these data show that mtor controls both cell size and proliferation in early mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells.
@background functional outcomes after arthroscopic treatment of lateral epicondylitis background there are several alternative indicators of income information, which is a fundamental measure of individual socioeconomic position. in this study, we compared the degrees of associations of four types of income information with health variables among japanese adults. methods using a nationally representative sample of 29,446 men and 32,917 women aged 20 years and over, the associations between four income indicators and health variables were examined using the odds ratio in logistic regression analysis and the concentration index by sex and age group (20-59 years and 60+ years). income indicators consisted of total household income, equivalent household income, total household expenditure, and equivalent household expenditure. current smoking and self-rated health statuses were used as health variables. results a low income was associated with a high prevalence of smoking and fair/poor self-rated health, with some differences among sex and age groups and income indicators, but less difference among methods of statistical analyses. total and equivalent incomes were similarly and more markedly associated with smoking and self-rated health statuses, whereas equivalent expenditure showed the smallest degree of health difference. for the population aged 60+ years, the degree of health differences in smoking was similar between income and expenditure. conclusions although the degree of income-related health differences is dependent on health outcome and both sex and age group, this study suggests that either crude or equivalent household income is a useful indicator for health inequality among japanese adults.
@method evaluating the psychometric properties of the attitudes towards depression and its treatments scale in an australian sample objective to develop and psychometrically assess an instrument to measure patients' attitudes towards depression, to its treatments, and aspects of professional help in patients suffering from depression.   method a 27 item likert type instrument was developed and written based on an evidence from a literature review and in consultation with experts in depression. psychiatrists (n=12) participated in a validation process of the instrument before it was administered to outpatients (n=63) suffering from non-psychotic depression.   results internal consistency reliability for the instrument was 0.79 (cronbach's alpha) and there was 88% overall agreement between experts about the relevance of the instruments' items to test patients' attitudes to depression and its treatments, providing evidence for content validity. factor analysis resulted in five cohesive and theoretically meaningful factors: 1) acceptance of treatment, 2) perceived stigma and shame, 3) negative attitude towards antidepressants, 4) self stigma, and 5) preference for psychotherapy.   conclusion the developed instrument is a reliable, valid and empirical measure to assess attitudes towards depression and its treatments. future research should be designed to replicate and extend the present findings with larger and more heterogeneous samples.

@method g2 phase arrest prevents bristle progenitor self-renewal and synchronizes cell division with cell fate differentiation the drosophila bristle lineage is an excellent system in which to study how cell cycle and fate determination are synchronized in invariant cell lineages. in this model, five different cells arise from a single precursor cell, pi, after four asymmetric cell divisions. cell diversity is achieved by the asymmetric segregation of cell determinants, such as numb and neuralized (neur), resulting in differential activation of the notch (n) pathway. we show that down-regulation of cdc2, by over-expressing tribbles, dwee1, and dmyt1 (three negative regulators of cdc2) or by using thermo-sensitive cdc2 mutant flies, delayed pi mitosis, and altered the polarity and the number of subsequent cell divisions. these modifications were associated with a mother-daughter cell fate transformation as the pi cell acquired the identity of the secondary precursor cell, piib. this type of change in cell identity only occurred when the n signaling pathway was inactive since ectopic n signaling transformed pi to piia-progeny fate. these transformations in cell identity suggest that, although synchronized, cell cycle and fate determination are independent phenomena in the bristle lineage.
@background impairment of age estimation from faces in alzheimer's disease. an own-age bias in age estimation of faces. evelyne moyse university of li`ege serge br´ edart university of li`ege abstract: the occurrence of an own-age bias on age estimation of faces was assessed by comparing children (10-14), young (20-30) and older (65-75) adults’ performances. participants from each age group estimated both in-group and out-group faces. overall, the age of children’s faces was more accurately estimated than the age of both young and older adult faces. moreover, the age of young adult faces was more accurately estimated than that of older adults. a significant ”age of participants” x ”age of face stimuli” interaction was revealed. although we did not observe a crossed interaction where each age group would have been more accurate for in-group estimation than for out-group estimation, present results reveal the occurrence of an own-age bias in age estimation. there was no significant difference between the three groups when estimating child faces, but young and older adults were more accurate for in-group estimation than the other groups of participants.
@result retrieval of images using mean-shift and gaussian mixtures based on weighted color histograms this paper presents a novel bag of features (bof) method for image classification. the bof approach describes an image as a set of local descriptors using a histogram, where each bin represents the importance of a visual word. this indexing approach has been frequently used for image classification, and we have seen several implementations, but crucial representation choices — such as the weighting schemes — have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. in our work, we propose a fuzzy model as an alternative to known weighting schemes in order to create more representative image signatures. furthermore, we use the fuzzy signatures to train the gaussian naïve bayesian network and classify images. experiments with corel-1000 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the known implementations.
@method oscillatory potentials and the b-wave: partial masking and interdependence in dark adaptation and diabetes in the rat to evaluate the effect of a long period of dark adaptation on the light-adapted electroretinogram (erg), photopic ergs were recorded before (light-adapted) and immediately after (light-readapted) 15 minutes of dark adaptation. the amplitude of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was 48% +/- 4% of that in the light-adapted erg, and the peak time of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was delayed by an average of 3.49 +/- 1.09 ms. segmental analysis of the b-wave showed that the last segment of the ascending limb of the b-wave (from the second oscillatory potential [op] to the peak) was attenuated the most (61% +/- 8%). in fact, the reduction in the amplitude of the last segment alone accounted for more than 60% +/- 13% of the overall reduction observed for the entire b-wave. this last segment appears to correspond to op4 in the 100- to 1000-hz recordings. the amplitude of op4 in the light-readapted erg was 56.5% +/- 10% of that in the light-adapted erg, a similar reduction to that observed for the last segment of the 1- to 1000-hz b-wave. the results strongly support the concept that the b-wave of the photopic erg may actually represent a composite of potentials whose individual contributions are best visualized when the erg is recorded with the 100- to 1000-hz bandwidth.
@background ptdins4p synthesis by pi4kiiiα at the plasma membrane and its impact on plasma membrane identity abstract the stt4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has been shown to generate a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p) at the plasma membrane, critical for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell viability. to further understand the essential role of stt4-mediated pi4p production, we performed a genetic screen using the stt4ts mutation to identify candidate regulators and effectors of pi4p. from this analysis, we identified several genes that have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism. in particular, we observed synthetic lethality when both sphingolipid and pi4p synthesis were modestly diminished. consistent with these data, we show that the previously characterized phosphoinositide effectors, slm1 and slm2, which regulate actin organization, are also necessary for normal sphingolipid metabolism, at least in part through regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which binds directly to both proteins. additionally, we identify isc1, an inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase c, as an additional target of slm1 and slm2 negative regulation. together, our data suggest that slm1 and slm2 define a molecular link between phosphoinositide and sphingolipid signaling and thereby regulate actin cytoskeleton organization.
@background minipig model of maxillary distraction osteogenesis: immunohistochemical and histomorphometric analysis of the sequence of osteogenesis. the theoretic advantage of distraction osteogenesis of the craniofacial skeleton, especially in cases of severe midface retrusion and in the presence of maxillary scarring, is prevention of relapse following significant advancements. the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a new low-profile, intraoral, internal device for midface distraction at the conventional or high le fort i level. in addition, the present study compares the efficacy of immediate versus delayed distraction on subsequent maxillary relapse. four adult rhesus macaca mulatta monkeys were divided into two groups. group 1 underwent immediate midface distraction; group 2 underwent delayed distraction. all four monkeys underwent a modified le fort i osteotomy through an upper buccal sulcus incision and bilateral application of the intraoral midface distraction devices. no other osteotomies or incisions were necessary. immediate distraction, performed in group 1, entailed intraoperative activation of the devices and distraction of 10 mm followed by a 5-day lag period before postoperative activation and distraction of an additional 10 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. delayed distraction, performed in group 2, entailed a 5-day postoperative lag period before device activation and distraction of 20 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. both groups thus underwent 20 mm of midface distraction. all devices were removed 6 weeks after completion of distraction. all monkeys tolerated the devices and daily distraction uneventfully. on the basis of serial cephalograms and dental models obtained throughout the experimental period, there was no evidence of relapse in either the immediate or delayed groups 6 months after distraction. in addition, on the basis of histologic, ultrastructural, and dry skull analysis, no significant differences were observed in the quality of regenerate bone obtained when comparing the immediate and delayed distraction groups. significant midface advancement is thus feasible using this new internal, intraoral distraction device, which presents several advantages over other internal devices that require coronal incisions and additional osteotomies to achieve midface advancement. in addition, immediate distraction may abbreviate the distraction period without adverse sequelae.
@method review of a causal role of fructose-containing sugars in myocardial susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury. rodents are widely used to mimic human diseases to improve understanding of the causes and progression of disease symptoms and to test potential therapeutic interventions. chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension, together known as the metabolic syndrome, are causing increasing morbidity and mortality. to control these diseases, research in rodent models that closely mimic the changes in humans is essential. this review will examine the adequacy of the many rodent models of metabolic syndrome to mimic the causes and progression of the disease in humans. the primary criterion will be whether a rodent model initiates all of the signs, especially obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dysfunction of the heart, blood vessels, liver and kidney, primarily by diet since these are the diet-induced signs in humans with metabolic syndrome. we conclude that the model that comes closest to fulfilling this criterion is the high carbohydrate, high fat-fed male rodent.
@background van der woude syndrome in twins by three pedigree and statistical criteria van der woude syndrome (vws) appears to have been underreported and frequently not diagnosed. eight percent of gene carriers are not diagnosed because they are nonpenetrant. but among penetrant gene carriers as many as 80% may not have been recognized in the past. a direct estimate of incidence of vws is 3.6/100,000 births; indirect estimates are more than double that. the relative risk of inheriting a cleft from an affected parent is 22.43%; the risk of inheriting lip pits only, or being nonpenetrant is 27.57%. (this corrects a similar statement in the abstract of burdick et al [j craniofacial genet dev biol 5:181-208, 1985], which was incorrectly calculated). the idea of unitary control of the action of the vws gene in the three target tissues appears not to be supported. rather, we tend to support the idea that the gene is controlled independently in the three tissues. indications of a family at risk are listed and discussed.
@result the validity and reliability of an arabic version of the stop-bang questionnaire for identifying obstructive sleep apnea this study compared the predictive abilities of the stop-bang and epworth sleepiness scale (ess) for screening sleep clinic patients for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and sleep-disordered breathing (sdb). forty-seven new adult patients without previous diagnoses of osa or sdb were administered the stop-bang and ess and were assigned to osa or sdb risk groups based on their scores. stop-bang responses were scored with two body mass index cut points of 35 and 30 kg/m(2) (sb35 and sb30). the tools' predictive abilities were determined by comparing patients' predicted osa and sdb risks to their polysomnographic results. the sb30 correctly identified more patients with osa and sdb than the ess alone. the ess had the highest specificity for osa and sdb.
@background profile of atherosclerotic risk factors and management in patients of peripheral arterial disease at a tertiary care teaching hospital of north india background previous investigators have observed a doubling of the mortality rate among patients with intermittent claudication, and we have reported a fourfold increase in the overall mortality rate among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease, as diagnosed by noninvasive testing. in this study, we investigated the association of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease with rates of mortality from all cardiovascular diseases and from coronary heart disease.   methods we examined 565 men and women (average age, 66 years) for the presence of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease by means of two noninvasive techniques--measurement of segmental blood pressure and determination of flow velocity by doppler ultrasound. we identified 67 subjects with the disease (11.9 percent), whom we followed prospectively for 10 years.   results twenty-one of the 34 men (61.8 percent) and 11 of the 33 women (33.3 percent) with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease died during follow-up, as compared with 31 of the 183 men (16.9 percent) and 26 of the 225 women (11.6 percent) without evidence of peripheral arterial disease. after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the relative risk of dying among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease as compared with those with no evidence of such disease was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 4.9) for deaths from all causes, 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 11.4) for all deaths from cardiovascular disease, and 6.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.9) for deaths from coronary heart disease. the relative risk of death from causes other than cardiovascular disease was not significantly increased among the subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease. after the exclusion of subjects who had a history of cardiovascular disease at base line, the relative risks among those with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease remained significantly elevated. additional analyses revealed a 15-fold increase in rates of mortality due to cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease that was both severe and symptomatic.   conclusions patients with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease have a high risk of death from cardiovascular causes.
@method input stage-1 : regression stage-2 : contextual copy-pasting qi pi [ ] ... pixel representation we introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along with appearance cues, to retrieve 3d models for objects depicted in 2d still images from a large cad object library. critical to the success of our approach is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted scene. we introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained oxford vgg convolutional neural network (cnn) for surface normal prediction. our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the nyuv2 rgb-d dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods. furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for cad model retrieval. when using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from rgb-d images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using rgb-d input. finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve cad models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.
@method high-for-low and low-for-high: efficient boundary detection from deep object features and its applications to high-level vision this paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest-neighbor approach. the method is based on training a separate linear svm classifier for every exemplar in the training set. each of these exemplar-svms is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. while each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such exemplar-svms offers surprisingly good generalization. our performance on the pascal voc detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. but the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3d model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.
@method prediction of outcome in the vegetative state by machine learning algorithms: a model for clinicians? we introduce a new accuracy index for receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves, namely the partial area under the binormal roc graph over any specified region of interest. we propose a simple but general procedure, based on a conventional analysis of variance, for comparing accuracy indices derived from two or more different modalities. the proposed method is related to and compared with existing methodology, and is illustrated by results from an experiment on optimization of density and contrast yielded by multiform photographic images used for scintigraphy.
@background ipsilateral cortical activation in fibromyalgia patients during brushing correlates with symptom severity objective: to investigate cerebral activations underlying touch-evoked pain (dynamic–mechanical allodynia) in patients with neuropathic pain. methods: fmri was used in 12 patients with complex regional pain syndromes (crpss). allodynia was elicited by gently brushing the affected crps hand. elicited pain ratings were recorded online to obtain pain-weighted predictors. both activations and deactivations of blood oxygenation level–dependent signals were investigated. results: nonpainful stimulation on the nonaffected hand activated contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (s1), bilateral insula, and secondary somatosensory cortices (s2). in contrast, allodynia led to widespread cerebral activations, including contralateral s1 and motor cortex (m1), parietal association cortices (pa), bilateral s2, insula, frontal cortices, and both anterior and posterior parts of the cingulate cortex (aacc and pacc). deactivations were detected in the visual, vestibular, and temporal cortices. when rating-weighted predictors were implemented, only few activations remained (s1/pa cortex, bilateral s2/insular cortices, pacc). conclusions: allodynic stimulation recruits a complex cortical network. activations include not only nociceptive but also motor and cognitive processing. using a covariance approach (i.e., implementation of rating-weighted predictors) facilitates the detection of a neuronal matrix involved in the encoding of allodynia. the pattern of cortical deactivation during allodynia may hint at a shift of activation from tonically active sensory systems, like visual and vestibular cortices, into somatosensory-related brain areas.
@result synergy between the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and the human recombinant alpha-galactosidase a in cultured fibroblasts from patients with fabry disease in spite of the progress in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (lsds), in some of these disorders the available therapies show limited efficacy and a need exists to identify novel therapeutic strategies. we studied the combination of enzyme replacement and enzyme enhancement by pharmacological chaperones in pompe disease (pd), a metabolic myopathy caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal acid α-glucosidase. we showed that coincubation of pompe fibroblasts with recombinant human α-glucosidase and the chaperone n-butyldeoxynojirimycin (nb-dnj) resulted in more efficient correction of enzyme activity. the chaperone improved α-glucosidase delivery to lysosomes, enhanced enzyme maturation, and increased enzyme stability. improved enzyme correction was also found in vivo in a mouse model of pd treated with coadministration of single infusions of recombinant human α-glucosidase and oral nb-dnj. the enhancing effect of chaperones on recombinant enzymes was also observed in fibroblasts from another lysosomal disease, fabry disease, treated with recombinant α-galactosidase a and the specific chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj). these results have important clinical implications, as they demonstrate synergy between pharmacological chaperones and enzyme replacement. a synergistic effect of these treatments may result particularly useful in patients responding poorly to therapy and in tissues in which sufficient enzyme levels are difficult to obtain.
@method where are linear feature extraction methods applicable? we develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. we take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3d linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a lambertian surface without shadowing. however, since faces are not truly lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. our projection method is based on fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. the eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed "fisherface" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the harvard and yale face databases.
@method understanding uncertainties in non-linear population trajectories: a bayesian semi-parametric hierarchical approach to large-scale surveys of coral cover photosystem ii (psii) herbicides are used in large quantities on agricultural lands adjoining the great barrier reef (gbr). routine monitoring at 14 sites in inshore waters of the gbr using passive sampling techniques detected diuron (32-94% of sampling periods) at maximum concentrations of 1.7-430ng l(-1) in the relatively pristine cape york region to the mackay whitsunday region, respectively. a psii herbicide equivalent (psii-heq) index developed as an indicator for reporting was dominated by diuron (average contribution 89%) and typically increased during the wet season. the maximum psii-heq indicates the potential for photosynthetic inhibition of diatoms, seagrass and coral-symbionts. psii herbicides were significantly positively correlated with remotely sensed coloured dissolved organic matter, a proxy for freshwater extent. combining these methods provides for the first time the potential to cost-effectively monitor improvements in water quality entering the gbr with respect to exposure to psii herbicides.
@background genetically engineered frameshifted yopn-tyea chimeras influence type iii secretion system function in yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenic yersinia species employ type iii machines to target effector yops into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. yersinia tyea mutants are thought to be defective in the targeting of yope and yoph without affecting the injection of yopm, yopn, yopo, yopp, and yopt into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. one model suggests that tyea may form a tether between yopn (lcre) and yopd on the bacterial surface, a structure that may translocate yope and yoph across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells (m. iriarte, m. p. sory, a. boland, a. p. boyd, s. d. mills, i. lambermont, and g. r. cornelis, embo j. 17:1907-1918, 1998). we have examined the injection of yop proteins by tyea mutant yersiniae with the digitonin fractionation technique. we find that tyea mutant yersiniae not only secreted yope, yoph, yopm, and yopn into the extracellular medium but also targeted these polypeptides into the cytosol of hela cells. protease protection, cell fractionation, and affinity purification experiments suggest that tyea is located intracellularly and binds to yopn or yopd. we propose a model whereby tyea functions as a negative regulator of the type iii targeting pathway in the cytoplasm of yersiniae, presumably by preventing the export of yopn.
@result relationships between feeding behaviour and feed intake in dairy cows during early lactation the suitability of a statistical model for describing within-day feeding behavior, and potential relationships between model parameters and commonly measured experimental variables were examined. forty multiparous, midlactation holstein cows were fed using a real-time control system to record the date of each visit to a feeder, entrance time, exit time, and feed consumed over a 6-wk period. daily feed consumption, number of visits, meal duration, and within-visit rate of food intake were then calculated. two peaks in within-day rates of feed intake were indicated, suggesting that feeding activity was randomly distributed around each peak, that is, binormal. parameters describing the distributions (means, standard deviations, and the percentage of total feeding activity associated with each peak) were estimated. an adjusted average of 91% of the variation in within-day feeding activity was explained by the binormal model. relationships between model parameters and commonly measured experimental variables were also identified; behavioral traits were correlated with total feed intake. feeding activity patterns in literature data were also amenable to reanalysis by the binormal model. lactating cows consistently exhibited a distinct diurnal pattern in feeding activity; they were most active near sunrise and again near sunset (crepuscular). effects of various management operations (e.g., feeding and milking times and frequencies, and lighting) on within-day feeding patterns remain to be established, although a statistical model for evaluating them is now available. the patterns may have important implications for scheduling management activities to maximize feed intake and production.
@background multiple site silicon-based probes for chronic recordings in freely moving rats: implantation, recording and histological verification the contribution of the various hippocampal regions to the maintenance of epileptic activity, induced by stimulation of the perforant path or commissural system, was examined in the awake rat. combination of multiple-site recordings with silicon probes, current source density analysis and unit recordings allowed for a high spatial resolution of the field events. following perforant path stimulation, seizures began in the dentate gyrus, followed by events in the ca3-ca1 regions. after commissural stimulation, rhythmic bursts in the ca3-ca1 circuitry preceded the activation of the dentate gyrus. correlation of events in the different subregions indicated that the sustained rhythmic afterdischarge (2-6 hz) could not be explained by a cycle-by-cycle excitation of principal cell populations in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. the primary afterdischarge always terminated in the ca1 region, followed by the dentate gyrus, ca3 region and the entorhinal cortex. the duration and pattern of the hippocampal afterdischarge was essentially unaffected by removal of the entorhinal cortex. the emergence of large population spike bursts coincided with a decreased discharge of interneurons in both ca1 and hilar regions. the majority of hilar interneurons displayed a strong amplitude decrement prior to the onset of population spike phase of the afterdischarge. these findings suggest that (i) afterdischarges can independently arise in the ca3-ca1 and entorhinal dentate gyrus circuitries, (ii) reverberation of excitation in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop is not critical for the maintenance of afterdischarges and (iii) decreased activity of the interneuronal network may release population bursting of principal cells.
@method time regained: when people stop a physical activity program, how does their time use change? a randomised controlled trial measurement in behavioural epidemiology depends on high resolution and precise and accurate measures of the behaviour of interest. few questionnaires in the adult population are able to simultaneously collect the multidimensional information that is emerging as being important in the relationship between behaviour and health. this project had two objectives: (1) to develop an adult version of the computer-delivered multimedia activity recall for children and adolescents (marca), a 24-h activity recall instrument that can measure use-of-time and estimate energy expenditure and (2) to determine the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the developed adult marca. thirty-eight healthy subjects (mean±sd, 31.7±12.1 yr) completed two recalls of the adult marca within 24-h and accelerometer counts were measured on 30 of the subjects. bland-altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients (icc) were used to quantify the test-retest reliability of the adult marca. spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho) were used to quantify convergent validity of the adult marca compared to accelerometer counts. the test-retest reliability coefficients of the adult marca were high with intra-class coefficients ranging from 0.99 to 1.00. moderate to strong validity was observed for physical activity level (pal) (met.min score of accelerometer wear time) and accelerometer counts per minute (rho=0.72). the adult marca is a valid and reliable self-report measure of use-of-time and energy expenditure, capable of a wide variety of flexible use-of-time analyses related to a wide range of behaviours.
@result the impact of childhood emotional abuse and experiential avoidance on maladaptive problem solving and intimate partner violence the problem of domestic violence is widespread, with research indicating men and women both perpetrate a substantial amount of aggression. however, aggression perpetrated by women is a relatively understudied area compared to aggression perpetrated by men. additionally, research is needed to determine the correlates of aggression perpetration among women, as this can inform more effective treatment programs. thus, the current study sought to examine the association between trait anger and impulsivity and the perpetration of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (ipv) and general aggression among women arrested for domestic violence (n = 80). findings indicated that both trait anger and impulsivity were significantly associated with aggression perpetration and trait anger mediated the relationship between impulsivity and aggression perpetration. directions for future research and violence intervention programs are discussed.
@background dna damage-induced foci of e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme are detectable upon co-transfection with an interacting e3 ubiquitin ligase dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. we showed previously that rnf8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at dsbs. here, we provide evidence that, while rnf8 is necessary to trigger the dsb-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. we identified rnf168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. we show that rnf168 interacts with ubiquitylated h2a, assembles at dsbs in an rnf8-dependent manner, and, by targeting h2a and h2ax, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53bp1 and brca1. thus, rnf168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between e3 ligases in genome maintenance.
@method what factors are associated with adolescents' school break time physical activity and sedentary time? abstract objective: to develop an internationally acceptable definition of child overweight and obesity, specifying the measurement, the reference population, and the age and sex specific cut off points. design: international survey of six large nationally representative cross sectional growth studies. setting: brazil, great britain, hong kong, the netherlands, singapore, and the united states subjects: 97 876 males and 94 851 females from birth to 25 years of age main outcome measure: body mass index (weight/height2). results: for each of the surveys, centile curves were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used cut off points of 25 and 30 kg/m2 for adult overweight and obesity. the resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut off points from 2-18 years. conclusions: the proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in children.
@background the rna world as a model system to study the origin of life there is very significant evidence that cognate codons and/or anticodons are unexpectedly frequent in rna-binding sites for seven of eight biological amino acids that have been tested. this suggests that a substantial fraction of the genetic code has a stereochemical basis, the triplets having escaped from their original function in amino acid-binding sites to become modern codons and anticodons. we explicitly show that this stereochemical basis is consistent with subsequent optimization of the code to minimize the effect of coding mistakes on protein structure. these data also strengthen the argument for invention of the genetic code in an rna world and for the rna world itself.
@background selective contractile dysfunction of left, not right, ventricular myocardium in the shhf rat. myocardial failure in dilated cardiomyopathy may result from subcellular alterations in contractile protein function, excitation-contraction coupling processes, or recovery metabolism. we used isometric force and heat measurements to quantitatively investigate these subcellular systems in intact left ventricular muscle strips from nonfailing human hearts (n = 14) and from hearts with end-stage failing dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 13). in the failing myocardium, peak isometric twitch tension, maximum rate of tension rise, and maximum rate of relaxation were reduced by 46% (p = 0.013), 51% (p = 0.003), and 46% (p = 0.018), respectively (37 degrees c, 60 beats per minute). tension-dependent heat, reflecting the number of crossbridge interactions during the isometric twitch, was reduced by 61% in the failing myocardium (p = 0.006). in terms of the individual crossbridge cycle, the average crossbridge force-time integral was increased by 33% (p = 0.04) in the failing myocardium. in the nonfailing myocardium, the crossbridge force-time integral was positively correlated with the patient's age (r = 0.86, p less than 0.02), whereas there was no significant correlation with age in the failing group. the amount and rate of excitation-contraction coupling-related heat evolution (tension-independent heat) were reduced by 69% (p = 0.24) and 71% (p = 0.028), respectively, in the failing myocardium, reflecting a considerable decrease in the amount of calcium released and in the rate of calcium removal. the efficiency of the metabolic recovery process, as assessed by the ratio of initial heat to total activity-related heat, was similar in failing and nonfailing myocardium (0.54 +/- 0.03 versus 0.50 +/- 0.02, p = 0.23).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
@background the effect of internal mammary artery grafts on long-term clinical outcomes after coronary bypass surgery objectives the purpose of the present study is to report the five-year follow-up results of the eraci ii trial.   background immediate and one-year follow-up results of the eraci ii study showed a prognosis advantage of percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with stents over coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg).   methods a total of 450 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either pci (n = 225); or cabg (n = 225). only patients with multi-vessel disease were enrolled. clinical follow-up during five years was obtained in 92% of the total population after hospital discharge. the primary end point of the study was to compare freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years of follow-up.   results at five years of follow-up, patients initially treated with pci had similar survival and freedom from non-fatal acute myocardial infarction than those initially treated with cabg (92.8% vs. 88.4% and 97.3% vs. 94% respectively, p = 0.16). freedom from repeat revascularization procedures (pci/cabg) was significantly lower with pci compared with cabg (71.5% vs. 92.4%, p = 0.0002). freedom from mace was also significantly lower with pci compared with cabg (65.3% vs. 76.4%; p = 0.013). at five years similar numbers of patients randomized to each revascularization procedure were asymptomatic or with class i angina.   conclusions at five years of follow-up, in the eraci ii study, there were no survival benefits from any revascularization procedure; however patients initially treated with cabg had better freedom from repeat revascularization procedures and from mace.
@background infusing neuroscience into the study and prevention of drug misuse and co-occurring aggressive behavior stress causes rapid and transient expression of immediate early genes (iegs) in the brain, and the monitoring of iegs has enabled the visualization of the neurocircuitry of stress. previous studies have postulated that stressors can be divided into two categories; processive and systemic. the neural circuits of brain activation differ between the two kinds of stressors. for example, processive stressors, such as immobilization (imo), induce c-fos mrna first in the cortical and limbic areas and then in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pvh), while c-fos expression in the pvh precedes that in other areas in animals subjected to systemic stressors. we further show that prior exposure to imo stress for 6 days, or implantation of corticosterone pellets suppresses the induction of c-fos, fos b, jun b and ngfi-b, but not that of ngfi-a in the rat pvh. plasma glucocorticoid may be an important factor regulating stress-induced ieg expression. it is well known that ap-1 and glucocorticoid receptors (gr) interact and suppress each other. thus, decreased ap-1 levels in chronically stressed animals may help enhance the negative feedback effects of gr and prevent hypersecretion of glucocorticoid, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. imo stress induces rapid expression of c-fos, c-jun and ngfi-a mrnas in the heart and stomach. these were observed in the ventricular myocardium and coronary arteries, and in the epithelium, smooth muscles and arteries of the stomach after 30 min of imo. ieg expression in the peripheral organs may provide a molecular basis for stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.
@background ameliorative effect of lycopene effect on cisplatin-induced nephropathy in patient background: nephrotoxicity is the major side-effect of cisplatin (cddp), and it is reported to be gender-related. we evaluated the effects of pomegranate flower extract (pfe) as an antioxidant on cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats. methods: twenty-three adult female rats in four groups treated as following. groups 1 and 2 received pfe at doses of 25 and 50 (mg/kg/day), respectively, for 9 days, and from day 3 on, they also received cisplatin (cddp) (2.5 mg/kg) daily. group 3 was treated as group 1 expects saline instead of pfe, and group 4 received pfe (25 mg/kg/day) alone. results: cisplatin alone increased the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and nitrite; and kidney tissue damage score and kidney weight. however, pfe not only did not ameliorate the induced nephrotoxicity, but also aggravated renal tissue damage. conclusions: pomegranate extract as an antioxidant did not ameliorate cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats.
@background nature and variants of idiopathic restless legs syndrome: observations from 152 patients referred to secondary care in the uk objectives to assess the frequency, impact, and medical response to the restless legs syndrome (rls) in a large multi-national primary care population.   method questionnaire surveys of matched patients and primary care physicians (pcps) in five modern industrialized western countries.   results an rls screening questionnaire was completed by 23,052 patients: 2223 (9.6%) reported weekly rls symptoms; 1557 of these patients had medical follow-up questionnaires completed both by themselves and by their physician. an rls sufferer subgroup (n=551) likely warranting treatment was defined as reporting at least twice weekly symptoms with appreciable negative impact on quality of life. a total of 88.4% of rls sufferers reported at least one sleep-related symptom. most reported impaired sleep consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia. out of 551 sufferers, 357 (64.8%) reported consulting a physician about their rls symptoms, but only 46 of these 357 (12.9%) reported having been given a diagnosis. pcps reported that 209 (37.9%) rls sufferers consulted them about rls symptoms, but only 52 (24.9%) were given an rls diagnosis. in most countries, sufferers, regardless of diagnosis, were prescribed therapies not known to be effective in rls.   conclusions rls significantly impairs patients' lives, often by severely disrupting sleep. the marked under-diagnosis and inappropriate treatment of rls indicates that pcps need better education about this condition. recognizing how often disrupted sleep results from rls should improve diagnosis.
@method suppression of arbuscule degeneration in medicago truncatula phosphate transporter4 mutants is dependent on the ammonium transporter 2 family protein amt2;3 arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis is a widespread mutualism formed between vascular plants and fungi of the glomeromycota. in this endosymbiosis, fungal hyphae enter the roots, growing through epidermal cells to the cortex where they establish differentiated hyphae called arbuscules in the cortical cells. reprogramming of the plant epidermal and cortical cells occurs to enable intracellular growth of the fungal symbiont; however, the plant genes underlying this process are largely unknown. here, through the use of rnai, we demonstrate that the expression of a medicago truncatula gene named vapyrin is essential for arbuscule formation, and also for efficient epidermal penetration by am fungi. vapyrin is induced transiently in the epidermis coincident with hyphal penetration, and then in the cortex during arbuscule formation. the vapyrin protein is cytoplasmic, and in cells containing am fungal hyphae, the protein accumulates in small puncta that move through the cytoplasm. vapyrin is a novel protein composed of two domains that mediate protein-protein interactions: an n-terminal vamp-associated protein (vap)/major sperm protein (msp) domain and a c-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain. putative vapyrin orthologs exist widely in the plant kingdom, but not in arabidopsis, or in non-plant species. the data suggest a role for vapyrin in cellular remodeling to support the intracellular development of fungal hyphae during am symbiosis.
@background sororin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by antagonizing wapl cohesin's smc1, smc3, and scc1 subunits form a tripartite ring that entraps sister dnas. scc3, pds5, and rad61 (wapl) are regulatory subunits that control this process. we describe here smc3, scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutations that permit yeast cell proliferation and entrapment of sister dnas by cohesin rings in the absence of eco1, an acetyl transferase normally essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion. the smc3 mutations cluster around and include a highly conserved lysine (k113) close to smc3's atp-binding pocket, which, together with k112, is acetylated by eco1. lethality caused by mutating both residues to arginine is suppressed by the scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutants. scc3, pds5, and rad61 form a complex and inhibit entrapment of sister dnas by a process involving the "k112/k113" surface on smc3's atpase. according to this model, eco1 promotes sister dna entrapment partly by relieving an antiestablishment activity associated with scc3, pds5, and rad61.
@background toxico-pathological changes induced by cypermethrin in broiler chicks: their attenuation with vitamin e and selenium. this study was carried out on 90 one-day-old broiler chicks to know clinico-hematological alterations, dna damage caused by cypermethrin (cy), and attenuation of toxic effects by vitamin e (vit e) and selenium (se). birds were randomly divided into five equal groups. groups 1-4 received cy (600mlkg(-1)b.wt) daily for 30 days by crop tubing. in addition to cy, groups 2, 3 and 4 received vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt), se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), and vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt)+se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), respectively. group 5 served as control. birds were monitored twice daily for clinical signs. they were weighed and blood samples were collected at experimental days 10, 20 and 30 for hematological studies. cy-treated birds showed more prominent signs of toxicity compared to cy+vit e, cy+se and cy+vit e+se birds. body weight in groups 1-3 was significantly (p<0.05) smaller at days 20 and 30 when compared with the control group. significantly (p<0.001) higher numbers of micronuclei appeared in chicks treated with cy compared to cy+vit e- and cy+se-treated birds. significantly decreased total erythrocyte counts (tec), hemoglobin (hb) concentration and packed cell volume (pcv) in all treated groups were recorded. treated birds suffered from macrocytic hypochromic anemia. leukocytosis in early stage and later leucopenia was seen in treated birds. it can be concluded that cy induces toxic effects in broilers chicks; however, these toxic effects can be ameliorated by vit e or se. combination of vit e and se was more effective to ameliorate toxic effects of cypermethrin.
@background coil-assisted rfa of poorly visible liver tumors: effectiveness and risk factors of local tumor progression new techniques of ct-guided management were introduced to ablate ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas. in six patients with hcc, a total of six nodules (8–30 mm in diameter) were treated under the guidance of ct. these lesions were not visualized by sonography but were visualized as lipiodol spots on ct after chemoembolization. tumor localization was successful in all patients without difficulty, using a thin needle or hookwire under the guidance of ct. two patients underwent subsequent hepatic resection and/or microwave coagulation therapy (mct) through a small incision after hookwire placement. four patients received percutaneous mct (n = 2) or ethanol injection (pei) (n = 2) at the time of localization. the postoperative ct with contrast enhancement indicated that tumor ablation was complete in four of the five nodules treated with mct or pei. however, in one nodule (30 mm in diameter) treated with pei, tumor ablation was not complete. there were no complications. there has been no local tumor recurrence 6–46 months after treatment in any of the patients. in conclusion, these ct-guided procedures were effective in treating ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas that otherwise would have remained untreated.

@method using inverse planning for personalized feedback watching another person take actions to complete a goal and making inferences about that person's knowledge is a relatively natural task for people. this ability can be especially important in educational settings, where the inferences can be used for assessment, diagnosing misconceptions, and providing informative feedback. in this paper, we develop a general framework for automatically making such inferences based on observed actions; this framework is particularly relevant for inferring student knowledge in educational games and other interactive virtual environments. our approach relies on modeling action planning: we formalize the problem as a markov decision process in which one must choose what actions to take to complete a goal, where choices will be dependent on one's beliefs about how actions affect the environment. we use a variation of inverse reinforcement learning to infer these beliefs. through two lab experiments, we show that this model can recover people's beliefs in a simple environment, with accuracy comparable to that of human observers. we then demonstrate that the model can be used to provide real-time feedback and to model data from an existing educational game.
@background histopathologic correlation of aspergillus endophthalmitis following uncomplicated cataract surgery purpose to report a series of patients with early onset aspergillus endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.   design retrospective consecutive case series.   methods medical records were reviewed of all cases of endophthalmitis caused by aspergillus after cataract surgery treated at the authors' practices between 1992 and 2005.   results five patients were identified. two patients were immunocompromised (one on oral corticosteroids and one on chemotherapy for lung cancer). the mean number of days between cataract surgery and diagnosis with endophthalmitis was 29 (range, 10 to 62 days). three eyes (60%) were enucleated despite a variety of treatments. in addition to vitrectomy and injection of antifungal agents, the other two eyes underwent surgical debridement of a localized necrotic nidus. final visual acuity was 20/30 in one eye and 20/200 in the remaining eye.   conclusions aspergillus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. visual outcomes are generally poor and enucleation is common in these patients.
@background nonsense mediated decay resistant mutations are a source of expressed mutant proteins in colon cancer cell lines with microsatellite instability high level microsatellite instability (msi-h) occurs in about 15% of colorectal cancer (crcs), either as sporadic cancers or in the context of hereditary non-polyposis cancer or lynch syndrome. in msi-h crc, mismatch repair deficiency leads to insertion/deletion mutations at coding microsatellites and thus to the translation of frameshift peptides (fsps). fsps are potent inductors of t cell responses in vitro and in vivo. the present study aims at the identification of fsp-specific humoral immune responses in msi-h crc and lynch syndrome. sera from patients with history of msi-h crc (n = 69), healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 52) were analyzed for antibodies against fsps using peptide elisa. reactivities were measured against fsps derived from genes frequently mutated in msi-h crcs, aim2, tgfbr2, casp5, taf1b, znf294, and marcks. antibody reactivity against fsps was significantly higher in msi-h crc patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.036, mann–whitney) and highest in patients with shortest interval between tumor resection and serum sampling. humoral immune responses in patients were most frequently directed against fsps derived from mutated taf1b (11.6%, 8/69) and tgfbr2 (10.1%, 7/69). low level fsp-specific antibodies were also detected in healthy mutation carriers. our results show that antibody responses against fsps are detectable in msi-h crc patients and healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers. based on the high number of defined fsp antigens, measuring fsp-specific humoral immune responses is a highly promising tool for future diagnostic application in msi-h cancer patients.
@background amniotic fluid chemokines and autism spectrum disorders: an exploratory study utilizing a danish historic birth cohort background the danish medical birth registry (mbr) was established in 1968 and has been computerized since 1973. the primary purpose of the registration is to monitor the health of the newborns and of the quality of the antenatal and delivery care services, but the registry is increasingly being used in research. major changes in registration have taken place in 1978 and 1991. the paper describes the content and usage of the mbr over time and suggests research topics for the future.   results a broad scope of studies illustrates how the mbr has been used, either as single data source, linked with data from other registries or with data from interviews or self-completed questionnaires. validations have shown variations in the quality of data, depending on source, and have underlined the need for constant quality control. any access to data at the individual level is subjected to special provisions laid down by the data surveillance authority and also requires a permission from the national board of health.   conclusions the time from conception to early childhood is an important period concerning future health for the individual. the danish medical birth registry is a valuable tool in this respect, which has not yet been used to its full potential in research or monitoring. experience indicates that the quality of the registry depends upon having a close link to the staff responsible for delivery services and thus having the necessary specialised skills and interest.
@result hdac inhibitor sodium butyrate-mediated epigenetic regulation enhances neuroprotective function of microglia during ischemic stroke in the healthy adult brain, neurogenesis normally occurs in the subventricular zone (svz) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (dg). cerebral ischemia enhances neurogenesis in neurogenic and non‐neurogenic regions of the ischemic brain of adult rodents. this study demonstrated that post‐insult treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate (sb), stimulated the incorporation of bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (brdu) in the svz, dg, striatum, and frontal cortex in the ischemic brain of rats subjected to permanent cerebral ischemia. sb treatment also increased the number of cells expressing polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule, nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phospho‐camp response element‐binding protein (creb), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) in various brain regions after cerebral ischemia. furthermore, extensive co‐localization of brdu and polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule was observed in multiple regions after ischemia, and sb treatment up‐regulated protein levels of bdnf, phospho‐creb, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. intraventricular injection of k252a, a tyrosine kinase b receptor antagonist, markedly reduced sb‐induced cell proliferation detected by brdu and ki67 in the ipsilateral svz, dg, and other brain regions, blocked sb‐induced nestin expression and creb activation, and attenuated the long‐lasting behavioral benefits of sb. together, these results suggest that histone deacetylase inhibitor‐induced cell proliferation, migration and differentiation require bdnf–tyrosine kinase b signaling and may contribute to long‐term beneficial effects of sb after ischemic injury.
@method emotional intelligence: an integrative meta-analysis and cascading model. a common research problem is the estimation of the population correlation between x and y from an observed correlation rxy obtained from a sample that has been restricted because of some sample selection process. methods of correcting sample correlations for range restriction in a limited set of conditions are well-known. an expanded classification scheme for range-restriction scenarios is developed that conceptualizes range-restriction scenarios from various combinations of the following facets: (a) the variable(s) on which selection occurs (x, y and/or a 3rd variable z), (b) whether unrestricted variances for the relevant variables are known, and (c) whether a 3rd variable, if involved, is measured or unmeasured. on the basis of these facets, the authors describe potential solutions for 11 different range-restriction scenarios and summarize research to date on these techniques.
@background transgenic cotton plants expressing double-stranded rnas target hmg-coa reductase (hmgr) gene inhibits the growth, development and survival of cotton bollworms abstract transgenic maize, zea mays l., event tc1507 produces the cry1f protein to provide protection from feeding by several important lepidopteran pests, including spodoptera frugiperda (j.e. smith) (lepidoptera: noctuidae). reports of reduced field performance against this species in puerto rico were investigated, and laboratory bioassays showed that s. frugiperda collected from the affected area exhibited lower sensitivity to the cry1f protein compared with typical colonies from other regions. the resistance was shown to be autosomally inherited and highly recessive. the puerto rico colony was shown to be moderately less sensitive than susceptible laboratory strains to cry1ab and cry1ac, but the differences in sensitivity were dramatically smaller than for cry1f. potential contributory factors to the emergence of resistance to cry1f in puerto rico populations of s. frugiperda include the tropical island geography, unusually large population sizes in 2006, and drought conditions reducing the availability of alternative hosts. in response to this resistance incident, the technology providers have stopped commercial sales of tc1507 maize in puerto rico pending potential reversion to susceptibility.
@background effect of bovine somatotropin on the lactational and reproductive performance of lactating dairy cows - a review the galactopoietic effect of daily injections, for five day periods, of growth hormone was examined by measuring milk yield, mammary blood flow and arteriovenous differences of glucose and amino acids on 12 occasions in four goats. in 10 periods there were marked increases (mean 18.1%) in mammary blood flow (8 statistically significant) and less-marked increases (mean 8.0%) in milk yield (6 statistically significant). on 8 of the occasions on which it was measured the maximum blood plasma growth hormone concentration was increased to more than 8 ng/ml. there were no statistically significant changes in mammary arteriovenous concentration differences of glucose or amino acids in response to growth hormone injections. it is suggested that, contrary to the usual situation in which the rate of mammary blood flow appears to be regulated by the metabolic activity of the gland, the galactopoietic response to growth hormone may be a consequence of elevated blood flow, which increases the supply to the gland of rate-limiting metabolic substrates.
@background the sushi domains of gabab receptors function as axonal targeting signals little is known about presynaptic assembly during central nervous system synaptogenesis. here we used time-lapse fluorescence imaging, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to study hippocampal neuronal cultures transfected with a fusion construct of the presynaptic vesicle protein vamp and green fluorescent protein. our results suggest that major cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein precursors of the presynaptic active zone are transported along developing axons together as discrete packets. retrospective electron microscopy demonstrated varied vesicular and tubulovesicular membrane structures. packets containing these heterogeneous structures were stabilized specifically at new sites of dendrite- and axon-initiated cell–cell contact; within less than one hour, evoked vesicle recycling was observed at these putative nascent synapses. these observations suggest that substantial membrane remodeling may be necessary to produce the uniform vesicles typical of the mature active zone, and that many presynaptic proteins may be united early in their biogenesis and sorting pathways.
@method exact2: the semantics of biomedical protocols motivation: many published manuscripts contain experiment protocols which are poorly described or deficient in information. this means that the published results are very hard or impossible to repeat. this problem is being made worse by the increasing complexity of high-throughput/automated methods. there is therefore a growing need to represent experiment protocols in an efficient and unambiguous way. results: we have developed the experiment actions (exact) ontology as the basis of a method of representing biological laboratory protocols. we provide example protocols that have been formalized using exact, and demonstrate the advantages and opportunities created by using this formalization. we argue that the use of exact will result in the publication of protocols with increased clarity and usefulness to the scientific community. availability: the ontology, examples and code can be downloaded from http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/research/bio/dss/exact/ contact: larisa soldatova lss@aber.ac.uk
@method nv-dedup: high-performance inline deduplication for non-volatile memory next-generation non-volatile memories (nvms) promise dram-like performance, persistence, and high density. they can attach directly to processors to form non-volatile main memory (nvmm) and offer the opportunity to build very low-latency storage systems. these high-performance storage systems would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments where reliability and availability are critical. however, providing reliability and availability to nvmm is challenging, since the latency of data replication can overwhelm the low latency that nvmm should provide. we propose mojim, a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require, while preserving the performance of nvmm. mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains a mirrored pair of nodes and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data. mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks to minimize replication costs and expose as much of nvmm?s performance as possible. we evaluate mojim using raw dram as a proxy for nvmm and using an industrial nvmm emulation system. we find that mojim provides replicated nvmm with similar or even better performance than un-replicated nvmm (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 to 2.7x the throughput). we demonstrate that replacing mongodb's built-in replication system with mojim improves mongodb's performance by 3.4 to 4x.
@method dna prime protein boost strategies protect cattle from bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 challenge. the immunogenicity of a poylvalent hiv-1 vaccine comprised of env antigens from primary r5 isolates was evaluated in rhesus macaques. dna vaccines encoding four env antigens from multiple hiv-1 subtypes and hiv-1 gag antigen from a single subtype elicited a persistent level of binding antibodies to gp120 from multiple hiv-1 isolates that were markedly enhanced following boosting with homologous gp120 proteins in qs-21 adjuvant irrespective of the route of dna immunization. these sera neutralized homologous and, to a lesser degree, heterologous hiv-1 isolates. four of the six immunized animals were completely protected following rectal challenge with a shiv encoding env from hiv-1(ba-l), whereas the virus load was reduced in the remaining animals compared to naïve controls. hence priming with dna encoding env antigens from multiple hiv-1 clades followed by boosting with homologous env proteins elicits anti-hiv-1 immune responses capable of protecting macaques against mucosal transmission of r5 tropic shiv isolate.
@background neural substrates of abstinence-induced cigarette cravings in chronic smokers most advances in addiction treatment to date have addressed the physical dependence and withdrawal that accompany addiction to some drugs of abuse. in contrast, it has proven more difficult to develop medications that effectively treat drug craving and relapse, the core features of addictive disorders. current efforts focus on developing medications that prevent a drug from getting to its protein target, that mimic drug action and thereby partially alleviate drug craving, or that affect the addiction process per se. the latter approach is the most speculative, but also the most promising in terms of translating basic knowledge of addiction into clinical progress.
@background genetic characterization of porcine circovirus type 2 from pigs with porcine circovirus associated diseases in argentina neonatal gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated with tissue homogenates and low- and high-passage cell culture material to determine if the lesions of the newly described porcine postweaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (pmws) could be reproduced. for this, 17 3-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated intranasally with pelleted chloroform-treated, filtered extracts from cell cultures, filter-sterilized homogenates of lymphoid tissue from pmws-affected piglets, or control materials. piglets were maintained in germ-free isolators for up to 5 weeks after infection prior to euthanasia and collection of samples for analysis. all piglets inoculated with the viral inocula developed lesions typical of pmws, including generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, nephritis, interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and gastritis. porcine circovirus (pcv), as well as porcine parvovirus (ppv), was detected in tissues by virus reisolation, polymerase chain reaction analysis, or immunohistochemistry. all infected piglets developed moderate to high titers of antibody to pcv and moderate titers to ppv. no lesions, virus, or virus-specific antibodies were detected in sham-inoculated or uninoculated control piglets. these studies demonstrate that the lesions of pmws can be experimentally reproduced in gnotobiotic piglets using filterable viral agents derived from pigs with pmws and provide an experimental basis for further investigation into the pathogenesis and control of this emerging infectious disease in swine.
@method comparison of gene expression signatures of diamide, h2o2 and menadione exposed aspergillus nidulans cultures – linking genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology this report describes a new method for simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins from cell and tissue samples. the method is based on the use of a reagent containing phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. a biological sample is homogenized in the reagent and the simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins is accomplished in a single step by a liquid-phase separation. the isolation of rna can be completed in about 1 h, and dna and proteins in about 3 h. the simultaneously isolated rna, dna and proteins are ready for northern, southern and western blotting. the complete recovery of dna from samples used for the rna and protein isolation makes it possible to normalize the results of gene expression studies based on dna content instead of on the more variable total rna, protein content or tissue weight.
@method saccharomyces boulardii improves intestinal epithelial cell restitution by inhibiting αvβ5 integrin activation state crosstalk between integrins is involved in the regulation of various cell functions including cell migration. here we identify the interplay between the integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 and alpha2beta1 during cell migration toward type i collagen. human colon cancer cell lines ht29-d4 and sw480 were used as cell models. to improve our understanding of the consequences of alphavbeta5/beta6 function on alpha2beta1, we decreased the expression of alphav integrins by either sirna or lysosomal targeting strategies or inhibited their function using, as antagonists, blocking antibodies or disintegrins. in all cases, we observed a greatly enhanced alpha2beta1 integrin-dependent cell migration associated with focal adhesion rearrangements and increased outside-in signaling as demonstrated by elevated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mapkinase (erk1 and erk2). the alphavbeta5/beta6-dependent limitation of alpha2beta1 function could be overridden by ts2/16, an activating anti-beta1 antibody. interestingly, compared to control cells, the pharmacological inhibition of pi3kinase or the sirna-mediated knockdown of akt had little effect on the high alpha2beta1-mediated cell migration observed in the absence of alphav integrins or following activation of alpha2beta1 integrins by the ts2/16. these results suggest that integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 repress alpha2beta1 possibly by interfering with their activation process and thereby modify the cell signaling regulation of alpha2beta1-mediated migration.
@result tms modulation of visual and auditory processing in the posterior parietal cortex although the importance of the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions in spatial localization of visual stimuli is well established, their role in auditory space perception is less clear. using positron emission tomography (pet) during auditory and visual spatial localization in the same subjects, modality-specific areas were identified in the superior parietal lobule, middle temporal and lateral prefrontal cortices. these findings suggest that, similar to the visual system, the hierarchical organization of the auditory system extends beyond the temporal lobe to include areas in the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions specialized in auditory spatial processing. our results may explain the dissociation of visual and auditory spatial localization deficits following lesions involving these regions.
@background crossing the impassable: genetic connections in 20 reef fishes across the eastern pacific barrier intraspecific gene evolution cannot always be represented by a bifurcating tree. rather, population genealogies are often multifurcated, descendant genes coexist with persistent ancestors and recombination events produce reticulate relationships. whereas traditional phylogenetic methods assume bifurcating trees, several networking approaches have recently been developed to estimate intraspecific genealogies that take into account these population-level phenomena.
@background length of mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-stabilizing drugs determines cell death after mitotic exit the spindle checkpoint that monitors kinetochore–microtubule attachment has been implicated in tumorigenesis; however, the relation between the spindle checkpoint and cell death remains obscure. in bub1-deficient (but not mad2-deficient) cells, conditions that activate the spindle checkpoint (i.e., cold shock or treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag) induced dna fragmentation during early mitosis. this mitotic cell death was independent of caspase activation; therefore, we named it caspase-independent mitotic death (cimd). cimd depends on p73, a homologue of p53, but not on p53. cimd also depends on apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease g, which are effectors of caspase-independent cell death. treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag induced cimd in cell lines derived from colon tumors with chromosome instability, but not in cells from colon tumors with microsatellite instability. this result was due to low bub1 expression in the former cell lines. when bub1 is completely depleted, aneuploidy rather than cimd occurs. these results suggest that cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation might be eliminated via cimd.
@background the ubiquitous isoform of na/k-atpase (atp1a1) regulates junctional proteins, connexin 43 and claudin 11 via src-egfr-erk1/2-creb pathway in rat sertoli cells† in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd), cyst formation and enlargement require proliferation of mural renal epithelial cells and the transepithelial secretion of fluid into the cyst cavity. na,k-atpase is essential for solute and water transport in adpkd cells, and ouabain blocks fluid secretion in these cells. by binding to the na,k-atpase, ouabain also induces proliferation in some cell types. surprisingly, it was found that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain, similar to those circulating in blood, induced adpkd cell proliferation but had no statistically significant effect on normal human kidney (nhk) cells. ouabain, acting from the basolateral side of the cells, also caused an increase in the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk). mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126 blocked ouabain-induced erk activation and cell proliferation, suggesting that ouabain effect is mediated through the mek-erk pathway. in contrast to nhk cells, the dose-response curve for ouabain inhibition of na,k-atpase activity indicated that approximately 20% of the enzyme in adpkd cells exhibits a higher affinity for ouabain. the increased ouabain affinity of adpkd cells was not due to differences in na,k-atpase isoform expression because these cells, like nhk cells, possess only the alpha1 and beta1 subunits. the gamma variants of the na,k-atpase also are expressed in the cells but are elevated in adpkd cells. currently, the basis for the differences in ouabain sensitivity of nhk and adpkd cells is unknown. it is concluded that ouabain stimulates proliferation in adpkd cells by binding to the na,k-atpase with high affinity and via activation of the mek-erk pathway.
@background phenotype–genotype interactions on renal function in type 2 diabetes: an analysis using structural equation modelling cytokine‐induced inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). we investigated plasma concentrations and ex vivo production of cytokines and chemokines, and intracellular signalling molecules, mitogen‐activated protein kinases (mapk) in t helper (th) cells and monocytes in 94 type 2 diabetic patients with or without nephropathy and 20 healthy controls. plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (tnf)‐α, interleukin (il)‐6, il‐18 and chemokine ccl2 in patients with diabetic nephropathy (dn) were significantly higher than control subjects, while il‐10, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin concentrations of dn were significantly higher than patients without diabetic nephropathy (ndn) and control subjects (all p < 0·05). plasma concentrations of tnf‐α, il‐6, il‐10, il‐18, ccl2, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin exhibited significant positive correlation with urine albumin : creatinine ratio in dn patients. the percentage increases of ex vivo production of il‐6, cxcl8, cxcl10, ccl2 and ccl5 upon tnf‐α activation were significantly higher in both ndn and dn patients than controls (all p < 0·05). the percentage increases in il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (erk) in th cells of ndn and dn were significantly higher than controls (p < 0·05), while the percentage increase in tnf‐α‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in monocytes and il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in th cells and monocytes were significantly higher in ndn patients than controls. these results confirmed that the aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and differential activation of mapk in different leucocytes are the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of type 2 dm patients with dn.
@background laser-assisted three-dimensional surface modifications of titanium implants: preliminary data purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
@background retinal amino acid neurochemistry in health and disease excitation mapping is a method of visualizing the signaling history of neurons with permeant organic cations. it is compatible with high-resolution imaging, allowing concurrent visualization of all neuronal classes and their glutamate-gated excitation histories. excitation mapping documents the stability and precision of neuronal signaling within a given neuronal class, arguing that single unit electrophysiological sampling accurately reflects neuronal diversity. we here review the theory of excitation mapping, provide methods and protocol links; outline imaging concepts; provide parametric data on the temporal range and physiological sensitivity of excitation mapping; and show that immunocytochemical methods for macromolecules are compatible with excitation mapping.
@method leishmaniavirus-dependent metastatic leishmaniasis is prevented by blocking il-17a rna interference (rnai) pathways are widespread in metaozoans but the genes required show variable occurrence or activity in eukaryotic microbes, including many pathogens. while some leishmania lack rnai activity and argonaute or dicer genes, we show that leishmania braziliensis and other species within the leishmania subgenus viannia elaborate active rnai machinery. strong attenuation of expression from a variety of reporter and endogenous genes was seen. as expected, rnai knockdowns of the sole argonaute gene implicated this protein in rnai. the potential for functional genetics was established by testing rnai knockdown lines lacking the paraflagellar rod, a key component of the parasite flagellum. this sets the stage for the systematic manipulation of gene expression through rnai in these predominantly diploid asexual organisms, and may also allow selective rnai-based chemotherapy. functional evolutionary surveys of rnai genes established that rnai activity was lost after the separation of the leishmania subgenus viannia from the remaining leishmania species, a divergence associated with profound changes in the parasite infectious cycle and virulence. the genus leishmania therefore offers an accessible system for testing hypothesis about forces that may select for the loss of rnai during evolution, such as invasion by viruses, changes in genome plasticity mediated by transposable elements and gene amplification (including those mediating drug resistance), and/or alterations in parasite virulence.
@background low-dose dipyridamole infusion acutely increases exercise capacity in angina pectoris: a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover stress echocardiographic study. background coronary steal is defined as a fall in blood flow toward a certain vascular region in favor of another area during arteriolar vasodilatation, ie, a coronary flow velocity reserve (cfvr) <1. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of steal in patients with a wide range of collateral supply to a vascular area of interest and to assess whether steal is associated with the amount of collateral flow.   methods and results one hundred patients 57+/-9 years old with a coronary artery stenosis to be dilated were examined with intracoronary (ic) doppler guidewires. ic adenosine-induced cfvr<1 obtained distal to the stenosis was defined as steal. an index for collateral flow was determined by positioning the doppler guidewire in the collateral-dependent vessel distal to the stenosis and measuring the flow velocity time integral during (vi(occl), cm) and after (vi(ø-occl)) balloon occlusion. vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl) was determined without and with intravenous adenosine (140 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). coronary steal occurred in 10 of 100 patients. patients with steal showed superior collaterals compared with those without steal: vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl)=0.65+/-0.24 in patients with steal versus 0.29+/-0.18 in those without steal (p=.0001). in all patients with steal, there was a reduction in collateral flow during intravenous adenosine-induced hyperemia, whereas in the majority (70%) of patients without steal, collateral flow increased or remained unchanged during hyperemia.   conclusions coronary steal assessed by intracoronary doppler flow velocity measurements occurs in 10% of patients with a wide range of coronary collaterals to the vascular area from which blood flow is redistributed. there is a direct association between the presence of steal away from and the amount of collateral flow toward the region under investigation. collateral flow to the vascular region studied decreases during adenosine-induced hyperemia, which indicates a mechanism of steal via the extensive collaterals.
@method a novel strategy to produce sweeter tomato fruits with high sugar contents by fruit-specific expression of a single bzip transcription factor gene. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has revolutionised the rapid analysis of mammalian genomic dna (1). however, pcr is less useful in the analysis of plant dna due to the difficulties in extracting nucleic acids from limited amounts of plant tissue. we have developed a method for the rapid extraction of small amounts of plant genomic dna suitable for pcr analysis. the method is applicable to a variety of plant species and has the added advantage of not requiring any phenol or chloroform extraction. thus it is possible to complete an extraction within 15 minutes without handling any hazardous organic solvents. samples for pcr analysis (usually leaf tissue) are collected using the lid of a sterile eppendorf tube to pinch out a disc of material into the tube. this ensures uniform sample size and also reduces the possibilities of contamination arising from handling the tissue. dna is extracted as follows: the tissue is macerated (using disposable grinders from bel-art products: scienceware, pequannock, nj, 07440 usa. catalog no 992) in the original eppendorf tube at room temperature, without buffer, for 15 seconds. 400 yl of extraction buffer (200 mm tris hc1 ph 7.5, 250 mm nacl, 25 mm edta, 0.5% sds) is added and the sample vortexed for 5 seconds. this mixture can then be left at room temperature until all the samples have been extracted (> 1 hour). the extracts are centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and 300 y\ of the supernatant transferred to a fresh eppendorf tube. this supernatant is mixed with 300 /il isopropanol and left at room temperature for 2 minutes. following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the pellet is vacuum dried and dissolved in 100 /xl 1xte. this dna is stable at 4°c for greater than one year. 2.5 yx of this sample is sufficient for a standard 50 y\ pcr (figure 1). when older tissue is used this may be increased to 25 /xl without any deleterious effect on the pcr. using this protocol we have found it possible to process hundreds of individual samples in a single working day.
@background effect of vitamin c on prevention of complex regional pain syndrome type i in foot and ankle surgery. this is a multisite study examining the internal validity and comprehensiveness of the international association for the study of pain (iasp) diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (crps). a standardized sign/symptom checklist was used in patient evaluations to obtain data on crps-related signs and symptoms in a series of 123 patients meeting iasp criteria for crps. principal components factor analysis (pca) was used to detect statistical groupings of signs/symptoms (factors). crps signs and symptoms grouped together statistically in a manner somewhat different than in current iasp/crps criteria. as in current criteria, a separate pain/sensation criterion was supported. however, unlike in current criteria, pca indicated that vasomotor symptoms form a factor distinct from a sudomotor/edema factor. changes in range of motion, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes, which are not included in the iasp criteria, formed a distinct fourth factor. scores on the pain/sensation factor correlated positively with pain duration (p , 0:001), but there was a negative correlation between the sudomotor/edema factor scores and pain duration (p , 0:05). the motor/trophic factor predicted positive responses to sympathetic block (p , 0:05). these results suggest that the internal validity of the iasp/crps criteria could be improved by separating vasomotor signs/symptoms (e.g. temperature and skin color asymmetry) from those re ̄ecting sudomotor dysfunction (e.g. sweating changes) and edema. results also indicate motor and trophic changes may be an important and distinct component of crps which is not currently incorporated in the iasp criteria. an experimental revision of crps diagnostic criteria for research purposes is proposed. implications for diagnostic sensitivity and speci®city are discussed. q 1999 international association for the study of pain. published by elsevier science b.v.
@method clinical assessment of effusion in knee osteoarthritis—a systematic review objectives: to assess the prevalence of inflammation in subjects with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis (oa), as determined by the presence of synovitis or joint effusion at ultrasonography (us); and to evaluate the correlation between synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters. methods: a cross sectional, multicentre, european study was conducted under the umbrella of eular-escisit. subjects had primary chronic knee oa (acr criteria) with pain during physical activity ⩾30 mm for at least 48 hours. clinical parameters were collected by a rheumatologist and an us examination of the painful knee was performed by a radiologist or rheumatologist within 72 hours of the clinical examination. ultrasonographic synovitis was defined as synovial thickness ⩾4 mm and diffuse or nodular appearance, and a joint effusion was defined as effusion depth ⩾4 mm. results: 600 patients with painful knee oa were analysed. at us 16 (2.7%) had synovitis alone, 85 (14.2%) had both synovitis and effusion, 177 (29.5%) had joint effusion alone, and 322 (53.7%) had no inflammation according to the definitions employed. multivariate analysis showed that inflammation seen by us correlated statistically with advanced radiographic disease (kellgren-lawrence grade ⩾3; odds ratio (or) = 2.20 and 1.91 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively), and with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”, such as joint effusion on clinical examination (or = 1.97 and 2.70 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively) or sudden aggravation of knee pain (or = 1.77 for joint effusion). conclusion: us can detect synovial inflammation and effusion in painful knee oa, which correlate significantly with knee synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”.
@background genomic modifiers of natural killer cells, immune responsiveness and lymphoid tissue remodeling together increase host resistance to viral infection the goal of most vaccines is the induction of long-lived memory t and b cells capable of protecting the host from infection by cytotoxic mechanisms, cytokines and high-affinity antibodies. however, efforts to develop vaccines against major human pathogens like hiv and hcv have not been successful, thereby highlighting the need for novel approaches to circumvent immunoregulatory mechanisms that limit induction of protective immunity. here we show that mouse natural killer (nk) cells inhibit generation of long-lived virus-specific memory t- and b-cells as well as virus-specific antibody production after acute infection. mechanistically, nk cells suppressed cd4 t cells and follicular helper t cells (tfh) in a perforin-dependent manner during the first few days of infection, resulting in a weaker germinal center (gc) response and diminished immune memory. we anticipate that innovative strategies to relieve nk cell-mediated suppression of immunity should facilitate development of efficacious new vaccines targeting difficult-to-prevent infections.
@method distributed differential privacy and applications we propose a general purpose runtime framework to secure timing channels. our technique supports higher-order function invocations and computations looping on secret data, features which none of the existing approaches fully allow. we provably eliminate external and internal timing channels in both sequential and concurrent settings, in presence of deterministic as well as nondeterministic schedulers. there is a price to be paid, however – the high computation may have to be disrupted; the low computation is nevertheless guaranteed to be unaffected. we illustrate how our approach can be realized on standard computing platforms.
@method the impact of resistance training on swimming performance: a systematic review abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
@background extensive calc i f icat ions objective the aim of this study was to report the clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 143 benign fibro-osseous lesions (bfols).   study design clinical and radiologic information were retrieved from the patients files, and histologic features were reviewed from hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic slides.   results there were 22 ossifying fibromas (ofs), 21 fibrous dysplasias (fds) and 100 osseous dysplasias (ods; 65 florid, 18 focal, and 17 periapical). the mean age of the fd/of patients was a decade lower than those with od. the mandible was more affected than the maxilla, except in fds. all fds and ofs presented local swelling, whereas this was observed in <40% of the ods. radiologic images of the florid/periapical ods and ofs were predominantly mixed, whereas fds and focal ods were predominantly radiopaque.   conclusions florid od, of, and fd were the most common diagnoses, and the clinicopathologic and radiologic features were somewhat distinct from the characteristics of other populations.

@background study of trace elements in wet atmospheric precipitation in tehran, iran the horizontal distribution and levels of heavy metals in the biggest snowstorm in shenyang since 1904 were investigated by analyzing 4 metals (as, cd, pb, and cu) in a series of ultraclean samples collected from 17 sites distributed in different regions of the shenyang area, china. the results showed that the concentrations of all the 4 heavy metals in snow from the industrial regions were high, up to 7.3 (as), 2.2 (cd), 850.0 (pb), and 0.197-20.2 (cu) microg/kg, respectively. in the suburb, in contrast, their concentrations were not detected, except for as. because of the long-term application of arsenical pesticides and herbicides, as was detected in the snow samples which collected on the farm. as, cd, and pb were also detected in the snow samples collected from the parks, the residential areas, and the commercial districts mainly by reason of human activities. in a sense, long-term industrial activities, traffic activities, coal combustion, and agricultural activities affected the horizontal distribution and levels of these heavy metals in snow differently. the data relating to the horizontal distribution and concentrations of heavy metals in the snow under extreme climatic conditions can provide with a unique snapshot of environmental pollution situation and behaviors in urban areas.
@method pparδ agonists have opposing effects on insulin resistance in high fat‐fed rats and mice due to different metabolic responses in muscle in this study, we defined the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (ppardelta) in metabolic homeostasis by using subtype selective agonists. analysis of rat l6 myotubes treated with the ppardelta subtype-selective agonist, gw501516, by the affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays revealed that ppardelta controls fatty acid oxidation by regulating genes involved in fatty acid transport, beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial respiration. similar ppardelta-mediated gene activation was observed in the skeletal muscle of gw501516-treated mice. accordingly, gw501516 treatment induced fatty acid beta-oxidation in l6 myotubes as well as in mouse skeletal muscles. administration of gw501516 to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, an effect accompanied by enhanced metabolic rate and fatty acid beta-oxidation, proliferation of mitochondria, and a marked reduction of lipid droplets in skeletal muscles. despite a modest body weight change relative to vehicle-treated mice, gw501516 treatment also markedly improved diabetes as revealed by the decrease in plasma glucose and blood insulin levels in genetically obese ob/ob mice. these data suggest that ppardelta is pivotal to control the program for fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle, thereby ameliorating obesity and insulin resistance through its activation in obese animals.
@method multiple new site-specific recombinases for use in manipulating animal genomes a new member of the 2-micron family of plasmids, named ptd1, was found in the yeast torulaspora delbrueckii, a widespread yeast associated with food. nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of a pair of inverted repeats and three open reading frames, one of which is a homologue of the flp recombinase gene of 2-micron plasmid. an ars region was identified, by replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae and t. delbrueckii, near one of the inverted repeats. by the use of ptd1 derivatives and auxotrophic mutant hosts an efficient host-vector system was established for t. delbrueckii. so far, the 2-micron family of plasmids is restricted to four closely related genera (q6 group): saccharomyces, zygosaccharomyces, kluyveromyces, and torulaspora. after a survey of 2500 strains belonging to about 500 species (80 genera) of yeast, no circular plasmids were found in other genera.
@background association of response to hepatitis b vaccination and survival in dialysis patients cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non‐specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. in addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. this short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non‐structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. today, the term “cytokine” encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. as of this writing, 33 cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. there are certainly over 100 separate genes coding for cytokine‐like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. a recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being “autoimmune” or “autoinflammatory” thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.
@background inhibition of mtor sensitizes breast cancer stem cells to radiation-induced repression of self-renewal through the regulation of mnsod and akt ionizing radiation triggers diverse responses in human cells encompassing apoptosis, necrosis, stress-induced premature senescence (sips), autophagy, and endopolyploidy (e.g., multinucleation). most of these responses result in loss of colony-forming ability in the clonogenic survival assay. however, not all modes of so-called clonogenic cell “death” are necessarily advantageous for therapeutic outcome in cancer radiotherapy. for example, the crosstalk between sips and autophagy is considered to influence the capacity of the tumor cells to maintain a prolonged state of growth inhibition that unfortunately can be succeeded by tumor regrowth and disease recurrence. likewise, endopolyploid giant cells are able to segregate into near diploid descendants that continue mitotic activities. herein we review the current knowledge on the roles that the p53 and p21waf1 tumor suppressors play in determining the fate of human fibroblasts (normal and li-fraumeni syndrome) and solid tumor-derived cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. in addition, we discuss the important role of wip1, a p53-regulated oncogene, in the temporal regulation of the dna damage response and its contribution to p53 dynamics post-irradiation. this article highlights the complexity of the dna damage response and provides an impetus for rethinking the nature of cancer cell resistance to therapeutic agents.
@method molecular epidemiology of group b streptococcal meningitis in children beyond the neonatal period from angola. transmission of group b streptococcus (gbs) from mothers to neonates during childbirth is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. although subtyping tools have identified specific gbs phylogenetic lineages that are important in neonatal disease, little is known about the genetic diversity of these lineages or the roles that recombination and selection play in the generation of emergent genotypes. here, we examined genetic variation, selection, and recombination in seven multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci from 94 invasive, colonizing, and bovine strains representing 38 gbs sequence types and performed dna sequencing and pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of several putative virulence genes to identify gene content differences between genotypes. despite the low level of diversity in the mlst loci, a neighbor net analysis revealed a variable range of genetic exchange among the seven clonal complexes (ccs) identified, suggesting that recombination is partly responsible for the diversity observed between genotypes. recombination is also important for several virulence genes, as some gene alleles had evidence for lateral gene exchange across divergent genotypes. the cc-17 lineage, which is associated with neonatal disease, is relatively homogeneous and therefore appears to have diverged independently with an exclusive set of virulence characteristics. these data suggest that different gbs genetic backgrounds have distinct virulence gene profiles that may be important for disease pathogenesis. such profiles could be used as markers for the rapid detection of strains with an increased propensity to cause neonatal disease and may be considered useful vaccine targets.
@background 3d visualisation and quantification by microcomputed tomography of late gestational changes in the arterial and venous feto-placental vasculature of the mouse. the current understanding of the placental vascular tree largely derives from time-consuming morphometric analyses performed by conventional histology, electron microscopy of corrosion casts and three-dimensional reconstructions based on physical tissue sections. in the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that micro-computed tomography (micro-ct) emerges as a new, non-destructive and fast tool for imaging and quantifying fetoplacental vasculature. term placentae (n=5) were perfused with contrast agent consisting of barium-sulfate, gelatine and thymol shortly after caesarean-section-delivery. samples (1 cm(3)) from eight different regions of the placenta were subsequently scanned in a micro-ct. using tomographic reconstruction algorithms, three dimensional images were obtained by micro-ct allowing total stereoscopic visualization and continuous quantitative analysis of the vascular structure of the investigated samples. these samples were compared regarding vascular surface (vs) and vascular density (vascular volume fraction, tcvf). quantitative assessment showed an average vascular density of 16 per cent (sd+/-0.4) and a vascular surface of 475 mm(2)(sd+/-8) per total tissue volume (including intervillous space) of 125 mm(3). micro-ct image-analysis showed no significant differences in the fetal vascularization among term placentae. micro-ct imaging is feasible for imaging and analysis of the villous vascular tree, allows further morphologic studies and immunohistochemistry of the placental specimens and may emerge as an additional tool in the investigation of the physiology and pathophysiology of the placental vasculature.
@method structure learning in random fields for heart motion abnormality detection coronary heart disease can be diagnosed by measuring and scoring regional motion of the heart wall in ultrasound images of the left ventricle (lv) of the heart. we describe a completely automated and robust technique that detects diseased hearts based on detection and automatic tracking of the endocardium and epicardium of the lv. the local wall regions and the entire heart are then classified as normal or abnormal based on the regional and global lv wall motion. in order to leverage structural information about the heart we applied bayesian networks to this problem, and learned the relations among the wall regions off of the data using a structure learning algorithm. we checked the validity of the obtained structure using anatomical knowledge of the heart and medical rules as described by doctors. the resultant bayesian network classifier depends only on a small subset of numerical features extracted from dual-contours tracked through time and selected using a filter-based approach. our numerical results confirm that our system is robust and accurate on echocardiograms collected in routine clinical practice at one hospital; our system is built to be used in real-time.
@method identification of enriched driver gene alterations in subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer patients based on histology and smoking status to investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular features of the t790m mutation and c-met amplification in a cohort of chinese non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis). egfr tki-resistant nsclc patients (n = 29) and corresponding tumor specimens, and 53 samples of postoperative tki-naïve nsclc patients were collected. egfr exon 19, 20, and 21 mutations were analyzed. and c-met gene copy number was determined. the egfr t790m mutation in exon 20 was not detected in the population of 53 tki-naïve patients, but found in 48.3% (14/29) of the enrolled tki-resistant patients. c-met was amplified in 3.8% (2/53) of the tki-naïve nsclc patients and highly amplified in 17.2% (5/29) of the cohort. most of t790m mutations were frequently associated with non-smoker, adenocarcinoma and egfr activating mutations. three male patients with t790m mutation occurred with wild-type egfr, and were resistant to the treatments following tki resistance. features of c-met amplification in tki-naïve patients were indistinguishable from tki-resistant patients. in the group of wild-type egfr, patients with t790m mutation had median progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) as 9.6 months and 12.6 months, respectively; whereas the median pfs and os of c-met amplified patients was 4.1 months and 8.0 months, respectively. these results suggest that egfr t790m mutation and c-met amplification can occur in tki-resistant nsclc with wild-type egfr, and these genetic defects might be related to different survival outcome. c-met amplification in tki-naïve or -resistant patients might share similarities in clinicopathologic features.
@method high-frequency electrical stimulation of the human skin induces heterotopical mechanical hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia, and enhanced responses to nonnociceptive vibrotactile input. knowing whether an individual prefers the left or right hand for skilled activities is important to researchers in experimental psychology and neuroscience. the current study reports on a new measure of skilled hand preference derived from the provins and cunliffe (1972) handedness inventory. undergraduates (n = 3324) indicated their lateral preference for their hands, feet, eyes and ears. a measure of hand performance and familial handedness was also obtained. factor analysis identified ten items that loaded on skilled hand preference and these were included in the new flanders questionnaire. cluster analysis of the new questionnaire revealed three distinct groups (left-, mixed- & right-handed). the new test showed a strong association with other measures of lateral preference and hand performance. scores on the test were also related to the sex of the respondent and the hand preference of their parents. the flanders provides a measure of skilled hand preference that is easy to administer and understand and should be useful for experimenters wanting to screen for hand preference.
@background nanog-induced dedifferentiation of p53-deficient mouse astrocytes into brain cancer stem-like cells. somatic cell nuclear transfer allows trans-acting factors present in the mammalian oocyte to reprogram somatic cell nuclei to an undifferentiated state. we show that four factors (oct4, sox2, nanog, and lin28) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (es) cells. these induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human es cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.
@background expression of lactate dehydrogenase-a and -b messenger ribonucleic acids in chick glycogen body. representatives of 30 species of fish were examined for their content of ldh isozymes. one major isozyme system was found in all fish. in addition, two minor systems restricted to eyes and to gonads were found in many fish. fish may be classified into four groups on the basis of their possession of one, two, three, or five major isozymes of ldh. the major isozyme patterns can be attributed to the polymers of two protein subunits under the control of two genes, as in mammals and birds, but the variety of heteropolymers produced varies in different species. the fluke and other flatfish are exceptional in that they synthesize only one kind of subunit which polymerizes to form a single variety of ldh. all other fish produced at least two major isozymes presumably the homopolymers of a and b subunits. the three-isozyme fish produce, in addition, a single heteropolymer. a few fish produce three heteropolymers and two homopolymers to produce the characteristic pattern of five isozymes seen in mammals.    in populations of the whiting, which has five major isozymes, two mutant alleles at the b locus were discovered. each of these alleles produced polypeptides with characteristic electrophoretic mobilities. consequently, heterozygous individuals contained more than 15 isozymes.    a variety of minor isozymes that appear on zymograms may represent modifications of the major isozymes. however, the minor isozyme systems of the gonad and the eye seem to be genetically distinct molecular systems, separate from and in addition to the major isozyme system.
@method cell-level temperature distributions in skeletal muscle post spinal cord injury as related to deep tissue injury resistance to blood flow through peripheral vascular beds strongly influences cardiovascular function and transport to tissue. for a given vascular architecture, flow resistance is determined by the rheological behavior of blood flowing through microvessels. a new approach for calculating the contribution of blood rheology to microvascular flow resistance is presented. morphology (diameter and length), flow velocity, hematocrit, and topological position were determined for all vessel segments (up to 913) of terminal microcirculatory networks in the rat mesentery by intravital microscopy. flow velocity and hematocrit were also predicted from mathematical flow simulations, in which the assumed dependence of flow resistance on diameter, hematocrit, and shear rate was optimized to minimize the deviation between measured and predicted values. for microvessels with diameters below approximately 40 microns, the resulting flow resistances are markedly higher and show a stronger dependence on hematocrit than previously estimated from measurements of blood flow in narrow glass tubes. for example, flow resistance in 10-microns microvessels at normal hematocrit is found to exceed that of a corresponding glass tube by a factor of approximately 4. in separate experiments, flow resistance of microvascular networks was estimated from direct measurements of total pressure drop and volume flow, at systemic hematocrits intentionally varied from 0.08 to 0.68. the results agree closely with predictions based on the above-optimized resistance but not with predictions based on glass-tube data. the unexpectedly high flow resistance in small microvessels may be related to interactions between blood components and the inner vessel surface that do not occur in smooth-walled tubes.
@result risk factors for prostate cancer detection after a negative biopsy: a novel multivariable longitudinal approach. objectives to assess the current incidence of prostate carcinoma detection in serial biopsies in a prostate-specific antigen-based screening population after a diagnosis of isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hg-pin) in needle biopsy tissue.   methods we retrospectively identified 190 men with a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in needle biopsy tissue. most men (86%) were diagnosed from 1996 to 2000. logistic regression analysis was used to predict the presence of carcinoma in these 190 men and in a control group of 1677 men with only benign prostatic tissue in needle biopsy tissue.   results the cumulative risk of detection of carcinoma on serial sextant follow-up biopsies was 30.5% for those with isolated hg-pin compared with 26.2% for the control group (p = 0.2). patient age (p = 0.03) and serum prostate-specific antigen level (p = 0.02) were significantly linked to the risk of cancer detection, but suspicious digital rectal examination findings (p = 0.1), the presence of hg-pin (p = 0.2), and the histologic attributes of pin were not (all with nonsignificant p values). hg-pin found on the first repeat biopsy was associated with a 41% risk of subsequent detection of carcinoma compared with an 18% risk if benign prostatic tissue was found on the first repeat biopsy (p = 0.01).   conclusions the results of our study have shown that the current level of risk for the detection of prostate carcinoma in a screened population is 30.5% after a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in a needle biopsy. this risk level is lower than the previously reported risk of 33% to 50%. hg-pin is a risk factor for carcinoma detection only when found on consecutive sextant biopsies. the data presented here should prompt reconsideration of repeat biopsy strategies for hg-pin, and re-evaluation of the absolute necessity of repeat biopsy for all patients with hg-pin.
@method interactions of exercise training and alpha-lipoic acid on insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of obese zucker rats. voluntary wheel running (wr) by juvenile female rats was used as a noninterventional model of soleus muscle functional overload to study the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity by the glucose transporter (glut-4 isoform) protein level and glycogen concentration. soleus total protein content was significantly greater (+18%; p < 0.05) than in age-matched controls after 1 wk of wr, and this hypertrophic response continued in weeks 2-4 (+24-32%). glut-4 protein was 39% greater than in controls in 1-wk wr soleus, and this adaptation was accompanied by a similar increase in in vitro insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity (+29%). after 2 and 4 wk of wr, however, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity had returned to control levels, despite a continued elevation (+25-28%) of glut-4 protein. at these two time points, glycogen concentration was significantly enhanced in wr soleus (+21-42%), which coincided with significant reductions in glycogen synthase activity ratios (-23 to -41%). these results indicate that, in this model of soleus muscle functional overload, the glut-4 protein level may initially regulate insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in the absence of changes in other modifying factors. however, this regulation of glucose transport activity by glut-4 protein may be subsequently overridden by elevated glycogen concentration.
@method functional roles played by the sympathetic supply to lip blood vessels in the cat. 1 the present study was designed to examine the interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on blood flow in oro‐facial areas such as lower lip, palate and submandibular gland (smg) and in the common carotid artery (cca) in anaesthetized cats. 2 section of the ipsilateral superior cervical sympathetic trunk (cst) increased the basal cca blood flow significantly. the control level with the nerve intact was comparable with that seen at 0.5‐1 hz cst stimulation, suggesting a spontaneous discharge of around 0.5‐1 hz in the cst fibres innervating the beds supplied by the cca. the basal blood flow at all sites examined was reduced by cst stimulation in a frequency‐dependent manner. 3 electrical stimulation of the central end of the lingual nerve (ln) evoked blood flow increases in the lower lip and palate. these blood flow increases were markedly reduced by concurrent cst stimulation in a manner that was frequency dependent, but not simply related to the vasoconstrictor effect of cst stimulation. this effect of cst stimulation was not observed in tongue or smg, even though cst stimulation evoked vasoconstriction in these tissues. a significant reduction in the level of cca blood flow attained during ln stimulation was observed on repetitive cst stimulation only at 10 hz, indicating that this response behaved in a fashion different from that seen in the lower lip, palate, tongue and smg. 4 the present study suggests that concurrent repetitive cst stimulation reduces parasympathetically mediated blood flow increases in certain oro‐facial areas (such as the lower lip and palate), but not in the tongue and smg. this inhibitory action was not a simple additive effect (between vasoconstriction and vasodilatation) and it disappeared rapidly after the cessation of cst stimulation.
@result evaluation of argos telemetry accuracy in the high-arctic and implications for the estimation of home-range size study of animal movements is key for understanding their ecology and facilitating their conservation. the argos satellite system is a valuable tool for tracking species which move long distances, inhabit remote areas, and are otherwise difficult to track with traditional vhf telemetry and are not suitable for gps systems. previous research has raised doubts about the magnitude of position errors quoted by the satellite service provider cls. in addition, no peer-reviewed publications have evaluated the usefulness of the cls supplied error ellipses nor the accuracy of the new kalman filtering (kf) processing method. using transmitters hung from towers and trees in southeastern peru, we show the argos error ellipses generally contain <25% of the true locations and therefore do not adequately describe the true location errors. we also find that kf processing does not significantly increase location accuracy. the errors for both ls and kf processing methods were found to be lognormally distributed, which has important repercussions for error calculation, statistical analysis, and data interpretation. in brief, “good” positions (location codes 3, 2, 1, a) are accurate to about 2 km, while 0 and b locations are accurate to about 5–10 km. however, due to the lognormal distribution of the errors, larger outliers are to be expected in all location codes and need to be accounted for in the user’s data processing. we evaluate five different empirical error estimates and find that 68% lognormal error ellipses provided the most useful error estimates. longitude errors are larger than latitude errors by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting the use of elliptical error ellipses. numerous studies over the past 15 years have also found fault with the cls-claimed error estimates yet cls has failed to correct their misleading information. we hope this will be reversed in the near future.
@result talin, vinculin and nestin expression in orofacial muscles of dystrophin deficient mdx mice we describe the expression and distribution patterns of nestin, desmin and vimentin in intact and regenerating muscle spindles of the rat hind limb skeletal muscles. regeneration was induced by intramuscular isotransplantation of extensor digitorum longus (edl) or soleus muscles from 15-day-old rats into the edl muscle of adult female inbred lewis rats. the host muscles with grafts were excised after 7-, 16-, 21- and 29-day survival and immunohistochemically stained. nestin expression in intact spindles in host muscles was restricted to schwann cells of sensory and motor nerves. in transplanted muscles, however, nestin expression was also found in regenerating “spindle fibers”, 7 and 16 days after grafting. from the 21st day onwards, the regenerated spindle fibers were devoid of nestin immunoreactivity. desmin was detected in spindle fibers at all developmental stages in regenerating as well as in intact spindles. vimentin was expressed in cells of the outer and inner capsules of all muscle spindles and in newly formed myoblasts and myotubes of regenerating spindles 7 days after grafting. our results show that the expression pattern of these intermediate filaments in regenerating spindle fibers corresponds to that found in regenerating extrafusal fibers, which supports our earlier suggestion that they resemble small-diameter extrafusal fibers.
@result peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness profile determined with high speed, ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography high-density scanning. aimsto establish four normal retinal nerve fibre layer (rnfl) thickness radial profiles based on third-generation optical coherence tomography (oct) and to compare them with previously reported histologic measurements.methodsa total of 20 normal eyes were studied. a circular scan was adjusted to the size of the optic disc and three scans were performed with this radius and every 200 μm thereafter, up to a distance of 1400 μm. four different radial sections (superotemporal, superonasal, inferonasal, and inferotemporal) were studied to establish rnfl thickness oct profiles. additionally, two radial scans orientated at 45 and 135° crossing the optic disc centre were performed in six of 20 eyes, and rnfl thickness was measured at disc margin.resultsquadrant location and distance from disc margin interaction in rnfl thickness was statistically significant (p<0.001). the rnfl thickness decreased (p<0.001) as the distance from the disc margin increased for all sections. the measurements automatically generated by the oct built-in software were thinner (p<0.001) than histologic ones close to the disc margin.conclusionsfour normal oct rnfl profiles were established and compared with histological data obtained from the same area. rnfl measurements assessed by oct 3 were significantly thinner close to the optic disc margin.
@background knowledge, practices, and perceived barriers regarding cancer pain management among physicians and nurses in korea: a nationwide multicenter survey traditional education methods for physicians have failed to impact positively upon cancer pain clinical practice. this article presents a new paradigm for physician cancer pain education based on principles of adult learning and physician behavior theory. three key issues that weave together education and institutionalization issues are reviewed: (a) how to make physicians aware that their current practice behavior is less than optimal; (b) how to match education objectives with appropriate education formats; and (c) how to change pain management practices without imposing new burdens on physician practice.
@method characterization of the antidiabetic role of parkinsonia aculeata (caesalpineaceae) hypoglycemic effect of gentiana olivieri griseb. (gentianaceae) flowering herbs on oral administration were studied using in vivo models in normal, glucose-hyperglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. through in vivo bioassay-guided fractionation processes isoorientin, a known c-glycosylflavone, was isolated from the ethylacetate fraction by silica gel column chromatography as the main active ingredient from the plant. isoorientin exhibited significant hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects at 15 mg/kg b.w.dose. isoorientin concentration of the extracts and fractions were determined by hplc in order to establish a correlation between the hypoglycaemic activity.
@method influence of the virus lbfv and of wolbachia in a host-parasitoid interaction wolbachia are a group of intracellular inherited bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods. they are associated with a number of different reproductive phenotypes in their hosts, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. while it is known that the bacterial strains responsible for these different host phenotypes form a single clade within the α–proteobacteria, until now it has not been possible to resolve the evolutionary relationships between differentwolbachia strains. to address this issue we have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding a surface protein ofwolbachia (wsp) from a representative sample of 28wolbachia strains. the sequences from this gene were highly variable and could be used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of differentwolbachia strains. based on the sequence of thewsp gene from differentwolbachia isolates we propose that thewolbachia pipientis clade be initially divided into 12 groups. as more sequence information becomes available we expect the number of such groups to increase. in addition, we present a method ofwolbachia classification based on the use of group–specificwsp pcr primers which will allowwolbachia isolates to be typed without the need to clone and sequence individualwolbachia genes. this system should facilitate future studies investigating the distribution and biology ofwolbachia strains from large samples of different host species.
@method endogenous gip ameliorates impairment of insulin secretion in proglucagon-deficient mice under moderate beta cell damage induced by streptozotocin aims/introduction:  excessive intake of sucrose can cause severe health issues, such as diabetes mellitus. in animal studies, consumption of a high‐sucrose diet (suc) has been shown to cause obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. however, several in vivo experiments have been carried out using diets with much higher sucrose contents (50–70% of the total calories) than are typically ingested by humans. in the present study, we examined the effects of a moderate suc on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanism.
@method activity of primate orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal neurons: task-related activity during an oculomotor delayed-response task 1. single-neuron activity was recorded from the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing saccadic eye movements in oculomotor delayed-response (odr) and visually guided saccade (vgs) tasks. in the odr task the monkey was required to maintain fixation of a central spot throughout the 0.5-s cue and 3.0-s delay before making a saccadic eye movement in the dark to one of four or eight locations where the visual cue had been presented. the same locations were used for targets in the vgs tasks; however, unlike the odr task, saccades in the vgs tasks were visually guided. 2. among 434 neurons recorded from prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (ps), 147 changed their discharge rates in relation to saccadic eye movements in the odr task. their response latencies relative to saccade initiation were distributed between -192 and 460-ms, with 22% exhibiting presaccadic activity and 78% exhibiting only postsaccadic activity. among ps neurons with presaccadic activity, 53% also had postsaccadic activity when the monkey made saccadic eye movements opposite to the directions for which the presaccadic activity was observed. 3. almost all (97%) ps neurons with presaccadic activity were directionally selective. the best direction and tuning specificity of each neuron were estimated from parameters used to fit a gaussian tuning curve function. the best direction for 62% of the neurons with presaccadic activity was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (23%) or along the vertical meridian (15%). 4. most postsaccadic activity of ps neurons (92%) was also directionally selective. the best direction for 48% of these neurons was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (36%) or along the vertical meridian (16%). eighteen percent of the neurons with postsaccadic activity showed a reciprocal response pattern: excitatory responses occurred for one set of saccade directions, whereas inhibitory responses occurred for roughly the opposite set of directions. 5. sixty ps neurons with saccade-related activity in the odr task were also examined in a vgs task. forty of these neurons showed highly similar profiles of directional specificity and response magnitude in both tasks, 13 showed saccade-related activity only in the odr task, and 7 changed their response characteristics between the odr and vgs tasks.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

@method time-lapse imaging of the dynamics of cns glial-axonal interactions in vitro and ex vivo abstract: the gene expression of myelin basic proteins (mbps) in shiverer mutant mice was investigated by the northern and southern hybridization techniques. in the control mice rna molecules from the brains which were about 2,300 nucleotides in length were hybridized to cdna of 1.8 kb encoding for a mouse mbp, but rna from the brains of 3‐week‐old shiverer mutant mice contained no detectable amount of mbp transcripts hybridizing to this probe. moreover the shiverer mutant mice lost several restriction fragments that hybridized to the same probe in the control mice when each of the five restriction enzymes, i.e., hindiii, psti, pvuii, acci, and stui, was used. these data suggest that the shiverer mutation may correspond to the deletion of a large portion of mbp exon(s) in the gene, and this deletion causes inefficient transcription leading to the depletion of mbps in the myelin and the dysmyelination observed in these mice.

@background whole blood transcriptional profiling reveals deregulation of oxidative and antioxidative defence genes in myelofibrosis and related neoplasms. potential implications of downregulation of nrf2 for genomic instability and disease progression it is widely accepted that the p53 tumor suppressor restricts abnormal cells by induction of growth arrest or by triggering apoptosis. here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ros), a major cause of dna damage and genetic instability. in the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ros. downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of dna, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (nac). dietary supplementation with nac prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.
@background does tsh trigger the anti-thyroid autoimmune processes? observation on a large cohort of naive patients with thyroid hemiagenesis fewer than 10 families have been reported with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh), which has been described as the ‘‘congestive cardiomyopathy-hypertrophic hypogonadism syndrome,’’ and may include mental retardation, broad nasal base, collagenoma, blepharoptosis, arachnodactyly, kyphoscoliosis,deafness, blindness, and minor bone abnormalities [najjar et al., 1973, 1984; sacks et al., 1980; malouf et al., 1985; warren et al., 1987; narahara et al., 1992]. because the phenotype is variable, genetic heterogeneity is likely. we report a new family with three siblings, in whom the proband also had thyroid hemiagenesis. the propositus is a 19-year-old male of turkish ancestry with dcm-hh born to unrelated parents. two older sisters had dcm confirmed by echocardiography, one of whom died as a result of dcm at 13 years of age. an autopsy was not permitted by family. an affected living sister is currently under consideration for cardiac transplantation. she also has hypertrophic hypogonadism with a normal thyroid by ultrasonography and no additional features of dcm-hh. the patient’s parents and youngest (third) sister were clinically and echocardiographically normal. at age 14 years, the propositus had been admitted to hospital for evaluation of heart failure due to dcm diagnosed in early childhood, complicated by ventricular tachycardia and recurrent cardiac decompensation. orthotopic heart transplantation was performed 12 months after initial admission, and he did well after the operation. at age 18 years, he had an endocrine consultation to evaluate delayed secondary sexual characteristics which included a eunuchoid appearance, absent facial hair and scant axillary and pubic hair, microphallus (stretched penile length 4 cm), and prepubertal testicular size (1 ml using prader orchidometer). there were no palpable masses in either testicle. the right lobe of the thyroid gland was easily palpable, but the left lobe was nonpalpable. hormonal assessment supported the diagnosis of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism with serum total testosterone 220 ng/dl (normal range, 280– 880 ng/dl), serum-free testosterone 7.35 ng/ml (normal range, 10–42 ng/ml), luteinizing hormone 22.8 miu/ml (normal range, 1.7–8.6 miu/ml), and follicle-stimulating hormone 49.7 miu/ml (normal range, 0.7–11.4 miu/ml). he was treated with intramuscular testosterone at a dose of 250 mg every 3 weeks. after 3 months, the serum level of folliclestimulating hormone normalized (7.6 miu/ml) and the serum-free testosterone level was 22.6 ng/ml. in the following months, the patient showed progressive muscular development, voice deepening, facial and body hair, penis growth to 8 cm, and increased testicular volume. thyroid function tests at initial endocrine consultation were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy (sodium 99m tc pertechnetate) showed absence of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and isthmus. twenty-five to thirty percent of the cases of dcm are familial which can be transmitted as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or as a matrilineal (mitochondrial) trait [seidman and seidman, 2001]. table i summarizes the clinical data on the ‘‘syndrome’’ of dcm combined with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh) and other
@method compliance with noninvasive home ventilation in children with obstructive sleep apnoea. positive airway pressure (pap) devices are used to treat patients with sleep related breathing disorders (srbds), including obstructive sleep apnea (osa). after a patient is diagnosed with osa, the current standard of practice involves performing attended polysomnography (psg), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) and bilevel positive airway pressure (bpap) represent the two forms of pap that are manually titrated during psg to determine the single fixed pressure of cpap or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (ipap and epap, respectively) of bpap for subsequent nightly usage. a pap titration task force of the american academy of sleep medicine reviewed the available literature. based on this review, the task force developed these recommendations for conducting cpap and bpap titrations. major recommendations are as follows: (1) all potential pap titration candidates should receive adequate pap education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration. (2) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated (no specific order) or the recommended maximum cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (reras), and snoring. (3) the recommended minimum starting cpap should be 4 cm h2o for pediatric and adult patients, and the recommended minimum starting ipap and epap should be 8 cm h2o and 4 cm h2o, respectively, for pediatric and adult patients on bpap. (4) the recommended maximum cpap should be 15 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 20 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients < 12 years, and 20 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 30 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients > or = 12 years. (5) the recommended minimum ipap-epap differential is 4 cm h2o and the recommended maximum ipap-epap differential is 10 cm h2o (6) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap depending on the type of event) should be increased by at least 1 cm h2o with an interval no shorter than 5 min, with the goal of eliminating obstructive respiratory events. (7) cpap (ipap and epap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 obstructive apnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 2 obstructive apneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (8) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 hypopnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 hypopneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (9) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 3 reras are observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 5 reras are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (10) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) may be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 min of loud or unambiguous snoring is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 min of loud or unambiguous snoring are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (11) the titration algorithm for split-night cpap or bpap titration studies should be identical to that of full-night cpap or bpap titration studies, respectively. (12) if the patient is uncomfortable or intolerant of high pressures on cpap, the patient may be tried on bpap. if there are continued obstructive respiratory events at 15 cm h2o of cpap during the titration study, the patient may be switched to bpap. (13) the pressure of cpap or bpap selected for patient use following the titration study should reflect control of the patient's obstructive respiration by a low (preferably < 5 per hour) respiratory disturbance index (rdi) at the selected pressure, a minimum sea level spo2 above 90% at the pressure, and with a leak within acceptable parameters at the pressure.) (14) an optimal titration reduces rdi < 5 for at least a 15-min duration and should include supine rem sleep at the selected pressure that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings. (15) a good titration reduces rdi < or = 10 or by 50% if the baseline rdi < 15 and should include supine rem sleep that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings at the selected pressure. (16) an adequate titration does not reduce the rdi < or = 10 but reduces the rdi by 75% from baseline (especially in severe osa patients), or one in which the titration grading criteria for optimal or good are met with the exception that supine rem sleep did not occur at the selected pressure. (17) an unacceptable titration is one that does not meet any one of the above grades. (18) a repeat pap titration study should be considered if the initial titration does not achieve a grade of optimal or good and, if it is a split-night psg study, it fails to meet aasm criteria (i.e., titration duration should be > 3 hr).
@background abstract stimulus-specific adaptation models neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
@background structural insights into adeno-associated virus serotype 5 abstract adeno-associated viruses (aavs) are being developed as gene therapy vectors, and their efficacy could be improved by a detailed understanding of their viral capsid structures. aav serotype 8 (aav8) shows a significantly greater liver transduction efficiency than those of other serotypes, which has resulted in efforts to develop this virus as a gene therapy vector for hemophilia a and familial hypercholesterolemia. pseudotyping studies show that the differential tissue tropism and transduction efficiencies exhibited by the aavs result from differences in their capsid viral protein (vp) amino acids. towards identifying the structural features underpinning these disparities, we report the crystal structure of the aav8 viral capsid determined to 2.6-å resolution. the overall topology of its common overlapping vp is similar to that previously reported for the crystal structures of aav2 and aav4, with an eight-stranded β-barrel and long loops between the β-strands. the most significant structural differences between aav8 and aav2 (the best-characterized serotype) are located on the capsid surface at protrusions surrounding the two-, three-, and fivefold axes at residues reported to control transduction efficiency and antibody recognition for aav2. in addition, a comparison of the aav8 and aav2 capsid surface amino acids showed a reduced distribution of basic charge for aav8 at the mapped aav2 heparin sulfate receptor binding region, consistent with an observed non-heparin-binding phenotype for aav8. thus, this aav8 structure provides an additional platform for mutagenesis efforts to characterize aav capsid regions responsible for differential cellular tropism, transduction, and antigenicity for these promising gene therapy vectors.

@background alzheimer's phenotypes induced by overexpression of human presenilin 2 mutant proteins stimulate significant changes in key factors of glucose metabolism. cerebellar granule cells grown in the presence of a serum complex differentiate but are resistant to the lethal action of excitatory amino acids. when these cells are grown also in the presence of insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) they become fully susceptible to the toxic, lethal action of glutamate. the glutamate-sensitizing action of igf-i is dependent on concentration (half-maximal effect at 2-4 ng/ml) and time (half-maximal effect at 2-4 days in vitro) and is paralleled by the appearance of functionally active, glutamate-activated, ca2+ channels and of voltage-gated na+ and late k+ channels. igf-i-induced glutamate sensitivity is rapidly reversible (t1/2 = 30-60 min) after removal of this somatomedin. the action of igf-i is not mimicked by igf-ii, nerve growth factor, basic or acidic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or tumor necrosis factor alpha. we postulate that the constitutive phenotype of cerebellar granule cells is glutamate-resistant and becomes responsive to excitatory amino acids under the action of epigenetic cues among which igf-i may be one of those operative in vivo.
@method learning dilation factors for semantic segmentation of street scenes convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. we show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. we define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. we adapt contemporary classification networks (alexnet, the vgg net, and googlenet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. we then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of pascal voc (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean iu on 2012), nyudv2, sift flow, and pascal-context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.
@result mechanism of substrate recognition and plp-induced conformational changes in ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase from arabidopsis thaliana. three-dimensional structures are reported for a mutant (betak87t) tryptophan synthase alpha2beta2 complex with either the substrate l-serine (betak87t-ser) or product l-tryptophan (betak87t-trp) at the active site of the beta-subunit, in which both amino acids form external aldimines with the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. we also present structures with l-serine bound to the beta site and either alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate (betak87t-ser-gp) or indole-3-propanol phosphate (betak87t-ser-ipp) bound to the active site of the alpha-subunit. the results further identify the substrate and product binding sites in each subunit and provide insight into conformational changes that occur upon formation of these complexes. the two structures having ligands at the active sites of both alpha- and beta-subunits reveal an important new feature, the ordering of alpha-subunit loop 6 (residues 179-187). closure of loop 6 isolates the active site of the alpha-subunit from solvent and results in interaction between alphathr183 and the catalytic residue alphaasp60. other conformational differences between the wild type and these two mutant structures include a rigid-body rotation of the alpha-subunit of approximately 5 degrees relative to the beta-subunit and large movements of part of the beta-subunit (residues 93-189) toward the rest of the beta-subunit. much smaller differences are observed in the betak87t-ser structure. remarkably, binding of tryptophan to the beta active site results in conformational changes very similar to those observed in the betak87t-ser-gp and betak87t-ser-ipp structures, with exception of the disordered alpha-subunit loop 6. these large-scale changes, the closure of loop 6, and the movements of a small number of side chains in the alpha-beta interaction site provide a structural base for interpreting the allosteric properties of tryptophan synthase.
@method virtual electrophysiological study of atrial fibrillation in fibrotic remodeling personalized computational cardiac models are emerging as an important tool for studying cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, and have the potential to become powerful instruments for guiding clinical anti-arrhythmia therapy. in this article, we present the methodology for constructing a patient-specific model of atrial fibrosis as a substrate for atrial fibrillation. the model is constructed from high-resolution late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (lge-mri) images acquired in vivo from a patient suffering from persistent atrial fibrillation, accurately capturing both the patient's atrial geometry and the distribution of the fibrotic regions in the atria. atrial fiber orientation is estimated using a novel image-based method, and fibrosis is represented in the patient-specific fibrotic regions as incorporating collagenous septa, gap junction remodeling, and myofibroblast proliferation. a proof-of-concept simulation result of reentrant circuits underlying atrial fibrillation in the model of the patient's fibrotic atrium is presented to demonstrate the completion of methodology development.
@method hydrogen isotope fractionation during water uptake by woody xerophytes summarycrops sprinkled with saline irrigation water are subject to foliar salt absorption and injury as well as to injury from soil salinity. yield reductions caused by soil salinity alone are well documented, and data are presented here for 71 agricultural crops. factors affecting these data and their applicability to sprinkler-irrigated crops are discussed. although foliar injury has been observed with many sprinkled crops, particularly tree crops, essentially no information is available to predict yield losses as a function of the salt concentration of the irrigation water. salinity thresholds for sprinkling-induced foliar injury are estimated for some crops; however, climatic conditions greatly affect the onset and degree of injury. managment strategies that minimize sprinkling injury are mentioned.
@method selected genetic polymorphisms and plasma coagulation factor vii changes with exercise training. objective to cross-sectionally evaluate the presence of clustering of the insulin-resistance syndrome components. tests were conducted for association of the hind iii restriction site polymorphism at the lipoprotein lipase locus with clustering of the physiological components of the insulin resistance syndrome. research design and methods dna samples of 370 normoglycemic hispanics and 520 normoglycemic non-hispanic whites from the san luis valley, colorado, were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. lipids and glucose were determined by the standard procedures. cross-tabulation and χ2 analysis were used. results the insulin-resistance syndrome components (elevated fasting insulin, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides) appeared together in individuals of this population sample more often than expected by chance. individuals in the population with the (+/+) lipoprotein lipase-hindiii restriction of fragment-length polymorphism genotype were more likely to have elevated fasting insulin and triglycerides and a reduced high-density lipoproteincholesterol level than subjects with the (+/−) genotype (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.38–3.98). conclusions as expected from the physiological function of lipoprotein lipase, the primary association of lipoprotein lipase genotypes is with triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. this appears to be the first reported genetic association with the insulin-resistance syndrome and may reflect genotype specific differences in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase by insulin.
@method a novel splice site mutation of the ldl receptor gene in a tunisian hypercholesterolemic family. the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma ldl, thereby providing cholesterol to cells. mutations disrupting the function of this receptor produce autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). affected individuals have elevated plasma levels of ldl, which causes premature coronary atherosclerosis. to date, 71 mutations in the ldl receptor gene have been characterized at a molecular level. in this report, we describe 79 additional mutations and review the insights that all 150 mutations have provided into the structure/function relationship of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of fh. © 1992 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background serum uric acid predicts vascular complications in adults with type 1 diabetes: the coronary artery calcification in type 1 diabetes study background immunoglobulin-a nephropathy (igan) is the most common chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide. many clinical and histopathological risk factors for progression have been found previously. recently, metabolic risk factors, such as hyperuricaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, also have been associated with the progression of igan.   methods in the present study we correlated clinical and metabolic risk factors with histopathological parameters in 202 patients with igan. morphological changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular tissue were semiquantitatively graded into three classes. mesangial proliferation activity and the amount of inflammatory cells were also evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of ki-67 (mib-1), cd45 (lca) and cd68 stainings. serum uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol, urine protein excretion (upe), blood pressure and body mass index (bmi) were measured. smoking habits and occurrence of diabetes mellitus also were evaluated. the independent role of serum uric acid in the development of renal morphological changes was evaluated in multivariate analysis.   results serum uric acid and upe level correlated with several histological parameters. uric acid level showed the strongest correlation with tubulointerstitial changes and upe with glomerulosclerosis. the level of serum triglycerides correlated with interstitial fibrosis and hyaline arteriolosclerosis. blood pressure correlated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial changes. bmi and diabetes mellitus correlated with both tubulointerstitial and vascular changes. we found no significant correlations between histopathological parameters and smoking habits or serum cholesterol level. serum uric acid had independent associations with the presence of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and inflammation.   conclusions we conclude that many metabolic factors are univariately associated with renal morphological findings in igan. these same factors are central in the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome and may have a pathogenetic role in the progression of igan. serum uric acid may have an independent role in development of tubulointerstitial lesions as well as being associated with inflammation in renal tissue of patients with igan.

@method ultracentrifugation deforms unfixed influenza a virions. abstract the viral replication cycle concludes with the assembly of viral components to form progeny virions. for influenza a viruses, the matrix m1 protein and two membrane integral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, function cooperatively in this process. here, we asked whether another membrane protein, the m2 protein, plays a role in virus assembly. the m2 protein, comprising 97 amino acids, possesses the longest cytoplasmic tail (54 residues) of the three transmembrane proteins of influenza a viruses. we therefore generated a series of deletion mutants of the m2 cytoplasmic tail by reverse genetics. we found that mutants in which more than 22 amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the m2 tail were viable but grew less efficiently than did the wild-type virus. an analysis of the virions suggested that viruses with m2 tail deletions of more than 22 carboxy-terminal residues apparently contained less viral ribonucleoprotein complex than did the wild-type virus. these m2 tail mutants also differ from the wild-type virus in their morphology: while the wild-type virus is spherical, some of the mutants were filamentous. alanine-scanning experiments further indicated that amino acids at positions 74 to 79 of the m2 tail play a role in virion morphogenesis and affect viral infectivity. we conclude that the m2 cytoplasmic domain of influenza a viruses plays an important role in viral assembly and morphogenesis.
@background genetic and environmental correlations between body mass index and waist circumference in china: the qingdao adolescent twin study with the changing patterns of morbidity and mortality in china, noncommunicable chronic diseases have become the major threats to the health of the chinese population. the causes of chronic diseases include genetic factors and behavioral risk factors such as the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and lack of physical activity. twin studies offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the genetic and environmental risk and protective factors for chronic disease. the qingdao twin registry (qtr) was initiated in 1998 as part of the national chinese twin registry. over 11,000 pairs of twins and multiples of all ages have been recruited into the registry. several studies of physical and mental health are underway. many of the adult twins have completed health and behavioral risk factor surveys, and the adolescent twins are participating in a study of gene-environment interactions in tobacco and alcohol use. studies of the heritability of personality factors have been conducted. in 2002, qingdao established the qingdao twin health promotion association, a nonprofit organization that supports health services for twins and their parents, organizes special events and health-related activities for twins, and raises funds to conduct twin health examinations. the qtr will be a useful resource for future studies of population genetics in human health and disease.
@method direct evidence for embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients in two pipefishes (syngnathidae: syngnathus spp.) summary male seahorses and pipefishes of the family syngnathidae are heralded for their unique brood pouch structures for incubating embryos. there are three general types of brood pouch with increasing complexity: simple ventral gluing, two pouch flaps and a completely sealed sac. the diversity of functional roles within a type in providing nutrition, aeration and protection to offspring is unknown. here we reveal significant differences in parental nutrient allocation to embryos for two closely related, sympatric pipefishes with similar brood pouch structure. we document differences in embryo attachment, depletion of pouch fluid nutrients over development and egg nutrient partitioning between syngnathus floridae and syngnathus fuscus. in s. fuscus, females produce nutritionally poor eggs and the males implant developing embryos in the brood pouch adjacent to blood vessels. a female-biased breeding population was observed, supporting the hypothesis that the cost of male parental care is high in this species. the loose connection between eggs and brood pouch tissues and the appearance of undeveloped eggs and lipid droplets in the pouch of s. floridae males suggest this species utilizes nutrient-rich eggs produced by females as nurse eggs to supplement embryonic development. a balanced sex-ratio for s. floridae further supports more equal parental contribution. this comparison provides evidence of a decline in female gametic investment and reveals the rapid diversification of syngnathid brood pouch function. our results indicate gross classification of brooding structures into one of the three general pouch types does not predict the energetic investment of males in parental care. but rather, physiological characterization of the relative investment by each sex to offspring is essential to understanding the functional significance of the brood pouch.
@method mir-331-3p regulates expression of neuropilin-2 in glioblastoma micrornas are small noncoding rnas that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. they play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. we examined the expression profiles of 241 human micrornas in normal tissues and the nci-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. to quantify microrna expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time pcr. most micrornas were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microrna expression revealed four groups among the nci-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. we identified specific subsets of micrornas that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. we also identified specific microrna expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the nci-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific micrornas as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. our results provide evidence that microrna expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. these findings call attention to the potential of micrornas to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.
@background the fam deubiquitylating enzyme localizes to multiple points of protein trafficking in epithelia, where it associates with e-cadherin and beta-catenin. the golgi apparatus is a dynamic organelle through which nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are transported, post-translationally modified and finally packaged into carrier vesicles for transport along the cytoskeleton to a variety of destinations. in the past decade, studies have shown that a number of 'molecular motors' are involved in maintaining the proper structure and function of the golgi apparatus. here, we review just some of the many functions performed by these mechanochemical enzymes — dyneins, kinesins, myosins and dynamin — in relation to the golgi apparatus.
@background real-time estimates of hepatic gluconeogenesis 1 real-time detection of hepatic gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic states using hyperpolarized [ 2-13 c ] dihydroxyacetone * a method is introduced for estimating the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production. 2h2o is administered orally to achieve 0.5% deuterium enrichment in body water. enrichments are determined in the hydrogens bound to carbons 2 and 6 of blood glucose and in urinary water. enrichment at carbon 6 of glucose is assayed in hexamethylenetetramine, formed from formaldehyde produced by periodate oxidation of the glucose. enrichment at carbon 2 is assayed in lactate formed by enzymatic transfer of the hydrogen from glucose via sorbitol to pyruvate. the fraction gluconeogenesis contributes to glucose production equals the ratio of the enrichment at carbon 6 to that at carbon 2 or in urinary water. applying the method, the contribution of gluconeogenesis in healthy subjects was 23-42% after fasting 14 h, increasing to 59-84% after fasting 42 h. enrichment at carbon 2 to that in urinary water was 1.12 +/- 0.13. therefore, the assumption that hydrogen equilibrated during hexose-6-p isomerization was fulfilled. the 3h/14c ratio in glucose formed from [3-3h,3-14c]lactate given to healthy subjects was 0.1 to 0.2 of that in the lactate. therefore equilibration during gluconeogenesis of the hydrogen bound to carbon 6 with that in body water was 80-90% complete, so that gluconeogenesis is underestimated by 10-20%. glycerol's contribution to gluconeogenesis is not included in these estimates. the method is applicable to studies in humans of gluconeogenesis at safe doses of 2h2o.
@method active 3d scene segmentation using kinect. this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
@background prefrontal cortex lesions augment the location-related firing properties of area te/perirhinal cortex neurons in a working memory task. 1. the dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are distributed in three cell groups: a8 region in the retrorubral field, a9 region in the substantia nigra and a10 region in the ventral tegmental area. 2. anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques combined with immunohistochemical procedures indicate a topographical organization of mesencephalic dopaminergic projections towards the hippocampal formation. 3. electrophysiological evidence suggest that dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons could have a regulatory role in suppressing hippocampal excitability. 4. the functional significance of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic system is largely unknown, although it was suggested that this projection could have a role in methamphetamine-produced hypermotility and in modulation of memory processes.
@method doppler tissue imaging: a noninvasive technique for evaluation of left ventricular relaxation and estimation of filling pressures. left atrial (la) volume measurements have been made by the application of the method of discs (modified simpson's rule) to orthogonal biplane atrial echocardiographic images. validation of the technique has been suboptimal due to deficiencies of the reference standard, levophase angiography. to define the accuracy of echocardiography, we compared la end-systolic volume by echocardiography in 27 patients with volumes by cine computed tomography (cine ct), a highly accurate and validated method of measuring cardiac chambers. echocardiographic tracings were made in the apical long-axis two- and four-chamber views. in patients with atria less than 300 ml, 14 had echoes performed prospectively, with optimization of la size, while the remaining 10 were analyzed retrospectively. the volume of each slice was calculated and was then summated to obtain total volume. the correlation coefficient between two-dimensional echocardiography and cine ct was r = 0.98, and it was r = 0.82 when patients with atria greater than 300 ml (n = 3) were excluded. echocardiography underestimated cine ct measurements by 23%. the slope of the prospective group was closer to unity than the slope of the retrospective group (p less than 0.001), and the correlation with cine ct was slightly better for the prospective group (r = 0.88 versus r = 0.77). la volume by two-dimensional echocardiography correlates closely with cine ct, a more accurate method of volume determination, and gives valid measurements of la volume. efforts to maximize la size during scanning limit inaccuracies of echocardiographic measurements of the left atrium.
@background relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
@method ultrasonographic demonstration of manipulation-related aortic injuries after cardiac surgery. background to further gain insight into atheroembolization mechanisms epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation before extracorporeal circulation and after decannulation may be helpful.   methods epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before cannulation and after decannulation in 188 (124 men) patients (mean age, 67.7 years; range, 43 to 86 years) undergoing operation with extracorporeal circulation for ischemic heart disease during 1996.   results after decannulation, a new intimal lesion was recognized in 10 of 188 patients (5.3%): mobile type in 5 patients (3 ending with a stroke [60%], 2 having brain computed tomographic scans compatible with embolism), intimal tear in 2, and intimal irregularity in 3 patients. stroke occurred in a significantly smaller number of patients (2 of 178 [1.1%]; p < 0.001) without new lesions.   conclusions clamp- or cannula-induced new lesions, especially of mobile type, are often complicated by postoperative stroke. aggressive surgical technique modifications may need to be considered to avoid creating new lesions, particularly of the mobile type.
@background computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
@background apelin treatment increases complete fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and biogenesis in muscle of insulin-resistant mice adipose tissue (at) secretes several adipokines that influence insulin sensitivity and potentially link obesity to insulin resistance. apelin, a peptide present in different tissues, is also secreted by adipocytes. apelin is upregulated in obese and hyperinsulinemic humans and mice. although a tight relation exists between the regulation of apelin and insulin, it remains largely unknown whether apelin affects whole-body glucose utilization. herein, we show that in chow-fed mice, acute intravenous injection of apelin has a powerful glucose-lowering effect associated with enhanced glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and at. through in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate the involvement of endothelial no synthase, amp-activated protein kinase, and akt in apelin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus muscle. remarkably, in obese and insulin-resistant mice, apelin restored glucose tolerance and increased glucose utilization. apelin could thus represent a promising target in the management of insulin resistance.
@background population encoding by circadian clock neurons organizes circadian behavior the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) is a master circadian pacemaker. it is not known which scn neurons are autonomous pacemakers or how they synchronize their daily firing rhythms to coordinate circadian behavior. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) and the vip receptor vpac2 (encoded by the gene vipr2) may mediate rhythms in individual scn neurons, synchrony between neurons, or both. we found that vip−/− and vipr2−/− mice showed two daily bouts of activity in a skeleton photoperiod and multiple circadian periods in constant darkness. loss of vip or vpac2 also abolished circadian firing rhythms in approximately half of all scn neurons and disrupted synchrony between rhythmic neurons. critically, daily application of a vpac2 agonist restored rhythmicity and synchrony to vip−/− scn neurons, but not to vipr2−/− neurons. we conclude that vip coordinates daily rhythms in the scn and behavior by synchronizing a small population of pacemaking neurons and maintaining rhythmicity in a larger subset of neurons.
@background antiperoxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of lycopene and ellagic acid on cyclophosphamide-induced testicular lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. the present study was undertaken to find out the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide on testicular activities along with testicular oxidative stress at its therapeutic dose and the protective effects of f -tocopherol succinate on testicular dysfunctions induced by cyclophosphamide in mature albino rats. a significant diminution in the activities of testicular j 5 , 3 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) and 17 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) along with significant reduction in the plasma level of testosterone and number of spermatogonia-a (asg), preleptotene spermatocytes (plsc), midpachytene spermatocytes (mpsc) and step 7 spermatids (7sd) at stage vii of spermatogenic cycle were observed following cyclophosphamide treatment. oxidative stress was also noted in testis, which was enlightened by significant elevation in the level of malondialdehyde (mda) and conjugated dienes along with significant reduction in the activities of testicular peroxidase and catalase. co-administration of f -tocopherol succinate in cyclophosphamide-treated rats resulted a significant restoration of all the above-mentioned parameters to the control level. the results of our experiment suggest that cyclophosphamide treatment at its clinical dose is associated with antigonadal activities as well as induction of oxidative stress in gonad that can be ameliorated significantly by f -tocopherol succinate co-administration. so, our data have some potential clinical implications.
@background novel mt1-mmp small-molecule inhibitors based on insights into hemopexin domain function in tumor growth. invasive cell migration through tissue barriers requires pericellular remodelling of extracellular matrix (ecm) executed by cell-surface proteases, particularly membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (mt1-mmp/mmp-14). using time-resolved multimodal microscopy, we show how invasive ht-1080 fibrosarcoma and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells coordinate mechanotransduction and fibrillar collagen remodelling by segregating the anterior force-generating leading edge containing β1 integrin, mt1-mmp and f-actin from a posterior proteolytic zone executing fibre breakdown. during forward movement, sterically impeding fibres are selectively realigned into microtracks of single-cell calibre. microtracks become expanded by multiple following cells by means of the large-scale degradation of lateral ecm interfaces, ultimately prompting transition towards collective invasion similar to that in vivo. both ecm track widening and transition to multicellular invasion are dependent on mt1-mmp-mediated collagenolysis, shown by broad-spectrum protease inhibition and rna interference. thus, invasive migration and proteolytic ecm remodelling are interdependent processes that control tissue micropatterning and macropatterning and, consequently, individual and collective cell migration.
@background cerebral erdheim-chester disease: case report and review of the literature two patients with erdheim-chester disease with progressive cerebellar dysfunction and pyramidal signs are reported on. cerebral mri showed bilateral increased signal intensity in peridentatal regions on t2 weighted sequences. both patients had kidney and bone involvement, established on bone biopsy for one. one patient improved with steroid therapy. this contrasts with previous reports, which describe rare neurological manifestations and the failure of different therapeutic approaches.
@method modulating the folding of p-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
@background n-acetyl cysteine plus clomiphene citrate versus metformin and clomiphene citrate in treatment of clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial. aim. to elucidate the dynamics of fsh, lh, prolactin (prl), tsh and insulin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) treated with metformin (met). patients and methods. in a prospective, controlled and randomised trial, 32 women with pcos and 32 with normal cycle were recruited to receive met (850 mg b.i.d.) or placebo (n: 16 for each subgroup) for an average of 40 days. pituitary function and insulin secretion were assessed before and after intervention by gnrh-trh tests and oral glucose tolerance test induced insulin response. results. basal and area under the response curve (aurc) lh values were higher in pcos than in normal controls before met and declined following treatment in the former group (p < 0.05). ovulatory pcos responders had lower basal lh, aurclh and aurcprl values during met than anovulatory cases (p < 0.05 for all) and aurcins was lower in ovulatory than anovulatory pcos before and on met (p < 0.02–p < 0.05), with a rise of quicky index in the former group during met treatment (p < 0.05). fsh and tsh were similar. conclusions. met administration lowered lh activity in all pcos women and in ovulatory responders and also compromised prl stimulated secretion in the latter cases. these findings were indicative of an effect of met on pituitary activity.
@method no evidence for a fundamental visual motion processing deficit in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
@method bi-alphabetism: a window on phonological processing reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., forster & dickinson, 1976). mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., baayen, davidson, & bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. in this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the rts. we advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. we also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. these strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.
@result the effects of sexual experience and estrus on male-seeking motivated behavior in the female rat choice of a male or female social contact was studied in intact female rats in a runway-choice apparatus during estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation. the male was chosen significantly more often during proestrus/estrus than during the diestrous days of the cycle. during pregnancy this preference in choice declined only to reappear gradually during the lactation period. the shifts in the level of motivation to seek out the male support previous studies and point to the significance of estrogen in producing the preference for the male.
@background comparison of gene expression profile between tumor tissue and adjacent non-tumor tissue in patients with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) background and aims resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists). we investigated the mechanisms of resistance in patients with progressive gists with primary kit mutations and the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor pkc412 for the inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants.   methods we performed a cytogenetic analysis and screened for mutations of the kit and pdgfra kinase domains in 26 resistant gists. kit autophosphorylation status was assessed by western immunoblotting. imatinib-resistant gist cells and ba/f3 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for sensitivity to imatinib and pkc412.   results six distinct secondary mutations in kit were detected in 12 progressive tumors, with v654a and t670i found to be recurrent. one progressive tumor showed acquired pdgfra -d842v mutation. amplification of kit or kit / pdgfra was found in 2 patients. eight of 10 progressive tumors available for analysis showed phosphorylated kit. two remaining progressive tumors lost kit protein expression. gist cells carrying kit -del557-558/t670i or kit -insay502-503/v654a mutations were resistant to imatinib, while pkc412 significantly inhibited autophosporylation of these mutants. resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to pkc412 of kit -t670i and pdgfra -d842v mutants was confirmed using ba/f3 cells.   conclusions this study shows the high frequency of kit/pdgfra kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance and defines genomic amplification of kit / pdgfra as an alternative cause of resistance to the drug. in a subset of patients, cancer cells lost their dependence on the targeted tyrosine kinase. our findings show the sensitivity of the imatinib-resistant kit -t670i and kit -v654a and of pdgfra -d842v mutants to pkc412.
@method serine‐o‐sulphate transport by the human glutamate transporter, eaat2 reuptake plays an important role in regulating synaptic and extracellular concentrations of glutamate. three glutamate transporters expressed in human motor cortex, termed eaat1, eaat2, and eaat3 (for excitatory amino acid transporter), have been characterized by their molecular cloning and functional expression. each eaat subtype mrna was found in all human brain regions analyzed. the most prominent regional variation in message content was in cerebellum where eaat1 expression predominated. eaat1 and eaat3 mrnas were also expressed in various non- nervous tissues, whereas expression of eaat2 was largely restricted to brain. the kinetic parameters and pharmacological characteristics of transport mediated by each eaat subtype were determined in transfected mammalian cells by radio-label uptake and in microinjected oocytes by voltage-clamp measurements. the affinities of the eaat subtypes for l- glutamate were similar, with km determinations varying from 48 to 97 microm in the mammalian cell assay and from 18 to 28 microm in oocytes. glutamate uptake inhibitors were used to compare the pharmacologies of the eaat subtypes. the eaat2 subtype was distinguishable from the eaat1/eaat3 subtypes by the potency of several inhibitors, but most notably by sensitivity to kainic acid (ka) and dihydrokainic acid (dhk). ka and dhk potently inhibited eaat2 transport, but did not significantly affect transport by eaat1/eaat3. using voltage-clamp measurements, most inhibitors were found to be substrates that elicited transport currents. in contrast, ka and dhk did not evoke currents and they were found to block eaat2-mediated transport competitively. this selective interaction with the eaat2 subtype could be a significant factor in ka neurotoxicity. these studies provide a foundation for understanding the role of glutamate transporters in human excitatory neurotransmission and in neuropathology.
@method itep: an integrated toolkit for exploration of microbial pan-genomes a discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the markov cluster process or the mcl process. the process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the mcl algorithm. the mcl process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. expansion corresponds with taking the $k$th power of a stochastic matrix, where $k\in\n$. inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator $\gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. the image $\gamma_r m$ is obtained by raising each entry in $m$ to the $r$th power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. in practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. the heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. the process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph $g$, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of $g$. the limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the mcl algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. several mathematical properties of the mcl process are established. most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. the inflation operator $\gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. the phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. for $r\in\n$ and for $m$ a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image $\gamma_r m$ is again dpsd. determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix $m$ imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of $m$, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. the spectrum of $\gamma_{\infty} m$ is of the form $\{0^{n-k}, 1^k\}$, where $k$ is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with $m$, and $n$ is the dimension of $m$. this attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.
@result parkin somatic mutations link melanoma and parkinson's disease. the parkin was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. deregulation of the parkin gene, however, has been observed in various human cancers, suggesting that the parkin gene may be important in tumorigenesis. to gain insight into the physiologic role of parkin, we generated parkin−/− mice lacking exon 3 of the parkin gene. we demonstrated here that parkin−/− mice had enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and developed macroscopic hepatic tumors with the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. microarray analyses revealed that parkin deficiency caused the alteration of gene expression profiles in the liver. among them, endogenous follistatin is commonly upregulated in both nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues of parkin-deficient mice. parkin deficiency resulted in suppression of caspase activation and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a follistatin-dependent manner. these results suggested that parkin deficiency caused enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, resulting in hepatic tumor development, partially through the upregulation of endogenous follistatin. the finding that parkin-deficient mice are susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis provided the first evidence showing that parkin is indeed a tumor suppressor gene.
@background the carma3-bcl10-malt1 signalosome drives nfκb activation and promotes aggressiveness in angiotensin ii receptor-positive breast cancer. the paracaspase malt1 has a central role in the activation of lymphocytes and other immune cells including myeloid cells, mast cells and nk cells. malt1 activity is required not only for the immune response, but also for the development of natural treg cells that keep the immune response in check. exaggerated malt1 activity has been associated with the development of lymphoid malignancies, and recently developed malt1 inhibitors show promising anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of diffuse large b cell lymphoma. in this review, we provide an overview of the present understanding of malt1’s function, and discuss possibilities for its therapeutic targeting based on recently developed inhibitors and animal models.
@background clinical, hematological and biochemical alterations in hamster (mesocricetus auratus) experimentally infected with leishmania infantum through different routes of inoculation to develop and test new therapeutics and immune prophylaxis strategies for visceral leishmaniasis (vl), understanding tissue parasitism evolution after experimental infection with leishmania infantum is important. experimental infection in a hamster model (mesocricetus auratus) reproduces several typical aspects of canine and human vl that are closely related to the inoculum’s route. we quantified the parasitism in the liver and spleen of hamsters experimentally infected by various routes (intradermal, intraperitoneal, and intracardiac [ic]) and different strains of l. infantum (mhom/br/74/pp75 and wild) and compared two different methodologies to evaluate tissue parasitism (leishman donovan units [ldu] and real-time qpcr). in addition, the quantification of specific total-igg in the serum of uninfected and infected hamsters was determined by elisa. the animals were followed for 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-infection for survival analysis. we found that infection with the wild strain by the ic route resulted in higher mortality. positive antibody (igg) responses were detected with higher peaks at 6 and 9 months in the ic group inoculated with pp75 strain. however, in animals infected with the wild strain the igg levels were elevated in all infected groups during all the time evaluated. we also observed by ldu analysis that the ic route lead to higher parasitism in the liver and spleen with both strains. furthermore, qpcr showed higher sensitivity for identifying animals with low parasitic burden. in conclusion, qpcr can be useful for assessing parasitism in the spleen and liver of a hamster model infected with l. infantum independent of the route of infection, and this technique may become an essential tool for assessing parasite density in the hamster model after experimental treatment or immunization with potential vaccine candidates.
@method unsupervised acquisition of comprehensive multiword lexicons using competition in an n-gram lattice multiword expressions (mwes) are quite frequent in languages such as english, but their diversity, the scarcity of individual mwe types, and contextual ambiguity have presented obstacles to corpus-based studies and nlp systems addressing them as a class. here we advocate for a comprehensive annotation approach: proceeding sentence by sentence, our annotators manually group tokens into mwes according to guidelines that cover a broad range of multiword phenomena. under this scheme, we have fully annotated an english web corpus for multiword expressions, including those containing gaps.
@method quantification of bovine milk protein composition and coagulation properties using infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics: a result of collinearity among reference variables. the objective of this study was to examine variation in overall milk, protein, and mineral composition of bovine milk in relation to rennet-induced coagulation, with the aim of elucidating the underlying causes of milk with impaired coagulation abilities. on the basis of an initial screening of 892 milk samples from 42 herds with danish jersey and holstein-friesian cows, a subset of 102 samples was selected to represent milk with good, poor, or noncoagulating properties (i.e., samples that within each breed represented the most extremes in regard to coagulation properties). milk with good coagulation characteristics was defined as milk forming a strong coagulum based on oscillatory rheology, as indicated by high values for maximum coagulum strength (g'(max)) and curd firming rate (cfr) and a short rennet coagulation time. poorly coagulating milk formed a weak coagulum, with a low g'(max) and cfr and a long rennet coagulation time. noncoagulating milk was defined as milk that failed to form a coagulum, having g'(max) and cfr values of zero at measurements taken within 1h after addition of rennet. for both breeds, a lower content of total protein, total casein (cn) and κ-cn, and lower levels of minerals (ca, p, mg) were identified in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk in comparison with milk with good coagulation properties. liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a great variety of genetic variants of the major milk proteins, namely, α(s1)-cn (variants b and c), α(s2)-cn (a), β-cn (a(1), a(2), b, i, and f), κ-cn (a, b, and e), α-lactalbumin (b), and β-lactoglobulin (a, b, and c). in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk samples of both breeds, the predominant composite genotype of α(s1)-, β-, and κ-cn was bb-a(2)a(2)-aa, which confirmed a genetic contribution to impaired milk coagulation. interestingly, subtle variations in posttranslational modification of cn were observed between the coagulation classes in both breeds. poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk contained a lower fraction of the least phosphorylated α(s1)-cn form, α(s1)-cn 8p, relative to total α(s1)-cn, along with a lower fraction of glycosylated κ-cn relative to total κ-cn. thus, apparent variation was observed in the milk and protein composition, in the genetic makeup of the major milk proteins, and in the posttranslational modification level of cn between milk samples with either good or impaired coagulation ability, whereas the composition of poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk was similar.
@background cyld inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis by blocking jnk/ap1 signaling at multiple levels familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the cyld protein of previously unknown function. here we show that cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor nf-κb by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (tnfrs). loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis. cyld inhibits activation of nf-κb by the tnfr family members cd40, xedar and edar in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of cyld. downregulation of cyld by rna-mediated interference augments both basal and cd40-mediated activation of nf-κb. the inhibition of nf-κb activation by cyld is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of tnfr-associated factor 2 (traf2) and, to a lesser extent, traf6. these results indicate that cyld is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of nf-κb that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.
@background unusual complications of quinalphos poisoning pancreatitis secondary to organophosphate insecticide toxicity is rare and is believed to follow a subclinical and uneventful course. we report two cases of severe acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and retroperitoneal sepsis in which the diagnosis was obscured by the systemic effects of organophosphate toxicity. awareness of this complication should prompt earlier investigation because early diagnosis coupled with timely therapeutic measures may improve patient prognosis.
@background dishevelled binds the discs large ‘hook’ domain to activate gukholder-dependent spindle positioning in drosophila the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (maguk) scaffold proteins comprises members that function at neuronal synapses, tight junctions, immunological synapses, and neutrophil membranes. through their multiple domains, maguks organize events of signal transduction, cell adhesion, and molecular trafficking. here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, and rosetta modeling to reveal the structural preferences and interdomain dynamics of the maguk core (pdz3-sh3-guanylate kinase) from postsynaptic density-95 (psd-95), the best known maugk. psd-95 is highly abundant in the postsynaptic density of excitatory neurons and is responsible for coupling glutamate receptors with internal postsynaptic structures. these solution-based studies show that the maguk core pdz domain (pdz3) interacts directly with the sh3 domain via its canonical peptide binding groove, with the connecting linker serving as an adhesive. this weak interaction, however, is dynamic and weakened further by pdz3 ligands and linker phosphorylation, suggesting that domain dynamics may be central to maguk function.
@method early outcomes of surgery for small bowel obstruction: analysis of risk factors aim gastrografin is a hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast medium. besides its predictive value for the need for operative treatment, a potential therapeutic role of this agent in adhesive small bowel obstruction has been suggested. this study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction when conservative treatment failed.   methods patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction were given trial conservative treatment unless there was fear of bowel strangulation. those responded in the initial 48 h had conservative treatment continued. patients who showed no improvement in the initial 48 h were given 100 ml of gastrografin through nasogastric tube followed by serial abdominal radiographs. patients with the contrast appeared in large bowel within 24 h were regarded as having partial obstruction and conservative treatment was continued. patients in which the contrast failed to reach large bowel within 24 h were considered to have complete obstruction and laparotomy was performed.   results two hundred and twelve patients with 245 episodes of adhesive obstruction were included. fifteen patients were operated on soon after admission due to fear of strangulation. one hundred and eighty-six episodes of obstruction showed improvement in the initial 48 h and conservative treatment was continued. two patients had subsequent operations because of persistent obstruction. forty-four episodes of obstruction showed no improvement within 48 h and gastrografin was administered. seven patients underwent complete obstruction surgery. partial obstruction was demonstrated in 37 other cases, obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them except one patient who required laparotomy because of persistent obstruction. the overall operative rate in this study was 10%. there was no complication that could be attributed to the use of gastrografin.   conclusion the use of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction after unsuccessful conservative treatment is safe and reduces the need for surgical intervention.
@method fuse: full spectral clustering despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
@method training effective node classifiers for cascade classification pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. in recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. however, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. to address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. we make three primary contributions: 1) we put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. in particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.
@background evolution of the hypoxia-sensitive cells involved in amniote respiratory reflexes visualizing the beginnings of melanoma in cancer biology, a tumor begins from a single cell within a group of precancerous cells that share genetic mutations. kaufman et al. used a zebrafish melanoma model to visualize cancer initiation (see the perspective by boumahdi and blanpain). they used a fluorescent reporter that specifically lit up neural crest progenitors that are only present during embryogenesis or during adult melanoma tumor formation. the appearance of this tumor correlated with a set of gene regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, whose identification and manipulation may prove beneficial in detecting and preventing melanoma initiation. science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2197; see also p. 453 melanocytes with oncogenic or tumor suppressor mutations revert to expressing the crestin gene early in melanoma formation. [also see perspective by boumahdi and blanpain] introduction the “cancerized field” concept posits that cells in a given tissue sharing an oncogenic mutation are cancer-prone, yet only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. studying the process of cancer initiation has remained challenging because of (i) the rarity of these events, (ii) the difficulty of visiualizing initiating clones in living organisms, and (iii) the transient nature of a newly transformed clone emerging before it expands to form an early tumor. a more complete understanding of the molecular processes that regulate cancer initiation could provide important prognostic information about which precancerous lesions are most prone to becoming cancer and also implicate druggable molecular pathways that, when inhibited, may prevent the cancer from ever starting. rationale the majority of benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations and can be considered a cancerized field of melanocytes, but they only rarely convert to melanoma. in an effort to define events that initiate cancer, we used a melanoma model in the zebrafish in which the human brafv600e oncogene is driven by the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter. when bred into a p53 mutant background, these fish develop melanoma tumors over the course of many months. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and is specifically reexpressed only in melanoma tumors, making it an ideal candidate for tracking melanoma from initiation onward. results we developed a crestin:egfp reporter that recapitulates the embryonic neural crest expression pattern of crestin and its expression in melanoma tumors. we show through live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, and this establishes that a fate change occurs at melanoma initiation in this model. early crestin+ patches of cells expand and are transplantable in a manner consistent with their possessing tumorigenic activity, and they exhibit a gene expression pattern consistent with the ncp identity readout by the crestin reporter. the crestin element is regulated by ncp transcription factors, including sox10. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, whereas crispr/cas9 targeting of sox10 delayed melanoma onset. we show activation of super-enhancers at ncp genes in both zebrafish and human melanomas, identifying an epigenetic mechanism for control of this ncp signature leading to melanoma. conclusion this work using our zebrafish melanoma model and in vivo reporter of ncp identity allows us to see cancer from its birth as a single cell and shows the importance of ncp-state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation from a field of cancer-prone melanocytes. thus, in addition to the typical fixed genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor supressors that are required for cancer development, the reemergence of progenitor identity may be an additional rate-limiting step in the formation of melanoma. preventing ncp reemergence in a field of cancer-prone melanocytes may thus prove therapeutically useful, and the association of ncp genes with super-enhancer regulatory elements implicates the associated druggable epigenetic machinery in this process. neural crest reporter expression in melanoma. the crestin:egfp transgene is specifically expressed in melanoma in brafv600e/p53 mutant melanoma-prone zebrafish. (top) a single cell expressing crestin:egfp expands into a small patch of cells over the course of 2 weeks, capturing the initiation of melanoma formation (bracket). (bottom) a fully formed melanoma specifically expresses crestin:egfp, whereas the rest of the fish remains egfp-negative. the “cancerized field” concept posits that cancer-prone cells in a given tissue share an oncogenic mutation, but only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. most benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations but rarely become melanoma. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and specifically reexpressed in melanoma. live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters shows that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, revealing a fate change at melanoma initiation in this model. ncp transcription factors, including sox10, regulate crestin expression. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, which is consistent with activation of ncp genes and super-enhancers leading to melanoma. our work highlights ncp state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation.
@method conservation planning for biodiversity and wilderness: a real-world example marxan is software that delivers decision support for reserve system design. marxan was initially designed to solve a particular class of reserve design problems known as the minimum set problem (see box 1.1) where the goal is to achieve some minimum representation of biodiversity features for the smallest possible cost. marxan helps users to determine the possible contribution of individual areas and whole networks towards meeting their objectives. users may use marxan to explore and propose possible network configurations, to facilitate collaborative network design, or to guide their own land acquisition / marine zoning. marxan is not designed to act as a stand-alone reserve design solution. its effectiveness is dependent upon the involvement of people, the adoption of sound ecological principles, the establishment of scientifically defensible conservation goals and targets and the construction of spatial datasets. marxan should be used as part of a systematic conservation planning process (outlined in this chapter) and in collaboration with other forms of knowledge. these other forms of knowledge are essential to the refinement of marxan inputs, the interpretation of marxan outcomes and the precise placement of final reserve boundaries. because it seeks spatially efficient solutions, based on a defined problem, marxan represents a significant step forward from earlier approaches of scoring sites. nonetheless, there is a significant amount of uncertainty in selecting sites, which is but one aspect of systematic conservation planning, the final step of which is monitoring to evaluate whether the sites make meaningful contributions to the network. 1.1 overview of systematic conservation planning 1.1.1 what is systematic conservation planning? world-leading conservation planning processes, both marine and terrestrial, are employing an approach known as systematic conservation planning (pressey et al. 1993, noss and cooperrider 1994, davey 1998, pressey 1999, margules and pressey 2000, groves 2003, noss 2003, leslie 2005). systematic conservation planning focuses on locating, designing and managing protected areas that comprehensively represent the biodiversity of each region (mace et al. 2006). this approach to planning involves

@background a fiber-based ratiometric optical cardiac mapping channel using a diffraction grating and split detector. transmembrane voltage-sensitive fluorescence measurements are limited by baseline drift that can obscure changes in resting membrane potential and by motion artifacts that can obscure repolarization. voltage-dependent shift of emission wavelengths may allow reduction of drift and motion artifacts by emission ratiometry. we have tested this for action potentials and potassium-induced changes in resting membrane potential in rabbit hearts stained with di-4-anepps [pyridinium, 4-(2-(6-(dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-, hydroxide, inner salt] using laser excitation (488 nm) and a two-photomultiplier tube system or spectrofluorometer (resolution of 500-1,000 hz and <1 mm). green and red emissions produced upright and inverted action potentials, respectively. ratios of green emission to red emission followed action potential contours and exhibited larger fractional changes than either emission alone (p < 0.001). the largest changes and signal-to-noise ratio (signal/noise) were obtained with numerator wavelengths of 525-550 nm and denominator wavelengths of 650-700 nm. ratiometry lessened drift 56-66% (p < 0.015) and indicated decreases in resting membrane potential. ratiometry lessened motion artifacts and increased magnitudes of deflections representing phase-zero depolarizations relative to total deflections by 123-188% in intact hearts (p < 0.02). durations of action potentials at different pacing rates, temperatures, and potassium concentrations were independent of whether they were measured ratiometrically or with microelectrodes (p > or = 0.65). the ratiometric calibration slope was 0.017/100 mv and decreased with time. thus emission ratiometry lessens the effects of motion and drift and indicates resting membrane potential changes and repolarization.
@background clinical outcomes after multiligament injured knees: medial versus lateral reconstructions medial-sided knee injuries can result in pain, instability, and loss of function. many clinical studies have been written on the treatment of medial-sided knee injuries; however, the vast majority are isolated case series of surgical or nonoperative treatment regimens, and only a few randomized prospective clinical trials can be found in the literature that compare different treatment modalities. comparison of these treatments is challenging due to the variety of medial-sided structures that can be involved, the multiple different approaches to treatment, and the variability of how objective and subjective clinical outcomes are reported. in this paper we report on the injuries by extent and type of anatomic structures damaged including partial medial-sided injuries, completed isolated medial-sided knee injuries, and combined injuries. in general, most authors concur that isolated partial or complete medial collateral ligament (mcl) injuries can be treated nonoperatively with a brace and early motion with good clinical outcomes. prospective, randomized trials support nonoperative treatment of the mcl in combined anterior cruciate ligament-mcl injuries. knee dislocations and posterior medial corner injuries appear to have better results with surgical management including reconstruction. multiple reconstructive techniques have been described for chronic injuries but it is difficult to compare their results.
@background fluoride retention in proximal plaque and saliva using two naf dentifrices containing 5,000 and 1,450 ppm f with and without water rinsing the aim of this paper was to describe what experts of today believe are the main reasons explaining the caries decline seen in many westernized countries over the past 3 decades. we have collected the views of a number of international experts, trying to answer the specific question "what are the main reasons why 20-25-year-old persons have less caries nowadays, compared to 30 years ago?". a questionnaire was mailed to 55 experts with a number of thinkable explanations to be scored according to a predetermined scale. the 25 items were divided into main groups under the heading of diet, fluorides, plaque, saliva, dentist/dental materials and other factors. the experts were asked to think of a specific country or area, and also to specify whether the chosen area had water fluoridation or not. the main finding of our study, based on a 95% response rate, was that there is a very large variation in how the experts graded the impact of various possible factors. for the use of fluoride toothpaste, there was a clear agreement of a definite positive effect.

@background previous institutionalization is followed by broader amygdala–hippocampal–pfc network connectivity during aversive learning in human development development of anxiety disorders is associated with neurobiological changes in areas that are a critical part of the fear neurocircuitry. fear conditioning paradigms can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying the neurobiological ontogeny of anxiety. a small number of studies have focused on the effects of age and anxiety separately in school age children. the present study aimed to investigate these effects in 8-13 year old children with higher and lower trait anxiety. we examined differential fear conditioning and extinction using skin conductance responses and fear-potentiated startle in 60 children recruited from a low-income urban population. the results indicated that children under 10 years of age show poor discrimination of conditioned stimuli, and that anxiety increases fear responses during fear acquisition. after controlling for age and trauma exposure, fear-potentiated startle to the safety cue predicted child anxiety levels suggesting that impaired safety signal learning may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders in adulthood. identifying risk phenotypes in children may provide opportunities for early intervention and prevention of illness.
@background lectin-reactive α-fetoprotein (afp-l3%) curability and prediction of clinical course after treatment of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors we report false elevations of serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 4 patients with testicular germ cell tumors. elevated circulating luteinizing hormone levels that resulted from unilateral orchiectomy were responsible for the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin activity measured in commercial radioimmunoassays. in 3 patients tested aliquots of serum evaluated in reliable human chorionic gonadotropin assay systems revealed no elevation. we administered testosterone to 3 patients who had elevations of luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels. luteinizing hormone was suppress-d to normal levels 1 week later in 2 patients and in 1 it was diminished but still slightly elevated. in all 3 cases the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin results converted to negative. recognition of falsely positive elevations of human chorionic gonadotropin can spare patients unnecessary operations and/or chemotherapy.
@method skin barrier homeostasis in atopic dermatitis: feedback regulation of kallikrein activity apoptosis is an important physiological process crucially involved in development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. although the major signaling pathways have been unraveled, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying network remains elusive. we have translated here the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the death-receptor-activated caspase cascade into a mathematical model. a reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. in addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.
@result load handling and repetitive movements are associated with chronic low back pain among jute mill workers in india a cross-sectional study of 150 adult bengalee hindu male jute mill workers of belur, a suburb of kolkata, west bengal, india, was undertaken to study the relationship of age, body mass index (bmi) and waist circumference (wc) with systolic (sbp), diastolic (dbp) and mean arterial (map) blood pressure. the mean age and the bmi of the subjects were 40.7 years (s.d. = 15.2) and 23.2 kg/m2 (s.d. = 3.2), respectively. the mean sbp, dbp and map were 124.7 mmhg (s.d. = 7.8), 81.5 mmhg (s.d. = 5.7) and 95.9 mmhg (s.d. = 6.1), respectively. age had similar significant (p < 0.001) correlations with bmi and wc. age and wc were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with all the three blood pressure variables. in general, the correlations of bmi with sbp (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), dbp (r = 0.15, n.s.) and map (r = 0.19, p < 0.05) were weaker. age controlled multiple regression analyses demonstrated that bmi did not have a significant effect of any blood pressure variable. however, wc had a significant impact (p < 0.0001) on sbp (t = 7.068), dbp (t = 5.190) and map (t = 6.387), even after adjusting for the effect of age. moreover, even after age adjustment, percent variations in sbp (20.7%), dbp (12.5%) and map (17.2%) explained by wc were high. this significant impact (p < 0.0001) of wc on sbp (t = 9.426), dbp (t = 8.349) and map (t = 9.642) remained even after controlling for the combined effects of age and bmi.
@background comparison between k3edta and lithium heparin as anticoagulant to isolate bovine granulocytes from blood neutrophils play a key role in initiating an innate immune response, being the first type of immune cell arriving at the site of injury or infection. these cells are able to mount a direct anti-bactericidal response by the production of reactive oxygen or reactive nitrogen species (ros/rns). an important component of the host innate immune response is recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) by pattern recognition receptors (prrs). toll-like receptors (tlrs) are an important family of prrs and, are a key component in activation of innate immune mechanisms. in the present study we described the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr1, tlr2, tlr4, tlr6, tlr7 and tlr10 in bovine neutrophils. in contrast, the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr3 varied between animals, whereas no transcripts were detected for tlr5, tlr8, tlr9 or the c-type lectin receptor dectin-1 in neutrophils isolated from bovine blood. additionally, zymosan, a dectin-1/tlr2 ligand, induced ros, but not rns production in a cd11b-, but not dectin-1-dependent manner. this effect was dependent on store operated calcium entry (soce), and partially inhibited using monoclonal antibodies to cd11b. taken together, our data describe the presence of specific prrs transcripts in the mrna isolated from bovine neutrophil and show a cd11b-/ca(2+) dependent ros production by these cells.
@background active specific immunotherapy targeting the wilms' tumor protein 1 (wt1) for patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors: lessons from early clinical trials. the wild-type wilms tumor gene, wt1, is overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) as well as acute myeloid leukemia. in a phase i clinical trial of biweekly vaccination with hla-a*2402-restricted wt1 peptide for these malignancies, 2 patients with mds developed severe leukocytopenia in association with a reduction in leukemic blast cells and levels of wt1 messenger rna (mrna) after only a single vaccination with 0.3 mg of wt1 peptide. these results indicated that the wt1-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (ctls) elicited by wt1 vaccination eradicated the wt1-expressing transformed stem or progenitor cells and that mds patients with little normal hematopoiesis required a new strategy of wt1 vaccination to avoid severe leukocytopenia. we describe the first trial for a 57-year-old male patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who was vaccinated biweekly with a small quantity (5 microg/body) of wt1 peptide. after the start of vaccination, the leukocyte and monocyte counts (13,780/microl and 1930/microl, respectively) gradually decreased to within the normal range in association with a reduction in the wt1 mrna level. simultaneously, the percentage of wt1-specific ctls as measured by the hla-wt1 tetramer assay increased. this case demonstrates for the first time that vaccination with as little as 5 microg of wt1 peptide can induce wt1-specific immune responses and resultant clinical responses.
@result exogenous orienting of crossmodal attention in 3-d space: support for a depth-aware crossmodal attentional system two experiments were conducted to explore whether attentional selection occurs in depth, or whether attentional focus is “depth blind,” as suggested by ghiradelli and folk (1996). in experiment 1, observers viewed stereoscopic displays in which one of four spatial locations was cued. two of the locations were at a near-depth location and two were at a far-depth location, and a single target was presented along with three distractors. the results indicated a larger cost in reaction time for switching attention inx,y and depth than inx,y alone, supporting a “depth-aware” attentional spotlight. in experiment 2, no distractors were present, similar to the displays used by ghiradelli and folk. in this experiment, no effect for switching attention in depth was found, indicating that the selectivity of attention in depth depends on the perceptual load imposed on observers by the tasks and displays.
@background induction and inhibition of ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutations in hypermutator bacteria the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.
@background natural killer cell receptor genes in the family equidae: not only ly49 problem: equine chorionic girdle cells are a subpopulation of highly invasive trophoblast cells that attach and invade the uterine epithelium on day 35 (day 0 = day of ovulation). these invading chorionic girdle cells form endometrial cups that are associated with a marked local maternal leukocytic response that may result in the demise of the cups at day 120 of pregnancy. once endometrial cups become established in the uterine wall they do not express mhc antigens, and therefore may only be susceptible to non‐mhc restricted cytotoxic cells. the susceptibility of cultured chorionic girdle cells to lak cell cytotoxicity was tested in order to evaluate the role of this type of cytotoxicity in the life‐cycle of endometrial cup tissue.
@method immune antibodies and helminth products drive cxcr2-dependent macrophage-myofibroblast crosstalk to promote intestinal repair because abnormalities of mucosal immunity have been suggested in human iga nephropathy, we examined the involvement of mucosal immunity in iga deposition to the kidney in hyper iga (higa) mice, which was established as a mouse model for human iga nephropathy with hyperserum iga. the number of surface iga+b220− lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria (lp) of higa mice increased 2.7-fold at 30 wk of age as compared with those at 10 wk of age, whereas normal mice did not show such increase. the surface iga+b220− lp lymphocytes spontaneously secreted iga in culture. morphological studies showed that the surface iga+b220− lymphocytes of murine intestinal lp are identical with plasma cells (pcs). about 20% of iga+b220− pc in lp expressed both mac-1 and cd19, suggesting that they may derive from peritoneal b-1 cells. cell cycle study on intestinal iga-pcs using bromodeoxyuridine revealed no difference between higa mice and normal mice, suggesting that the high frequency of iga-producing pcs in higa mice is not due to enhanced proliferation or prolonged survival of iga-producing pcs in lp. in addition, iga secretion into the gut lumen of higa mice decreased drastically (to one forth) with aging. these data suggest that the increased number of intestinal iga-producing pcs and the down-regulation of iga excretion into the intestinal lumen might synergistically contribute to the hyperserum iga in higa mice and resultant iga deposition to the kidney.
@background independent roles for the dorsal paraflocculus and vermal lobule vii of the cerebellum in visuomotor coordination summaryfollowing small lesions of the first sensorimotor (msi) and second somatosensory (sii) cortical areas the ensuing degeneration in the inferior olives was studied with the nauta method in 14 cats.no convincing signs of degeneration were found in the olives in cases with lesions restricted to the first and second somatosensory areas (si and sii). following lesions of the primary “motor” cortex (anterior sigmoid gyrus and rostral part of the coronal gyrus) degeneration was consistently found in the olive of both sides. the contralateral projection is somewhat more abundant than the ipsilateral, but both are modest.degeneration is restricted to certain parts of the olivary complex (see fig. 11). lesions restricted to different somatotopical subdivisions of the primary “motor” cortex give rise to degeneration distributed in a somatotopical pattern in certain areas of the medial and dorsal accessory olives and the rostral part of the ventral lamella. somatotopical patterns could not be established in the smaller projections to some other minor olivary regions.when the findings are correlated with the pattern of the olivocerebellar projection it can be concluded that there is a somatotopically organized direct corticoolivo-cerebellar pathway to the intermediate part of the anterior lobe, the posterior vermis and the crus ii.attempts to correlate the findings with physiological observations are difficult. it appears that the current view that climbing fibres arise only in the olive may need revision. the role of the pontine nuclei in mediating somatotopically localized cerebellocerebellar impulses appears to have been underestimated.
@background molecular cloning and characterization of an nadph quinone oxidoreductase from kluyveromyces marxianus. dt-diaphorase, also referred to as nqo1 or nad(p)h: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones and quinonoid compounds to hydroquinones, using either nadh or nadph as the electron donor. nrh (dihydronicotinamide riboside): quinone oxidoreductase, also referred to as nqo2, has a high nucleotide sequence identity to dt-diaphorase and is considered to be an isozyme of dt-diaphorase. these enzymes transfer two electrons to a quinone, resulting in the formation of a hydroquinone product without the accumulation of a dissociated semiquinone. steady and rapid-reaction kinetic experiments have been performed to determine the reaction mechanism of dt-diaphorase. furthermore, chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been performed to determine the molecular basis of the catalytic differences between the two isozymes and to identify the critical amino acid residues that interact with various inhibitors of the enzymes. in addition, functional studies of a natural occurring mutant pro-187 to ser (p187s) have been carried out. results obtained from these investigations are summarized and discussed.

@background regulation of p27kip1 protein levels contributes to mitogenic effects of the ret/ptc kinase in thyroid carcinoma cells according to current concepts, the cell cycle commitment after restriction (r) point passage requires the sustained stimulation by mitogens of the synthesis of labile d-type cyclins, which associate with cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4/6 to phosphorylate prb family proteins and sequester the cdk inhibitor p27kip1. in primary cultures of dog thyroid epithelial cells, the camp-dependent cell cycle induced by a sustained stimulation by thyrotropin or forskolin differs from growth factor mitogenic pathways, as camp does not upregulate d-type cyclins but increases p27 levels. instead, camp induces the assembly of required cyclin d3-cdk4 complexes, which associate with nuclear p27. in this study, the arrest of forskolin stimulation rapidly slowed down the entry of dog thyrocytes into s phase and the phosphorylation of prb family proteins. the prb kinase activity, but not the formation, of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 complex was strongly reduced. using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a phosphorylated form of cdk4 was separated. it appeared in response to forskolin and was bound to both cyclin d3 and p27, presumably reflecting the activating thr-172 phosphorylation of cdk4. upon forskolin withdrawal or after cycloheximide addition, this cdk4 phosphoform unexpectedly persisted in p27 complexes devoid of cyclin d3 but it disappeared from the more labile cyclin d3 complexes. these data demonstrate that the assembly of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 holoenzyme and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of cdk4 depend on distinct camp actions. this provides a first example of a crucial regulation of cdk4 phosphorylation by a mitogenic cascade and a novel mechanism of cell cycle control at the r point.
@result astragalus membranaceus extract attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells via nf-κb activation and nrf2 response astragalus membranaceus, also known as huang qi, a traditional chinese medicine, is often used in formulas for deficiency of vital energy characterized by limb weakness, pale face, and dizziness. previous studies have shown that astragalus membranaceus could attenuate intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by hemorrhagic shock in rats; however, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. using a hemorrhagic shock rat model to examine the effect of astragalus membranaceus on intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion, we found that treatment (20 g crude drugs/kg, i.v.) produced antioxidative effects in the intestinal mucosa of rats after ischemia-reperfusion (p < 0.05). we also found that astragalus membranaceus could partly attenuate intestinal mucosa ischemia-reperfusion injury (chiu's score, apoptosis index p < 0.05). these results suggest that astragalus membranaceus reduces intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats, at least in part, through its anti-oxidative effects.

(1991) febs lett. 289, 257-259) and the genomic clone, positions of introns and exons were determined. the isolated apxi gene was found to contain 9 introns, the first of which was located within the 5'-untranslated region of the mrna. southern blot analysis of pea genomic dna suggests that in pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase is encoded by a single copy gene. steady state apxi transcript levels were found to increase in response to several stresses imposed by drought, heat, and application of ethephon, abscisic acid, and the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. increases in ascorbate peroxidase activity in response to stresses were less marked than changes observed in transcript levels; cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase protein levels measured by immunoblot analysis remained unchanged.
@background submicroscopic deletion of 5q involving tumor suppressor genes (ctnna1, hspa9) and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity associated with tet2 and ezh2 mutations in a case of mds with normal chromosome and fish results loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 7q is common in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, pointing toward the essential role of this region in disease phenotype and clonal evolution. the higher resolution offered by recently developed genomic platforms may be used to establish more precise clinical correlations and identify specific target genes. we analyzed a series of patients with myeloid disorders using recent genomic technologies (1458 by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays [snp-a], 226 by next-generation sequencing, and 183 by expression microarrays). using snp-a, we identified chromosome 7q loss of heterozygosity segments in 161 of 1458 patients (11%); 26% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients harbored 7q uniparental disomy, of which 41% had a homozygous ezh2 mutation. in addition, we describe an snp-a-isolated deletion 7 hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome subset, with a high rate of progression. using direct and parallel sequencing, we found no recurrent mutations in typically large deletion 7q and monosomy 7 patients. in contrast, we detected a markedly decreased expression of genes included in our snp-a defined minimally deleted regions. although a 2-hit model is present in most patients with 7q uniparental disomy and a myeloproliferative phenotype, haplodeficient expression of defined regions of 7q may underlie pathogenesis in patients with deletions and predominant dysplastic features.
@result combined volumetry and dti in subcortical structures of mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease patients. purpose to compare the regional diffusivity of water in the brains of normally aging elderly people and patients with mild cognitive impairment (mci) or alzheimer disease.   materials and methods magnetic resonance images were obtained in 21 patients with alzheimer disease, 19 patients with mci, and 55 normally aging elderly control subjects without evidence of cognitive impairment. regions of interest were drawn to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) and the anisotropy index (ai) in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior, and posterior cingulate white matter (wm), and the thalami and hippocampi.   results hippocampal adc was higher in mci and alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. adc of the temporal stem and posterior cingulate, occipital, and parietal wm was higher in alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. except for occipital ai, which was lower in mci patients than in control subjects, there were no differences in ai among the three groups for any of the regions.   conclusion hippocampal adc was significantly different between control subjects and mci patients, many of whom likely have preclinical alzheimer disease. elevation in hippocampal adc may reflect early ultrastructural changes in the progression of alzheimer disease.

@method learning to rank question answer pairs with holographic dual lstm architecture matching natural language sentences is central for many applications such as information retrieval and question answering. existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. however, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. to tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (bi-lstm). the matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through $k$-max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. our model has several advantages: (1) by using bi-lstm, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) by matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.
@background repression of shp-1 expression by p53 leads to trka tyrosine phosphorylation and suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation growth factors of the egf family and their respective erbb/her receptor tyrosine kinases underlie many landmarks of tumor cells, including excessive growth, invasive behavior and attraction of blood vessels. enhanced expression of erbb proteins, existence of permanently active receptor mutants and occurrence of autocrine loops are frequently observed in human cancer, and in some cases they associate with poor disease outcome. the four erbb proteins and their 11 ligands act within a layered signaling network coordinated by erbb-2/her2, the most oncogenic family member. drugs that intercept signals emanating from erbb-2 and erbb-1 are already in routine clinical application. here we review three major strategies to develop new erbb-targeted therapies. these are monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antagonists of heat shock protein 90. the underlying mechanisms are critically examined, with an emphasis on potential drug combinations, which hold promise for enhanced clinical efficacy.
@result cardiopulmonary toxicity of peat wildfire particulate matter and the predictive utility of precision cut lung slices an intensive field study was conducted in sumatra, indonesia, during a peat fire episode to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of particulate emissions in peat smoke and to provide necessary data for source-receptor analyses. ambient air sampling was carried out at three different sites located at varying distances from the peatfires to determine changes in mass and number concentrations of pm2.5 and its chemical composition (carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, water-soluble inorganic and organic ions, and total and water-soluble metals). the three sites represent a rural site directly affected by the local peat combustion, a semirural site, and an urban site situated downwind of the peat fires. the mass concentration of pm2.5 and the number concentration of airborne particles were as high as 1600 microg/m3 and 1.7 x 10(5) cm(-3), respectively, in the vicinity of peat fires. the major components of pm2.5 in peat smoke haze were carbonaceous particles, particularly organic carbon, no3-, and so4(2-), while the less abundant constituents included ions such as nh4+, no2-, na+, k+, organic acids, and metals such as al, fe, and ti. source apportionment by chemical mass balance receptor modeling indicates that peat smoke can travel long distances and significantly affect the air quality at locations downwind.
@method relation between parent psychiatric symptoms and youth problems: moderation through family structure and youth gender context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
@background when to stop cpr and when to perform rhythm analysis a study was undertaken to determine the pattern of end-tidal carbon dioxide (etco2) changes during asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest in a pediatric canine model. eleven intubated, anesthetized, paralyzed dogs (mean age, 4.1 mo; mean weight, 5.5 kg) were used. asphyxia was induced by clamping the endotracheal tube (ett) and discontinuing ventilation. cardiac arrest ensued a few minutes later, after which closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and ventilation were initiated. the etco2 level was recorded at baseline and every minute during cpr. mean baseline etco2 was 31.9 mm hg. the initial etco2 immediately after unclamping the ett (mean, 35 mm hg) was higher than subsequent values (mean, 12.4 mm hg; p < .001). there was a sudden increase in etco2 to a mean of 27.0 mm hg at or just before return of spontaneous circulation (rosc) in all 11 cases (p < .01). during cpr, etco2 levels were initially high, decreased to low levels, and increased again at rosc. this pattern, not previously described, is different from that observed in animal and adult cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation, during which etco2 decreases to almost zero after the onset of arrest, begins to increase after the onset of effective cpr, and increases to normal levels at rosc. in this model of asphyxial arrest, continued cardiac output prior to arrest allows continued delivery of co2 to the lungs, resulting in higher alveolar co2; this, in turn, is reflected as increased etco2 once ventilation is resumed during cpr. further study is needed to determine whether the pattern of etco2 changes can be used prospectively to define the etiology of cardiac arrest.
@background red algal mitochondrial genomes are more complete than previously reported over the past several decades, our knowledge of the origin and evolution of mitochondria has been greatly advanced by determination of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. among the most informative mitochondrial genomes have been those of protists (primarily unicellular eukaryotes), some of which harbor the most gene-rich and most eubacteria-like mitochondrial dnas (mtdnas) known. comparison of mtdna sequence data has provided insights into the radically diverse trends in mitochondrial genome evolution exhibited by different phylogenetically coherent groupings of eukaryotes, and has allowed us to pinpoint specific protist relatives of the multicellular eukaryotic lineages (animals, plants, and fungi). this comparative genomics approach has also revealed unique and fascinating aspects of mitochondrial gene expression, highlighting the mitochondrion as an evolutionary playground par excellence.
@background multiple transcriptional mechanisms control ptf1a levels during neural development including autoregulation by the ptf1-j complex ptf1a is an unusual basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factor that is required for the development of the pancreas. we show that early in pancreatic development, active ptf1a requires interaction with rbpj, the vertebrate suppressor of hairless, within a stable trimeric dna-binding complex (ptf1). later, as acinar cell development begins, rbpj is swapped for rbpjl, the constitutively active, pancreas-restricted paralog of rbpj. moreover, the rbpjl gene is a direct target of the ptf1 complex: at the onset of acinar cell development when the rbpjl gene is first induced, a ptf1 complex containing rbpj is bound to the rbpjl promoter. as development proceeds, rbpjl gradually replaces rbpj in the ptf1 complex bound to rbpjl and appears on the binding sites for the complex in the promoters of other acinar-specific genes, including those for the secretory digestive enzymes. a single amino acid change in ptf1a that eliminates its ability to bind rbpj (but does not affect its binding to rbpjl) causes pancreatic development to truncate at an immature stage, without the formation of acini or islets. these results indicate that the interaction between ptf1a and rbpj is required for the early stage of pancreatic growth, morphogenesis, and lineage fate decisions. the defects in pancreatic development phenocopy those of ptf1a-null embryos; thus, the first critical function of ptf1a is in the context of the ptf1 complex containing rbpj. action within an organ-specific transcription factor is a previously unknown function for rbpj and is independent of its role in notch signaling.
@background genotype and expression analysis of two inbred mouse strains and two derived congenic strains suggest that most gene expression is trans regulated and sensitive to genetic background genetical genomics has been proposed to map loci controlling gene-expression differences (eqtls) that might underlie functional trait variation. we briefly review the studies in model species and conclude that, although they successfully demonstrate the utility of genetical genomics, they are too limited to unlock the full potential of this approach and some results should be interpreted with caution. we subsequently elaborate on two recent studies that use this approach in humans. the many differences between these studies complicate meaningful comparisons between them. a joint analysis of the two experiments offers some scope for more powerful genetical genomics.
@method detection and accurate localization of circular fiducials under highly challenging conditions over the last decades fiducial markers have provided widely adopted tools to add reliable model-based features into an otherwise general scene. given their central role in many computer vision tasks, countless different solutions have been proposed in the literature. some designs are focused on the accuracy of the recovered camera pose with respect to the tag; some other concentrate on reaching high detection speed or on recognizing a large number of distinct markers in the scene. in such a crowded area both the researcher and the practitioner are licensed to wonder if there is any need to introduce yet another approach. nevertheless, with this paper, we would like to present a general purpose fiducial marker system that can be deemed to add some valuable features to the pack. specifically, by exploiting the projective properties of a circular set of sizeable dots, we propose a detection algorithm that is highly accurate. further, applying a dot pattern scheme derived from error-correcting codes, allows for robustness with respect to very large occlusions. in addition, the design of the marker itself is flexible enough to accommodate different requirements in terms of pose accuracy and number of patterns. the overall performance of the marker system is evaluated in an extensive experimental section, where a comparison with a well-known baseline technique is presented.
@background associations between individual and combined polymorphisms of the tnf and vegf genes and the embryo implantation rate in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) programs polymorphic variants on chromosomes are considered 'normal', as heterochromatin has no coding potential and nucleolar organizing regions (nor) contain genes coding for rrna. variants have been reported in infertility and recurrent abortions. with refined molecular techniques, genes for fertility and viability are now thought to reside in heterochromatin. dna sequence analysis of human chromosome 9 has shown that it is highly structurally polymorphic, with many intrachromosomal and interchromosomal duplications, and contains the largest autosomal block of heterochromatin. transcriptional activation of constitutive heterochromatic domains of the human genome in response to environmental stress was reported recently. heat shock triggers the assembly of nuclear stress bodies on the pericentromeric heterochromatin of human chromosomes including chromosome 9. these are characterized by an epigenetic status typical of euchromatic regions. on acrocentric chromosomes, nor-associated protein count and morphology was reported to separate benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. hence all variants may not be 'normal'. the present study of karyotyping 842 individuals attending an ivf clinic with primary infertility or repeated miscarriages, showed polymorphic variants in 28.82% of males and 17.19% of females, which was quite high. it is suggested that variants should not be ignored by cytogeneticists. screening prospective gamete donors for chromosome variants may help enhance the success of ivf.

@method the role of parallel signaling pathways in maintaining lymphoid cell survival to gain further insight into the role of raf-1 in normal cell growth, c-raf-1 mrna expression, raf-1 protein production, and raf-1-associated kinase activity in normal human t cells were analyzed. in contrast to the constitutive expression of raf-1 in continuously proliferating cell lines, c-raf-1 mrna and raf-1 protein levels were barely detectable in freshly isolated g0 t lymphocytes. previous work with fibroblasts has suggested that raf-1 plays a signaling role in the g0-g1 phase transition. in t cells, triggering via the t-cell antigen receptor (tcr)-cd3 complex (tcr/cd3) resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in c-raf-1 mrna. in addition, the promotion of g1 progression by interleukin 2 (il-2) was associated with a 5- to 10-fold immediate/early induction of c-raf-1 mrna, resulting in up to a 12-fold increase in raf-1 protein expression. tcr/cd3 activation did not alter the phosphorylation state of raf-1, whereas interleukin 2 receptor stimulation resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of a subpopulation of raf-1 molecules progressively increasing throughout g1. these findings were complemented by assays for raf-1-associated kinase activity which revealed a gradual accumulation of serine and threonine autokinase activity in raf-1 immunoprecipitates during g1, which remained elevated throughout dna replication.
@background oral tolerance inhibits pulmonary eosinophilia in a cockroach allergen induced model of asthma: a randomized laboratory study several cytokines derived from th3 and tr1 cells, including il-10, are believed to regulate oral tolerance, but direct evidence is lacking. we have explored the potential role of il-10 by generating transgenic (tg) mice with sustained hepatocyte-specific expression of rat il-10. tg mice expressed rat il-10 downstream of a transthyretin promoter, which led to serum levels that were increased 10- to 100-fold compared with normal animals. animals were orally administered 1 mg of whole ova for 5 consecutive days, with control animals receiving pbs. there were six animal groups: either ova or pbs were fed orally to rat il-10 tg mice, non-tg wild-type mice without il-10 administration, and non-tg wild-type mice administered rat il-10 systemically. on day 8, all mice were immunized with two injections of ova, and then analyzed on day 18. t cell proliferation responses were reduced by 65.8 ± 14.3% after feeding of ova in ril-10 tg animals, compared with 39.4 ± 15.6% in the non-tg mice (p = 0.02). anti-ova titers were expressed as fold increase over naive non-tg mice. after feeding, titers decreased by ∼33% (from 3- to 2-fold) in tg animals and, to a lesser extent, in non-tg animals. ifn-γ secretion by cultured popliteal lymphocytes decreased in tg animals by 83% after feeding and by 69% in non-tg animals. il-4 secretion increased 4-fold in tg-fed mice, but did not significantly change in non-tg ova-fed animals. in contrast to hepatic tg expression of ril-10, systemic administration of ril-10 had only a modest effect on tolerance. il-10, when transgenically expressed in the liver enhances mucosal tolerance to an oral ag.
@method the effects of water velocity on the ceratomyxa shasta infectious cycle. myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite responsible for whirling disease in salmonid fishes, has a complex life-cycle involving an invertebrate host and 2 spore stages. water flow rate is an environmental variable thought to affect the establishment and propagation of m. cerebralis; however, experimental data that separates flow effects from those of other variables are scarce. to compare how this parameter affected parasite infection dynamics and the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, dead, infected fish were introduced into a naive habitat with susceptible hosts under 2 experimental flow regimes: slow (0 x 02 cm/s) and fast (2 x 0 cm/s). throughout the 1-year study, uninfected fry were held in both systems, the outflows were screened weekly for spores and the annelid populations were monitored. we found clear differences in prevalence of infection in the worms, prevalence and severity of infection in the fish, and host survival. both flows provided environments in which m. cerebralis could complete its life-cycle; however, both the parasite and its invertebrate host proliferated to a greater extent in the slow flow environment over the 1-year study period. this finding is of significance for aquatic systems where the flow rate can be manipulated, and should be incorporated into risk analysis assessments.
@background clinical commentary with video sequences gelastic seizures : not always hypothalamic hamartoma an unusual microscopic abnormality has been identified in the lobectomy specimens removed surgically from the brains of 10 epileptic patients. the abnormality could seldom be identified by palpation or with the naked eye. histologically, it consisted of congregations of large, bizarre neurones which were littered through all but the first cortical layer. in most, but not in all cases, grotesque cells, probably of glial origin, were also present in the depths of the affected cortex and in the subjacent white matter. this kind of abnormality appears to be a malformation. the picture is reminiscent of tuberous sclerosis but too many distinguishing features, both in the clinical and in the pathological aspects, make this diagnosis untenable. the cases are therefore looked on provisionally (since all but one are still alive) as comprising a distinct form of cortical dysplasia in which localized, exotic populations of nerve cells underlie the electrical and clinical manifestations of certain focal forms of epilepsy.
@background the argonaute10 gene modulates shoot apical meristem maintenance and establishment of leaf polarity by repressing mir165/166 in arabidopsis. in higher plants, class i knotted1-like homeobox (knox) gene suppression and leaf polarity establishment are two processes crucial for leaf morphogenesis. the arabidopsis genes, asymmetric leaves1 and 2 (as1 and as2), are required for repressing the class i knox genes and promoting leaf adaxial cell fates. in addition, the rna-dependent rna polymerase6 (rdr6) gene acts synergistically with as1 and as2 to specify the adaxial polarity and repress the knox genes in leaves. it is known that rdr6 is one of the key components in plant post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs), and is likely to function with other silencing components in a genetic pathway in regulating leaf patterning. here we report phenotypic analyses of double mutants combining as1 or as2 with other mutations relating to different rna silencing pathways. we show that plants carrying rdr6, suppressor of gene silencing3 (sgs3) or zippy (zip, also called ago7) in combination with as1 or as2 demonstrate severe morphological defects, and the double mutant plants are generally similar to one another. detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses reveal that leaves of rdr6 as2(1), sgs3 as2(1) and zip as2(1) all show an abnormal adaxial identity, and contain high levels of microrna165/166 and filamentous flower (fil) transcripts. these results suggest that rdr6, sgs3 and ago7 act in the same pathway, which genetically interacts with the as1-as2 pathway for leaf development. the rdr6-sgs3-ago7 pathway was previously identified as regulating the plant vegetative phase change. our results reveal a new function of the pathway, which is also required for normal leaf morphogenesis.

@result incidence of tooth loss in adults: a 4-year population-based prospective cohort study objective to assess the relative contribution of caries and periodontal disease to tooth loss over 24 years in a cohort deprived of regular dental care.   material & methods the study population consisted of 98 subjects from a tea estate on west java, indonesia, that had been part of a prospective longitudinal study and provided full datasets of clinical assessments between 1987, 1994 and 2002. in 2011, complete sets of dental radiographs were made which was combined with the survey forms and clinical slides from the previous assessments in order to estimate reasons for tooth loss.   results thirty-seven subjects lost no teeth, whereas 61 subjects lost 185 teeth. in this group, 45.9% lost ≤2 teeth, 32.8% lost 3 to 4 teeth and 19.7% lost ≥5 teeth. the majority of teeth were lost due to caries. in five subjects, tooth loss could be attributed solely to periodontitis, whereas in four subjects teeth were lost due to both caries and periodontits. analyses of the predictor variables age, gender, smoking, education, presence of caries and severe periodontitis showed that male gender and caries were significantly associated with tooth loss.   conclusion the majority of teeth in this population were lost due to caries.

@result nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a south european population: epidemiological data and clinical aspects in portugal information concerning the descriptive and analytical epidemiology of npc that has been reported mainly since the first international symposium on the subject in singapore in 1964 are reviewed. npc is rare in most countries in the world, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of less than 1 per 100,000, and the incidence rate is twice as high in males as in females. chinese of southern origin have a uniquely high risk, the incidence rates per 100,000 being 10--20 in males and 5--10 in females. the greater the admixture of southern chinese blood in a given ethnic group, the more likely it is that the npc incidence rate in that group will be raised. the incidence in both sexes begins to rise after the ages of 20--24 and reaches a plateau at between 45 and 54. when the logarithm of mortality and morbidity is plotted against the logarithm of the age, the power of the age that provides the best fit to a straight line on a log-log graph is approximately two to four. these figures are lower than for other cancers. seroepidemiological case-control studies indicate that both different birthplace and abnormal response to ebv antigen significantly enhance the risk for npc; when these two factors are combined, the relative risk appears to rise further. the effect of other environmental chemicals, such as from cigarette smoking, shown to be significant in several retrospective studies, could explain in part epidemiological phenomena such as sex difference in incidence. the definitive reason for the uniquely high risk in southern chinese should be further investigated by taking into account the interactions of host factors (birthplace, hla, etc.) and environmental factors (ebv, chemical carcinogens including nitrosamines, excessive intake of salted fish, nutritional deficiencies, etc.).
@background skewed x-chromosome inactivation in human miscarriages imprinted inactivation of the paternal x chromosome in marsupials is the primordial mechanism of dosage compensation for x-linked genes between females and males in therians. in eutherian mammals, x chromosome inactivation (xci) evolved into a random process in cells from the embryo proper, where either the maternal or paternal x can be inactivated. however, species like mouse and bovine maintained imprinted xci exclusively in extraembryonic tissues. the existence of imprinted xci in humans remains controversial, with studies based on the analyses of only one or two x-linked genes in different extraembryonic tissues. here we readdress this issue in human term placenta by performing a robust analysis of allele-specific expression of 22 x-linked genes, including xist, using 27 snps in transcribed regions. we show that xci is random in human placenta, and that this organ is arranged in relatively large patches of cells with either maternal or paternal inactive x. in addition, this analysis indicated heterogeneous maintenance of gene silencing along the inactive x, which combined with the extensive mosaicism found in placenta, can explain the lack of agreement among previous studies. our results illustrate the differences of xci mechanism between humans and mice, and highlight the importance of addressing the issue of imprinted xci in other species in order to understand the evolution of dosage compensation in placental mammals.
@background involvement of tlr2 in recognition of acute gammaherpesvirus-68 infection neutrophils are involved in the initial host response to influenza a virus (iav) infection and exhibit both activation and depressed function after exposure to the virus. we demonstrate that iav causes rapid upregulation of toll‐like receptor 2 (tlr2) expression on neutrophils. the neutrophil agonists, formyl‐methylpleucyl‐alanine (fmlp), c5a and lipopolysaccharide did not alter neutrophil tlr2 expression, whereas pma and the microbial tlr2 ligands, peptidoglycan (pgn) and zymosan, reduced it. to determine the functional significance of iav‐induced increase in tlr2 expression, iav‐treated neutrophils were exposed to pgn, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and zymosan. pretreatment with iav resulted in significantly increased uptake of s. aureus and zymosan and accelerated neutrophil apoptosis when combined with s. aureus. iav‐treated cells generated significantly more h2o2 in response to pgn. these results indicate that iav increases neutrophil surface expression of tlr2 and modulates functional responses to ligands that bind tlr2. these findings may clarify iav‐induced perturbation of neutrophil functions in vivo.
@method age-dependent regression analysis of male gonadal axis. pulsatile and thus total testosterone (te) secretion declines in older men, albeit for unknown reasons. analytical models forecast that aging may reduce the capability of endogenous luteinizing hormone (lh) pulses to stimulate leydig cell steroidogenesis. this notion has been difficult to test experimentally. the present study used graded doses of a selective gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh)-receptor antagonist to yield four distinct strata of pulsatile lh release in each of 18 healthy men ages 23-72 yr. deconvolution analysis was applied to frequently sampled lh and te concentration time series to quantitate pulsatile te secretion over a 16-h interval. log-linear regression was used to relate pulsatile lh secretion to attendant pulsatile te secretion (lh-te drive) across the four stepwise interventions in each subject. linear regression of the 18 individual estimates of lh-te feedforward dose-response slopes on age disclosed a strongly negative relationship (r = -0.721, p < 0.001). accordingly, the present data support the thesis that aging in healthy men attenuates amplitude-dependent lh drive of burst-like te secretion. the experimental strategy of graded suppression of neuroglandular outflow may have utility in estimating dose-response adaptations in other endocrine systems.
@method proteome analysis of streptococcus mutans metabolic phenotype during acid tolerance. a plaque growth chamber was developed for long-term growth of five separate plaques from the same plaque or saliva sample under identical conditions of temperature and gas phase. reagent addition and growth conditions for each plaque could be independently controlled, and each was accessible for sequential sampling and electrode insertion. plaques were cultured for over six weeks on pellicle-coated lux (tm) 25-mm diameter cover-slips at 35°c under 5% co2 in n 2, and supplied with a medium containing 0.25% mucin (bmm) at 3.6 ml/h, and with periodic 5% sucrose. electron microscopy and flora analysis of microcosm plaques showed that they had close similarities to reported characteristics of natural dental plaques. diverse motile bacteria were present. sucrose-induced stephan ph curves and urea-induced ph rises were also similar to those reported for natural plaques. changes in plaque urease, calcium, phosphate concentrations, and the flora were followed over five weeks in a plaque supplied with bmm containing additional 2.5 mmol/l calcium and 7.5 mmol/l phosphate. despite this high environmental calcium phosphate concentration, there was no continuing increase in calcium levels, although plaque phosphate doubled. urease levels fluctuated. changes in the cultivable flora were minor. a urea-containing calcium phosphate/ mono-fluorophosphate ph 5 solution, applied for six min every two h for seven days, increased plaque calcium, phosphate, and fluoride to high levels. thus, plaques grown over several weeks in the multi-station artificial mouth exhibited metabolic and ph behavior typical of natural plaques, could be analyzed during development, and the system allowed manipulation of environmental variables important in plaque ph control and calcification.
@method genome-wide associations between genetic and epigenetic variation influence mrna expression and insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets type 1 diabetes (t1d) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. we report the findings of a genome-wide association study of t1d, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. the total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with t1d in the meta-analysis (p < 10−6). after excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (asp) families. of these, 18 regions were replicated (p < 0.01; overall p < 5 × 10−8) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (p < 0.05). the many new candidate genes suggested by these results include il10, il19, il20, glis3, cd69 and il27.

@method fuzzy geographically weighted clustering using artificial bee colony: an efficient geo-demographic analysis algorithm and applications to the analysis of crime behavior in population geographic information systems (gis) play a very important role to researches and industries. in fact, there have been some studies related to the development of this kind of systems as well as methods of mining attribute gis data. in this paper, we will explore an aspect of data mining in gis, that is, gis clustering for geo-demographic analysis and present a novel context-based fuzzy geographically weighted clustering algorithm to solve such task.
@background mechanisms underlying the transformation of disparity signals from v1 to v2 in the macaque one of the fundamental challenges of binocular vision is that objects project to different positions on the two retinas (binocular disparity). neurons in visual cortex show two distinct types of tuning to disparity, position and phase disparity, which are the results of differences in receptive field location and profile, respectively. here, we point out that phase disparity does not occur in natural images. why, then, should the brain encode it? we propose that phase-disparity detectors help to work out which feature in the left eye corresponds to a given feature in the right. this correspondence problem is plagued by false matches: regions of the image that look similar, but do not correspond to the same object. we show that phase-disparity neurons tend to be more strongly activated by false matches. thus, they may act as 'lie detectors', enabling the true correspondence to be deduced by a process of elimination.
@background laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: the learning curve of a low volume surgeon background we previously reported the learning curve for open radical prostatectomy, reporting large decreases in recurrence rates with increasing surgeon experience. here we aim to characterise the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.   methods we did a retrospective cohort study of 4702 patients with prostate cancer treated laparoscopically by one of 29 surgeons from seven institutions in europe and north america between january, 1998, and june, 2007. multivariable models were used to assess the association between surgeon experience at the time of each patient's operation and prostate-cancer recurrence, with adjustment for established predictors.   findings after adjusting for case mix, greater surgeon experience was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (p=0.0053). the 5-year risk of recurrence decreased from 17% to 16% to 9% for a patient treated by a surgeon with 10, 250, and 750 prior laparoscopic procedures, respectively (risk difference between 10 and 750 procedures 8.0%, 95% ci 4.4-12.0). the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was slower than the previously reported learning curve for open surgery (p<0.001). surgeons with previous experience of open radical prostatectomy had significantly poorer results than those whose first operation was laparoscopic (risk difference 12.3%, 95% ci 8.8-15.7).   interpretation increasing surgical experience is associated with substantial reductions in cancer recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, but improvements in outcome seem to accrue more slowly than for open surgery. laparoscopic radical prostatectomy seems to involve skills that do not translate well from open radical prostatectomy.   funding national cancer institute, the allbritton fund, and the david j koch foundation.
@method saps 3 score as a predictive factor for postoperative referral to intensive care unit objectiverisk adjustment systems now in use were developed more than a decade ago and lack prognostic performance. objective of the saps 3 study was to collect data about risk factors and outcomes in a heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit (icu) patients, in order to develop a new, improved model for risk adjustment.designprospective multicentre, multinational cohort study.patients and settinga total of 19,577 patients consecutively admitted to 307 icus from 14 october to 15 december 2002.measurements and resultsdata were collected at icu admission, on days 1, 2 and 3, and the last day of the icu stay. data included sociodemographics, chronic conditions, diagnostic information, physiological derangement at icu admission, number and severity of organ dysfunctions, length of icu and hospital stay, and vital status at icu and hospital discharge. data reliability was tested with use of kappa statistics and intraclass-correlation coefficients, which were >0.85 for the majority of variables. completeness of the data was also satisfactory, with 1 [0–3] saps ii parameter missing per patient. prognostic performance of the saps ii was poor, with significant differences between observed and expected mortality rates for the overall cohort and four (of seven) defined regions, and poor calibration for most tested subgroups.conclusionsthe saps 3 study was able to provide a high-quality multinational database, reflecting heterogeneity of current icu case-mix and typology. the poor performance of saps ii in this cohort underscores the need for development of a new risk adjustment system for critically ill patients.
@result tnf-alpha -induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression is cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase dependent. the present study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that multiple oxygen radical generating systems contribute to the tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha-stimulated transcriptional activation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (vcam)-1 in endothelial cells. experimental evidence has implicated the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase and a phagocyte type nadph-oxidase as a source of oxygen radicals in these cells. we show here that endothelial cells exhibit cytochrome p450 activity by measuring the o-dealkylation of the exogenous substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin, but components of the phagocyte-type nadph oxidase could not be demonstrated in endothelial cells. in that latter respect it was surprising that the nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin completely prevented the accumulation of vcam-1 mrna. however, we found that apocynin also acts as an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 activity in endothelial cells. therefore the inhibitory effect of apocynin on the induction of vcam-1 may no longer be used to demonstrate a role for the nadph oxidase in this process. furthermore, different cytochrome p450 inhibitors co2+, metyrapone, skf525a decreased the endothelial vcam-1 expression stimulated by tnfalpha. also under hypoxic conditions the expression of vcam-1 was reduced. on this basis we assume that the oxygen dependent step in the intracellular signalling cascade underlying the tnfalpha stimulated transcriptional activation of vcam-1 resides in the activity of a cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase. the finding that the phospholipase a2 inhibitor bromophenacylbromide inhibited the expression of vcam-1 may indicate that arachidonic acid serves as a substrate for the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase reaction, but further research is needed to elucidate the particular cytochrome p450 family member mediating the expression of vcam-1.
@background minimally invasive plate fixation of the tibia objective to describe the extraosseous blood supply of the tibia and how the blood supply of the distal tibia is influenced by different plating techniques. design microdissection of cadaveric adult hip disarticulation specimens following sequential arterial injections of india ink and ward's blue latex was performed. readily identifiable arterioles measured approximately 0.5 mm in diameter. their artery of origin was identified, and their position along the medial, lateral, and posterior aspects of the tibia was documented relative to the tibial plafond. additionally, six matched pairs of limbs were used to assess the effects of different plating techniques on the extraosseous blood supply along the medial aspect of the distal tibia. setting university anatomy laboratory. patients/participants nine matched pairs (n = 18) of randomly obtained, adult cadaveric hip disarticulation specimens. intervention india ink followed by ward's blue latex was injected into the superficial femoral artery at the level of the inguinal crease after cleansing of the arterial system. the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles were dissected from the leg, exposing the arterial system and the extraosseous vessels of the tibia. mean outcome measurements the extraosseous blood supply of each aspect of the tibial diaphysis was determined. each extraosseous arteriole was identified, and the locations of each documented relative to the tibial plafond. changes in the filling of these vessels along the medial aspect of the distal tibia were documented in a separate group of specimens (n = 12), which had undergone two different plating techniques. results the proximal metaphysis of the tibia was found to have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily from vessels from the popliteal artery, the anterior tibial artery (ata) laterally, and the posterior tibial artery (pta) medially. in comparison, the tibial diaphysis was found to have relatively few extraosseous vessels and a considerably hypovascular region, posteriorly. branches of the ata were found to supply the posterior aspect of the diaphysis with these branches passing through the interosseous membrane. the diaphysis also received a variable contribution from the pta. the lateral aspect of the diaphysis was supplied by branches of the ata. an anastomotic network of arteries from the ata and pta formed the rich extraosseous blood supply of the medial distal aspect of the tibia. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a statistically significant (p < 0.05) greater disruption of the extraosseous blood supply of the metaphyseal region than did percutaneously applied plates. in each specimen, open plating prevented filling of each periosteal vessel in the region as opposed to percutaneous plates, which permitted filling of the extraosseous vessels up to the edge of the plate. conclusions the proximal and distal metaphyseal areas of the tibia have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily by branches of the ata and the pta. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a greater disruption of this extraosseous blood supply than did percutaneously applied plates. disruption of these extraosseous vessels following fracture and subsequent operative stabilization may slow healing and increase the risk of delayed union and nonunion. these findings support current efforts to develop less invasive methods and implants for operative stabilization of distal tibia fractures.
@method information extraction in the web era written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning. since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed at different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still presents major difficulties. a statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.
@background the antimicrobial triclocarban stimulates embryo production in the freshwater mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum. the antimicrobial compound triclocarban (tcc; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide; cas# 101-20-2) is a high-production-volume chemical, recently suggested to cause widespread contamination of us water resources. to test this hypothesis, we developed an isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method for ultratrace analysis of tcc (0.9 ng/l detection limit) and analyzed low-volume water samples (200 ml) along with primary sludge samples from across the united states. all river water samples (100%) collected downstream of wastewater treatment plants had detectable levels of tcc, as compared to 56% of those taken upstream. concentrations of tcc (mean+/-standard deviation) downstream of sewage treatment plants (84+/-110 ng/l) were significantly higher (p<0.05; wilcoxon rank sum test) than those of samples taken upstream (12+/-15 ng/l). compared to surface water, mean tcc concentrations found in dried, primary sludge obtained from municipal sewage treatment plants in five states were six orders of magnitude greater (19,300+/-7100 microg/kg). several river samples contained a co-contaminant, identified based on its chromatographic retention time, molecular base ion, and ms/ms fragmentation behavior as 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (dcc; cas# 1219-99-4). in addition to tcc and dcc, municipal sludge contained a second co-contaminant, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (tetracc; cas# 4300-43-0). both newly detected compounds were present as impurities (0.2%(w/w) each) in technical grade tcc (99%). application of the new method for chlorocarbanilide analysis yielded tcc occurrence data for 13 us states, confirmed the role of sewage treatment plants as environmental inputs of tcc, and identified dcc and tetracc as previously unrecognized pollutants released into the environment alongside tcc.
@method machine learning and non-negative compressive sampling the new emerging theory of compressive sampling has demonstrated that by exploiting the structure of a signal, it is possible to sample a signal below the nyquist rate and achieve perfect reconstruction. in this short note, we employ non-negative matrix factorisation in the context of compressive sampling and propose two nmf algorithms for signal recovery—one of which utilises iteratively reweighted least squares. the algorithms are applied to compressively sampled non-negative data, where a sparse non-negative basis and corresponding non-negative coefficients for the original uncompressed data are discovered directly in the compressively sampled domain.
@background a cardioprotective role for platelet-activating factor through nos-dependent s-nitrosylation. nitric oxide (no) can directly modulate cardiac contractility by accelerating relaxation and reducing diastolic tone. the intracellular mechanisms underlying these contractile effects are poorly understood. here we investigate the role of cyclic gmp‐dependent protein kinase (pkg) in the contractile response to exogenous no in rat ventricular myocytes. isolated ventricular myocytes were stimulated electrically and contractility was assessed by measuring cell shortening. some cells were loaded with the fluorescent ca2+ probe indo‐1 am for simultaneous assessment of the intracellular ca2+ transient. the no donor diethylamine nonoate (dea/no, 10 μm) significantly increased resting cell length, reduced twitch amplitude and accelerated time to 50 % relaxation (to 100.8 ± 0.2, 83.7 ± 3.0 and 88.9 ± 3.7 % of control values, respectively). the contractile effects of dea/no occurred without significant changes in the amplitude or kinetics of the intracellular ca2+ transient, suggesting that the myofilament response to ca2+ was reduced. these effects were abolished by inhibition of either guanylyl cyclase (with 1h‐[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3‐a]quinoxalin‐1‐one; odq, 10 μm) or pkg (with rp‐8‐br‐cgmps, 10 μm) suggesting that, at the concentration investigated, the effects of dea/no were mediated exclusively by pkg, following activation of guanylyl cyclase and elevation of cgmp. direct activation of pkg with 8‐pcpt‐cgmp (10 μm) mimicked the effects of dea/no (resting cell length and time to 50 % relaxation were 100.6 ± 0.1 and 90.5 ± 1.5 % of control values, respectively).the reduced myofilament ca2+ responsiveness was not attributable to an intracellular acidosis since the small reduction in phi induced by dea/no was found to be uncoupled from its contractile effects. however, hearts treated with dea/no (10 μm) showed a significant increase (1.4‐fold; p < 0.01) in troponin i phosphorylation compared to control, untreated hearts. these results suggest that the reduction in myofilament ca2+ responsiveness produced by dea/no results from phosphorylation of troponin i by pkg.
@background acute hemodynamic effects of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibition after prolonged cardiac arrest with bretschneider’s solution background angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) produces angiotensin ii, causing vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and reduction of coronary blood flow. the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an ace inhibitor increases coronary blood flow and improves myocardial metabolic and contractile functions of ischemic myocardium.   methods and results in 65 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. when cilazaprilat (3 micrograms/kg per minute) was infused into the bypass tube for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow due to partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow increased from 30 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute despite there being no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (43 +/- 1 mm hg). the ratio of myocardial endocardial flow to epicardial flow increased during an infusion of cilazaprilat. both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were increased (fractional shortening: 4.1 +/- 0.6% to 8.9 +/- 0.6%, p < .001; lactate extraction ratio: -55.7 +/- 3.3% to -36.7 +/- 3.9%, p < .001). during an infusion of cilazaprilat, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood was markedly increased. the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was attenuated by hoe-140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors; coronary blood flow: 35 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute), and by n omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; coronary blood flow: 34 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute). intracoronary administration of bradykinin mimicked the beneficial effects of cilazaprilat. cyclic gmp content of the coronary artery was increased by cilazaprilat compared with the untreated condition in the ischemic myocardium. in the denervated hearts, the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was not attenuated. on the other hand, cv11974, an inhibitor of angiotensin ii receptors, slightly increased coronary blood flow to 34 +/- 2 from 30 +/- 1 ml/100 g per minute.   conclusions we conclude that an inhibitor of ace can increase coronary blood flow and ameliorate myocardial ischemia, primarily due to accumulation of bradykinin and production of nitric oxide from the ischemic myocardium. inhibition of angiotensin ii production due to inhibition of ace partially contributes to coronary vasodilation in the ischemic myocardium.
@method application of metabolomics to study effects of bariatric surgery chronological age is one of the most important risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. still, two individuals at the same chronological age could have different biological aging states, leading to different individual risk profiles. capturing this individual variance could constitute an even more powerful predictor enhancing prediction in age-related morbidity. applying a nonlinear regression technique, we constructed a metabonomic measurement for biological age, the metabolic age score, based on urine data measured via (1)h nmr spectroscopy. we validated the score in two large independent population-based samples by revealing its significant associations with chronological age and age-related clinical phenotypes as well as its independent predictive value for survival over approximately 13 years of follow-up. furthermore, the metabolic age score was prognostic for weight loss in a sample of individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. we conclude that the metabolic age score is an informative measurement of biological age with possible applications in personalized medicine.
@method a tabletop interface using controllable transparency glass for collaborative card-based creative activity in this paper we present artoolkitplus, a successor to the popular artoolkit pose tracking library. artoolkitplus has been optimized and extended for the usage on mobile devices such as smartphones, pdas and ultra mobile pcs (umpcs). we explain the need and specific requirements of pose tracking on mobile devices and how we met those requirements. to prove the applicability we performed an extensive benchmark series on a broad range of off-the-shelf handhelds.
@background histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
@result polar localization of a dihydropyridine receptor on living fucus zygotes. abstract using an ultrasensitive extracellular vibrating electrode, i have studied the membrane-generated electrical currents around the egg of the brown alga, pelvetia, between fertilization and germination. during this period, the egg chooses an elongation axis and moves wall-precursor vesicles to the prospective growth region where they are secreted. this results in visible ooplasmic segregation which appears under the light microscope as a 1- to 2-μm-thick clear band at the cortex of the growth region. a steady electrical current enters a small region of the membrane and leaves the remainder of the egg's surface as early as 30 min after fertilization. this early spatial current pattern is unstable and shifts position, often with more than one inward current region. however, current enters mainly on the side where germination will occur and is usually largest at the prospective cortical clearing region. the average measured early current density is 0.06 μa/cm2 at 50 μm from the egg's surface, implying a surface current density of between 0.2 and 1 μa/cm2 due to the extrapolation uncertainty. at germination the current increases about twofold, resulting in a total transcellular current on the order of 100 pa. unilateral growth-orienting light reversal stimulates inward current on the new dark side, and subsequent morphological polarity reversal is preceded by electrical polarity reversal. the steady current tends to increase when the external ca2+ concentration is increased or the external na+ concentration is decreased, suggesting that the current is carried in part by ca2+. this current will generate a transcellular electrical field which may be the force driving the observed ooplasmic segregation.
@background evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.

@method a best-worst scaling survey of adolescents' level of concern for health and non-health consequences of smoking. background: one of the greatest difficulties in evaluating healthcare system reform in any country is that governments often do not clearly articulate what it is they are attempting to do. in australia, a recent inquiry set out 15 principles to guide the reform process, but it remains unclear how the australian public values the principles, how such values vary across the country, and, more fundamentally, if australians understand the principles.objectives: to evaluate the australian healthcare reform principles from the perspective of the australian public, to test if such preferences are valued consistently across geographic and socioeconomic strata, and to test for the degree of understanding of the principles among the public.methods: we employed best-worst scaling (bws), a stated-preference method grounded in random utility theory, to elicit public preference for 15 healthcare reform principles. the bws tasks were incorporated into an online survey that also gathered geographic and socioeconomic information and included questions relating to the understanding of the reform principles. respondents were a geographically diverse set of australians who were randomized to receive one of two versions of the survey, each containing a block of 15 choice tasks. tasks in block one contained a subset of the choice tasks containing subsets of seven principles based on a balanced incomplete block design, while tasks in block two contained tasks with eight principles defined by the complement of the former.in each bws task, respondents were simply asked to identify the most and least important principle. analysis of preference was based on assigning the most valued principles a ‘1’ and the least valued principles ‘−1’, and with each item appearing eight times in each block, preferences were analyzed over a cardinal utility scale bounded by −8 and +8. analysis was based on simple summary statistics and stratified by geographic and socioeconomic measures.results: a sample of 204 respondents participated in the survey (a participation rate of 85%). quality and safety was the most important principle and a culture of reflective improvement and innovation was the least important. public voice and community engagement was the second least important principle and was also understood by barely half the respondents.conclusions: this research demonstrates how random-utility-based methods can be used to provide estimates of the importance of reform principles that have known statistical properties. the bws task used forced respondents to discriminate between the principles on offer, unlike rating scales. researchers and practitioners in healthcare should consider using bws tasks in preference to rating scales.
@method calculating pulmonary-mode-lethality risk avoidance associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures related to a radiological terrorism incident this paper provides theoretical health-risk-assessment tools that are designed to facilitate planning for and managing radiological terrorism incidents that involve ingestion exposure to bone-seeking radionuclides (e.g., radiostrontium nuclides). the focus is on evaluating lethality risk avoidance (rav; i.e., the decrease in risk) that is associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures employed to remove ingested bone-seeking beta and/or gamma-emitting radionuclides from the body. to illustrate the application of tools presented, hypothetical radiostrontium decorporation scenarios were considered that involved evaluating the hematopoietic-mode-lethality rav. for evaluating the efficacy of specific decorporation countermeasures, the lethality risk avoidance proportion (rap; which is the rav divided by the total lethality risk in the absence of protective countermeasures) is introduced. the lethality rap is expected to be a useful tool for designing optimal radionuclide decorporation schemes and for identifying green, yellow and red dose-rate zones. for the green zone, essentially all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided (rap = 1) as a consequence of the radionuclide decorporation scheme used. for the yellow zone, some but not all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided. for the red zone, none of the lethality risk (which equals 1) is expected to be avoided.
@method stream-packing: resource allocation in web server farms with a qos guarantee statistical sharing over several timescales is a key feature of the internet, and is likely to be an essential aspect of future atm networks. in this chapter we describe how usage-sensitive pricing can encourage statistical sharing, and we provide a quantitative framework for the discussion of pricing issues in systems where statistical sharing is important. in particular we describe a simple charging and accounting mechanism for real-time bursty connections, based on the concept of an eeective bandwidth. the mechanism performs the dual role of conveying information to the network that allows more eecient statistical sharing, and information to the user about the resource implications of diierently policed connection requests. the resulting tarii takes a strikingly simple form: a charge a(x) per unit time, a charge b(x) per unit volume of traac carried, and a charge c(x) per connection, where the triple (a(x); b(x); c(x)) are xed at the time of connection acceptance as a function of the connection contract x. this form of tarii is also able to reveal user preferences concerning delay tolerant traac, and thus promises to provide a uniied pricing model over a wide range of quality of service classes.
@background incidence and risk factors of injuries in brazilian elite handball players: a prospective cohort study overuse injuries may represent as much of a problem as do acute injuries in many sports. this paper reviews key concepts related to the methodology for recording overuse symptoms. results from the fivb volleyball injury study were used to compare two different recording methods. the aim of this paper was to provide recommendations on how standardised methodology can be developed to quantify overuse injuries in surveillance studies. using beach volleyball data, a “traditional” cohort study approach using a time-loss injury definition suggested that injury risk was very low. in contrast, the data from a survey of past and present pain problems in the shoulder, knees and low back demonstrated that these were prevalent. the following recommendations are made: (1) studies should be prospective, with continuous or serial measurements of symptoms; (2) valid and sensitive scoring instruments need to be developed to measure pain and other relevant symptoms; (3) prevalence and not incidence should be used to report injury risk; (4) severity should be measured based on functional level and not time loss from sports. in conclusion, new approaches are needed to develop more appropriate methodology to quantify overuse injuries in studies.
@background a probabilistic eulerian approach for motion planning of a large-scale swarm of robots swarm robotics is an approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized behaviors of social animals. through simple rules and local interactions, swarm robotics aims at designing robust, scalable, and flexible collective behaviors for the coordination of large numbers of robots. in this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. we propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. we conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.
@result identification of a putative pathway for the muscle homing of stem cells in a muscular dystrophy model the protein product of the human duchenne muscular dystrophy locus (dmd) and its mouse homolog (mdmd) have been identified by using polyclonal antibodies directed against fusion proteins containing two distinct regions of the mdmd cdna. the dmd protein is shown to be approximately 400 kd and to represent approximately 0.002% of total striated muscle protein. this protein is also detected in smooth muscle (stomach). muscle tissue isolated from both dmd-affected boys and mdx mice contained no detectable dmd protein, suggesting that these genetic disorders are homologous. since mdx mice present no obvious clinical abnormalities, the identification of the mdx mouse as an animal model for dmd has important implications with regard to the etiology of the lethal dmd phenotype. we have named the protein dystrophin because of its identification via the isolation of the duchenne muscular dystrophy locus.
@method microemulsion based gel for topical dermal delivery of pseudolaric acid b: in vitro and in vivo evaluation. the objective was to develop a ternary skin targeting system for ketoconazole (ket) using a combined strategy of microemulsion (me) and cyclodextrin (hp-β-cd), i.e., ket-cd-me, which exploits both virtues of cyclodextrin complex and me to obtain the synergetic effect. ket-cd-me was formulated using labrafil m 1944 cs as oil phase, solutol hs 15 as surfactant, transcutol p as cosurfactant, and hp-β-cd solution as aqueous phase. the formulation of ket-cd-me was optimized and the optimal formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, ph value, and viscosity. long term stability experiment showed that hp-β-cd could increase the physical stability of ternary system and ket chemical stability. percutaneous permeation of ket from ket-cd-me in vitro through rat skin was investigated in comparison with ket microemulsion (ket-me), ket hp-β-cd inclusion solution (ket-cd), ket aqueous suspension, and commercial ket cream; the results showed that the combination of me with hp-β-cd exhibited significantly synergistic effect on ket deposition within the skin (29.38 ± 1.79 μg/cm(2)) and a slightly synergistic effect on ket penetration through the skin (11.3 μg/cm(2)/h). the enhancement of the combination on skin deposition was further visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm). in vitro sensitivity against candida parapsilosis test indicated that ket-cd-me enhanced ket antifungal activity mainly owing to the solubilization of hp-β-cd on ket in the ternary system. moreover, the interactions between hp-β-cd and ket in the ternary system were elucidated through microscale thermophoresis (mst) and 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the profiles from mst confirmed the host-guest interactions of hp-β-cd with ket in the ternary system and a deep insight into the interactions between ket and hp-β-cd were obtained by means of 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the results indicate that the ternary system of me combination with hp-β-cd may be a promising approach for skin targeting delivery of ket.
@method gonadal differentiation and temperature effects on sex determination in the freshwater pike silverside chirostoma estor jordan 1880 elevated water temperature has been found to cause gonadal degeneration in fish, including the partial or complete loss of germinal elements, and might impair fertility and reproductive performance. germ cell–deficient and even completely sterile pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis have been found in two lagoons in argentina, and exposure to warm water is one of the possible causes of these abnormalities. this experiment was conducted (a) to compare the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads from wild pejerrey with those of animals exposed to heat in the laboratory and (b) to examine whether short‐term pulses of heat similar to diurnal temperature variations in natural environments during summer can trigger gonadal cell degeneration in adult pejerrey. wild fish with gonadal abnormalities were obtained from the san miguel del monte and lacombe lagoons (buenos aires province, argentina). laboratory specimens were obtained by exposure of adult pejerrey to five thermal regimes (constant 24° and 29°c and 12‐h cycles of 27°–31°, 28°–30°, and 28°–31°c) for up to 16 wk. germ cell–deficient specimens for histological comparison with wild animals were also obtained by exposing larvae and juveniles for 8–12 wk to 29°c and rearing until they became adults. the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads of wild pejerrey closely resembled those of fish partially or completely sterilized by high water temperature in the laboratory. the results indicate that fluctuating (high) thermal regimes triggered germ cell disappearance in a manner comparable to a constant temperature of 29°c. these results support the notion that high temperature during unusually warm summers might trigger germ cell degeneration and could be the cause of the observed gonadal abnormalities in wild pejerrey.
@background a multi-threading architecture to support interactive visual exploration simvis is a novel technology for the interactive visual analysis of large and complex flow data which results from computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation. the new technology which has been researched and developed over the last years at the vrvis research center in vienna, introduces a new approach for interactive graphical exploration and analysis of time-dependent data (computed on large three-dimensional grids, and resulting in a multitude of different scalar/vector values for each cell of these grids). in this paper the major new technological concepts of the simvis approach are presented and real-world application examples are given.
@background biotic and abiotic degradation of pesticide dufulin in soils pentachlorophenol (pcp) contamination is a severe environmental problem due to its widespread occurrence, toxicity and recalcitrance. in order to gain a better understanding of the fate of pcp in soils, the role of the soil organic matter (som) and clay minerals in the pcp sorption-desorption was studied on two bulk field soils, two subsoils (i.e., som or clay-removed soil) and two artificial soils. the two field soils used were a silty loam from new mexico (nm) containing 10% clay and a sandy-clay-loam from colombia (co) south america comprised of 18% clay minerals. the bulk co soil containing kaolinite sorbed significantly less pcp than the nm soil. all soils depicted an apparent hysteresis during sorption. the co bulk and subsoils desorbed 14-20% and 15-26% of the sorbed pcp respectively whereas the nm bulk and subsoils desorbed only 4-12% and 5-16%, respectively. experiments conducted with pure clay and artificial soils indicated that the expandable clay minerals were key sorbent material. additional studies to investigate the interaction between som and clay minerals are needed to fully understand sorptive phenomena.
@method novel serum proteomic signatures in a non-human primate model of retinal injury purpose ureteropelvic junction obstruction may either worsen and require surgery, improve or remain stable. it may take upward of 3 years for the natural history to unfold. urinary proteome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry has been shown to differentiate between normal infants and those with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. we sought to confirm these findings using liquid chromatography/nano-spray mass spectrometry to examine the urinary proteome in patients with unilateral grade iv ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched healthy infants.   materials and methods urine specimens were obtained from 21 healthy infants with normal maternal/fetal ultrasound and 25 infants with grade iv unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. specimens were prepared using standard methods and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. normalized data were annotated using the ipa(r) knowledge platform.   results there were 31 proteins significantly different in their level of abundance at 1 to 6 months, and 18 at 7 to 12 months compared to age matched controls. these proteins clustered into major functional networks. all of the biomarkers previously reported in clinical studies of ureteropelvic junction obstruction were observed with the notable exception of transforming growth factor-beta1.   conclusions these results confirm the presence of significant differences in the urinary proteome in unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched normal individuals. this study adds new information about levels of abundance of specific proteins and peptides in ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which may allow for better classification of disease subgroups and help to establish improved indications for the early selection of surgical candidates based on urinary protein biomarkers.
@background hemostatic potential of latex proteases from tabernaemontana divaricata (l.) r. br. ex. roem. and schult. and artocarpus altilis (parkinson ex. f.a. zorn) forsberg latex glycoprotein (lgp) from synadenium grantii latex was purified by the combination of heat precipitation and gel permeation chromatography. lgp is a heat stable protein even at 80 degrees c showed a sharp single band both in sds-page as well as in native (acidic) page. lgp is a monomeric protein appears as single band under reducing condition. it is a less hydrophobic protein showed sharp single peak in rp-hplc with retention time of 13.3 m. the relative molecular mass of lgp is 34.4 kda. cd spectrum of lgp explains less content of alpha-helix (7%), and high content of beta-pleated sheets (48%) and random coils (46%). the n-terminal sequence of lgp is d-f-p-s-d-w-y-a-y-e-g-y-v-i-d-r-p-f-s. purified lgp is a fibrinogen degrading protease hydrolyses all the three subunits in the order of aalpha, bbeta and gamma. the hydrolytic pattern is totally different from plasmin as well as thrombin. lgp reduces recalcification time from 165 to 30 s with citrated human plasma but did not show thrombin like as well as factor xa-like activity. although lgp induces procoagulant activity, it hydrolyses partially cross-linked fibrin clot. it hydrolyses all the subunits of partially cross-linked fibrin clot (alpha- chains, beta-chain and gamma-gamma dimer). lgp is a serine protease, inhibited by pmsf. other serine protease inhibitors, aprotinin and leupeptin did not inhibit the caseinolytic activity as well as fibrinogenolytic activity. we report purification and characterization of a glycoprotein from synadenium grantii latex with human fibrino(geno)lytic activity.
@result knowledge about the relation between tobacco and disease and the attitude toward advising the cessation of its consumption among a group of spanish dental students background ireland has some of the strictest smoking regulations in the world. little is known of the attitudes of student irish dental healthcare workers towards tobacco control and tobacco use cessation. this study aimed at determining the knowledge and attitudes of these students towards the deleterious effects of tobacco in the mouth and towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice.   method a questionnaire survey was distributed to 654 students (including newly qualified) on dentistry, dental hygiene and dental nursing programmes in irish dental schools. information sought included college, course, year of study, sex, age, nationality, smoking status, knowledge of effects of tobacco in the mouth and attitudes towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice and towards the irish smoking bans.   main findings there was a 90% response rate. in all, 12% of dental students, 25% of dental hygiene students and 31% of dental nursing students were current smokers. newly qualified dental hygienists were as knowledgeable about tobacco effects in the mouth as newly qualified dentists. overall, the majority in each student category believed that all three groups could be effective tobacco counsellors and should provide tobacco use cessation counselling to patients, although less than half of evening course dental nursing students felt that dental nurses could be effective counsellors or should provide counselling. there was overwhelming support for the irish smoking ban. only a minority of dental students and dental nursing students had received instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.   conclusions there are strong positive attitudes to tobacco use cessation counselling in dental practice among these young dental healthcare students. this is true even amongst those who have not received specific instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.
@background executive function in high-functioning autism: decision-making consistency as a characteristic gambling behaviour the emotional responses elicited by the way options are framed often results in lack of logical consistency in human decision making. in this study, we investigated subjects with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using a financial task in which the monetary prospects were presented as either loss or gain. we report both behavioral evidence that asd subjects show a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect and psycho-physiological evidence that they fail to incorporate emotional context into the decision-making process. on this basis, we suggest that this insensitivity to contextual frame, although enhancing choice consistency in asd, may also underpin core deficits in this disorder. these data highlight both benefits and costs arising from multiple decision processes in human cognition.
@background identification and biochemical characterization of adenylate kinase 1 from clonorchis sinensis the hydrogenosomal enzyme atp:amp phosphotransferase (adenylate kinase) (ec 2.7.4.3) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the bovine parasite tritrichomonas foetus. a fraction enriched for hydrogenosomes was obtained from cell homogenates which had been subjected to differential and isopycnic centrifugation. adenylate kinase was solubilized in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.3, containing 0.8% triton x-100, and purified by sequential affi-gel blue affinity chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. the purified enzyme, a monomer of mr 29,000, exhibited km values of 100, 195, and 83 microm for adp, atp, and amp, respectively. substituting other mono-, di-, and trinucleotides for amp, adp, and atp gave less than half the maximal activity. full enzyme activity requires mg2+, but mn2+ and co2+ yield half maximal activity. the enzyme has a broad optimal ph range between ph 6 and 9. the enzyme was competitively inhibited by p1,p5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate, a specific adenylate kinase inhibitor: the ki was 150 nm. the enzyme was also inhibited with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and this inhibition could be reversed by the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol. t. foetus adenylate kinase has similar catalytic and physical properties to that of the biologically closely related human parasite trichomonas vaginalis.
@method comparative study of trace elements in blood, scalp hair and nails of prostate cancer patients in relation to healthy donors background gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer which is predominantly associated with the environmental factors. the carcinogenic processes are linked with the imbalances of trace metals in body fluid and tissues.   methods trace metals (cd, cr, cu, fe, ni, pb and zn) are estimated in blood plasma and scalp hair of the cancer patients and controls employing nitric acid-perchloric acid based wet-digestion followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method.   results the mean concentrations of cd, cr, cu and ni were found to be significantly higher in the plasma of patients compared with the controls, however, appreciably higher concentrations of fe and zn were observed in the plasma of controls. the average scalp hair concentrations of zn, fe, pb, cu and cd were notably higher in the patients than controls. the correlation study revealed significantly different mutual variations of the trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls. the apportionment of trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls was also considerably different.   conclusions the study revealed that the carcinogenic processes are significantly affecting the trace metal burden and mutual variations in the cancerous patients compared with the controls.
@background computational models with thermodynamic and composition features improve sirna design the crystal structure based model of the catalytic center of ago2 revealed that the sirna and the mrna must be able to form an a-helix for correct positing of the scissile phosphate bond for cleavage in rnai. this suggests that base pairing of the target mrna with itself, i.e. secondary structure, must be removed before cleavage. early on in the sirna design, gc-rich target sites were avoided because of their potential to be involved in strong secondary structure. it is still unclear how important a factor mrna secondary structure is in rnai. however, it has been established that a difference in the thermostability of the ends of an sirna duplex dictate which strand is loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex. here, we use a novel secondary structure prediction method and duplex-end differential calculations to investigate the importance of a secondary structure in the sirna design. we found that the differential duplex-end stabilities alone account for functional prediction of 60% of the 80 sirna sites examined, and that secondary structure predictions improve the prediction of site efficacy. a total of 80% of the non-functional sites can be eliminated using secondary structure predictions and duplex-end differential.

@background expression of the opioid growth factor-opioid growth factor receptor axis in human ovarian cancer. opioid growth factor (ogf) is an endogenous pentapeptide that inhibits growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in culture, as well as xenografts in nude mice. to establish the maximum tolerated dose (mtd), and determine safety and toxicity of ogf, a phase i trial was performed in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with escalating doses of ogf for 30 min i.v. to determine the mtd. the s.c. route of administration also was evaluated. once the mtd was established, a group of patients was treated chronically, and monitored for safety and toxicity. hypotension was the dose-limiting toxicity, resulting in a mtd of 250 μg/kg i.v. due to limited solubility of ogf in small volumes, a maximum dose of 50 μg/kg twice daily was determined by the s.c. route of administration. no adverse events were reported for oxygen saturation, cardiac rhythm, laboratory values or neurological status in either the acute or chronic parts of the study with the i.v. or s.c. routes. during the chronic i.v. phase, two subjects had resolution of liver metastases and one showed regression of the pancreatic tumor. mean survival from the time of diagnosis was 8.7 months (range 2–23 months) in the i.v. group and 9.5 months (range 1–18 months) in the s.c. group. we conclude that ogf can be safely administered to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of ogf alone or in combination with present modes of therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
@background retina homozygosity for a recessive loss-of-function mutation of the nrl gene is associated with a variant of enhanced scone syndrome purpose at lower stimulus intensities, the amplitude of the photopic flash erg b-wave increases with increasing stimulus intensities, but then plateaus and decreases at higher stimulus intensities (the "photopic hill"). the purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism underlying this unusual phenomenon.   methods five adult monkeys (macaca mulatta and m. fascicularis) were studied. stimuli were obtained from xenon strobe flashes, and the intensity was reduced by neutral-density filters in 0.4-log unit steps. n-methyl-d-aspartic acid and tetrodotoxin citrate (nmda+ttx) were used to suppress inner retinal activities and l-2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (apb) and cis-2,3 piperidine dicarboxylic acid (pda) to block postreceptoral on- and off-pathway activities. the postsynaptic on- and off-components were isolated by subtracting the postdrug ergs from the predrug ergs.   results the intensity-response curve of the photopic b-wave obtained after the intravitreal injection of ttx+nmda had the same shape as a photopic hill, suggesting that the contribution from the inner retinal neurons to the photopic hill is not significant. at low and intermediate intensities, the photopic b-wave was mainly shaped by the overlapping of two positive peaks from the on- and off-components. however, the amplitude of the positive peak from the on-component became smaller and broader at higher stimulus intensities. in addition, the timing of the positive peak of the off-component was gradually delayed with increasing intensities. after apb+pda, the remaining cone photoreceptor component contributed only to the negative a-wave at all stimulus intensities.   conclusions the photopic hill in the primate erg results mainly from two factors: the reduction of the on-component amplitude at higher intensities and the delay in the positive peak of the off-component at higher intensities.
@background ceacam1, an adhesion molecule of human granulocytes, is fucosylated by fucosyltransferase ix and interacts with dc-sign of dendritic cells via lewis x residues. both the dendritic cell receptor dc-sign and the closely related endothelial cell receptor dc-signr bind human immunodeficiency virus and enhance infection. however, biochemical and structural comparison of these receptors now reveals that they have very different physiological functions. by screening an extensive glycan array, we demonstrated that dc-sign and dc-signr have distinct ligand-binding properties. our structural and mutagenesis data explain how both receptors bind high-mannose oligosaccharides on enveloped viruses and why only dc-sign binds blood group antigens, including those present on microorganisms. dc-sign mediates endocytosis, trafficking as a recycling receptor and releasing ligand at endosomal ph, whereas dc-signr does not release ligand at low ph or mediate endocytosis. thus, whereas dc-sign has dual ligand-binding properties and functions both in adhesion and in endocytosis of pathogens, dc-signr binds a restricted set of ligands and has only the properties of an adhesion receptor.

@background kv1.3 channels regulate synaptic transmission in the nucleus of solitary tract. the active and passive membrane properties of rabbit nodose ganglion cells and their responsiveness to depolarizing agents have been examined in vitro. neurons with an axonal conduction velocity of less than 3 m/s were classified as c-cells and the remainder as a-cells. mean axonal conduction velocities of a- and c-cells were 16.4 m/s and 0.99 m/s, respectively. a-cells had action potentials of brief duration (1.16 ms), high rate of rise (385 v/s), an overshoot of 23 mv, and relatively high spike following frequency (sff). c-cells typically had action potentials with a "humped" configuration (duration 2.51 ms), lower rate of rise (255 v/s), an overshoot of 28.6 mv, an after potential of longer duration than a-cells, and relatively low sff. eight of 15 a-cells whose axons conducted at less than 10 m/s had action potentials of longer duration with a humped configuration; these were termed ah-cells. they formed about 10% of cells whose axons conducted above 2.5 m/s. the soma action potential of a-cells was blocked by tetrodotoxin (ttx), but that of 6/11 c-cells was unaffected by ttx. typically, a-cells showed strong delayed (outward) rectification on passage of depolarizing current through the soma membrane and time-dependent (inward) rectification on inward current passage. input resistance was thus highly sensitive to membrane potential close to rest. in c-cells, delayed rectification was not marked, and slight time-dependent rectification occurred in only 3 of 25 cells; i/v curves were normally linear over the range: resting potential to 40 mv more negative. data on ah-cells were incomplete, but in our sample of eight cells time-dependent rectification was absent or mild. c-cells had a higher input resistance and a higher neuronal capacitance than a-cells. in a proportion of a-cells, rn was low at resting potential (5 m omega) but increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized by a few millivolts. a-cells were depolarized by gaba but were normally unaffected by 5-ht or dmpp. c-cells were depolarized by gaba in a similar manner to a-cells but also responded strongly to 5-ht; 53/66 gave a depolarizing response, and 3/66, a hyperpolarizing response. of c-cells, 75% gave a depolarizing response to dmpp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

@method training quantized nets: a deeper understanding groups at mit and nyu have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. it is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. we show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. a second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. we created two sets of reliable labels. the cifar-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the cifar-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.
@background plasma apolipoprotein vldl-ii and egg production in laying hens: establishment of an elisa method. at onset of egg-laying in the chicken, plasma levels of apolipoprotein vldl-ii (apoii) increase dramatically, suggesting a function of apoii in yolk deposition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. thus, the possibility that this female-specific homodimeric protein (mr of subunit, 9500) is recognized by the oocyte receptor for low and very low density lipoproteins was investigated. apoii was purified from very low density lipoproteins by a novel, rapid procedure and reconstituted with egg phosphatidylcholine (pc) by detergent-dialysis. the resulting discoidal apoii/pc lipoprotein particles contained 3 mg of apoii per mg of pc and had a buoyant density of 1.062 g/ml. the ability of apoii/pc, as well as of physiological particles containing apoii but devoid of apolipoprotein b (apob), namely high density lipoproteins (hdl) from laying hens, to interact with the oocyte receptor was tested. both of these ligands failed to show saturable high affinity binding, in contrast to the apob-containing ligands, low and very low density lipoproteins. furthermore, neither laying-hen hdl which contain apoii and apoa-i nor apoii/pc were able to displace receptor-bound apob-containing lipoproteins, as shown in competitive binding assays as well as by ligand blotting. thus, we conclude that apob, but not apoii, participates in binding and uptake of very low density lipoproteins via receptor-mediated endocytosis by growing chicken oocytes.
@background genomic and gene-expression comparisons among phage-resistant type-iv pilus mutants of pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola the genome of the lipid-containing bacteriophage phi 6 contains three segments of double-stranded rna. we have determined the nucleotide sequence of cdna derived from the middle-size rna segment. the coding sequences of three proteins on this segment were identified on the basis of size and the correlation of predicted n-terminal amino acid sequences with those found through the analysis of isolated proteins. in contrast to our results with the small phi 6 dsrna segment, the open reading frames are not tightly clustered. the homologous terminal noncoding regions between the middle and small dsrna segments are found to be more extensive than rna sequencing had previously indicated.
@result effects of restricted feeding of prepubertal ewe lambs on growth performance and mammary gland development. the effects of rapid weight gain to puberty on reproduction, mammary development and milk production in ewes lambing at 13 mo of age were investigated on three trials. a total of 64 dorset and 93 suffolk ewe lambs were weaned at 42 d of age and their mean weight was 16 kg. these ewes were assigned, within breed groups, to either a finishing diet or a growing diet. onset of puberty was determined by daily checks for estrus and ewes were bred beginning at 7 mo of age. in trial 2, mammary gland development was determined in eight suffolk ewes from each diet. ewes on the finishing diet were younger at puberty than those on the growing diet (199 vs 206 d, p<0.05) but required more services per conception (1.3 vs 1.1, p<0.05). dietary conception rate and lambing rate means were similar. mean 4-h milk yield was lower (p<0.10) for ewes on the finishing diet (283 g) than for those on the growing diet (310 g). mammary gland fat pad area was higher (p<0.05) for ewes on the finishing diet compared with those fed for growth. gross and adjusted duct areas were higher in ewes on the growing diet, but differences were not significant. at puberty, negative correlation coefficients for milk yield with performance traits were as follows: daily weight gain, -0.184 (p<0.08); weight-to-height ratio -0.262 (p<0.01); body condition score, -0.189 (p<0.07); and body weight, -0.212 (p<0.05). results of this study indicate that rapid weight gain to puberty impairs mammary gland development and milk production in ewe lambs.
@method high normal fasting glucose level in obese youth: a marker for insulin resistance and beta cell dysregulation given the extreme increase in prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and the potential for metabolic syndrome in obese youth, identifying simplified indexes for assessing stimulated insulin sensitivity is critical. the purpose of this study was validation of two surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity determined from the oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): the composite whole body insulin sensitivity index (wbisi) and the insulin sensitivity index (isi). an obese population (aged 8-18 yr) of normal and impaired glucose tolerance individuals was studied. one group (n = 38) performed both the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and ogtt for comparison of insulin sensitivity measurements as well as (1)h-magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimates of intramyocellular lipid content. another larger (n = 368) cohort participated only in an ogtt. both the wbisi and isi represented good estimates (r = 0.78 and 0.74; p < 0.0005) for clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (glucose disposed, m-value), respectively. in the large cohort, the surrogate indexes demonstrated the shift toward poorer function and increased risk profile as a function of insulin resistance. additionally, the wbisi and isi correlated with intramyocellular lipid content (r = -0.74 and -0.71; p < 0.0001), a tissue marker for insulin resistance. insulin sensitivity can be estimated using plasma glucose and insulin responses derived from the ogtt in obese youth with normal and impaired glucose tolerance.
@method empirical datasets for energies journal article 'from theory to econometrics to energy policy: cautionary tales for policymaking using aggregate production functions' national exergy efficiency analysis relates the quality of primary energy inputs to an economy with end useful work in sectoral energy uses such as transport, heat and electrical devices. this approach has been used by a range of authors to explore insights to macroscale energy systems and linkages with economic growth. however, these analyses use a variety of calculation methods with sometimes coarse assumptions, inhibiting comparisons. therefore, building on previous studies, this paper first contributes toward a common useful work accounting framework, by developing more refined methodological techniques for electricity end use and transport exergy efficiencies. second, to test this more consistent and granular approach, these advances are applied to the us and uk for 1960 to 2010. the results reveal divergent aggregate exergy efficiencies: us efficiency remains stable at around 11%, while uk efficiency rises from 9% to 15%. the us efficiency stagnation is due to "efficiency dilution", where structural shifts to lower efficiency consumption (e.g., air-conditioning) outweigh device-level efficiency gains. the results demonstrate this is an important area of research, with consequent implications for national energy efficiency policies.
@background visualizing changes in cdkn1c expression links early-life adversity to imprint mis-regulation in adults monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is generally associated with differential methylation. methylation may be inherited as the gametic imprinting mark or may be acquired postfertilization. here, we characterize a differentially methylated region associated with the mouse cdkn1c gene and find that it is confined to a cpg island that begins 600 bp 5' of the promoter and extends into the transcription unit. our analysis indicates that methylation of this region is not inherited from sperm, is acquired specifically on the paternal allele following implantation, and is dependent on kvdmr1. we further demonstrate that although methylation is required for maintaining silencing of the paternal cdkn1c allele, it is not a prerequisite for the establishment of monoallelic expression at this locus. prior to the onset of differential methylation, additional epigenetic modifications must play a role in distinguishing the parental alleles of cdkn1c and influencing their expression.
@method a prospective randomized trial of content expertise versus process expertise in small group teaching purpose: to examine an instrument for evaluating clinical teaching using factor analysis and to refine the validated instrument to a practical length. method: factor analysis on a split sample of 1,581 student evaluations rating 178 teachers. the instrument was based on the seven-category stanford faculty development program's (sfdp's) clinical teaching framework and contained 58 likert-scaled items, with at least seven items per category plus five items measuring “teacher's knowledge.” standard methodology for survey item reduction was used to remove items with low or complex factor loadings and iteratively remove items with low item-scale correlation. results were replicated on the second sample. results: the seven original categories emerged and items originally categorized under “knowledge” statistically combined with “promoting self-directed learning.” over 73% of the variance was explained. item reduction resulted in 25 items with overall internal consistency over .97 and internal consistency of constructs ranging from .82 to .95. conclusions: factor analysis of student ratings validated the seven-category sfdp framework. an abbreviated instrument to measure the seven categories is described. results suggest that students may not systematically distinguish between their teachers' knowledge and their teachers' ability to promote self-directed learning, an important finding for both administrators and faculty development programs.
@background smad2 and 3 transcription factors control muscle mass in adulthood. myostatin is a transforming growth factor-β family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. to identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the n-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of c-terminal fragments. the purified c-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type ii receptors, act riib and, to a lesser extent, act riia. binding of myostatin to act riib could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. to determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of act riib by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.
@method a new species of andinobates (amphibia: anura: dendrobatidae) from west central panama. the poison frogs of the colombian andes, pacific lowlands and panama have been recently recognized as a new, monophyletic and well-supported genus: andinobates. the species richness and distribution within andinobates remain poorly understood due to the paucity of geographic, genetic and phenotypic data. here we use a combination of molecular, bioacoustic and morphometric evidence to describe a new species of andean poison frog: andinobates cassidyhornae sp. nov. from the high elevation cloud forests of the colombian cordillera occidental, in the northwestern andes. the new species is associated to the bombetes group and characterized by a unique combination of ventral and dorsal color patterns. data on 1119 bp from two mitochondrial markers allowed us to reject the null hypotheses that a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. is part of the phenotypically similar and geographically less distant species: a. opisthomelas, a. virolinensis or a. bombetes. the best available phylogenetic trees and the genetic distance to other andinobates species further support this decision. altogether, the advertisement call parameters unambiguously separated a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. calls from the calls of the three closest species. the new species adds to a poorly known and highly endangered genus of poison frogs that requires further studies and urgent conservation measures.
@background intrapair birthweight discordance in twins. objective to challenge the hypothesis that discordant growth is a normal variation by relating birth weight discordance to total twin birth weight. method among 12,565 israeli live-born twin pairs (1993–98), we compared total twin birth weight decile, the frequencies of three levels of discordance in the general population, over 25% discordance between like- versus unlike-sex pairs, and over 25% discordance between pairs delivered by primiparas versus multiparas. results we found a marked change in the best-fit correlation function with increased discordance: level 15–24.9% was inversely linear whereas levels 25–34.9% and over 34.9% were inversely logarithmic (r2 = .47, .88, and .9, respectively). the best-fit correlation of frequencies of more than 25% discordance was inversely logarithmic and similar in like-and unlike-sexed twins across deciles functions (p = .7, odds ratio [or] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.9, 1.2). the overall frequencies of discordance were also similar (9.3% versus 10.2%, p = .11, or 0.9, 95% ci 0.8, 1.0). the frequencies of primiparas decreased linearly (r2 = .98) and the frequencies of more than 25% discordant pairs in multiparas and primiparas across the deciles had similar inversely logarithmic patterns (p = .55, or 1.0, 95% ci 0.9, 1.2). discordance over 25% was significantly more frequent among primiparas (p < .001, or 1.45, 95% ci 1.3, 1.6). conclusion the observed patterns of birth weight discordance did not substantiate normal variation but an adaptive growth restriction that might explain why the likelihood of discordant growth decreases as total twin birth weight increases.
@method silencing smoc2 ameliorates kidney fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation. research on fibroblast biology in three-dimensional collagen matrices offers new opportunities to understand the reciprocal and adaptive interactions that occur between cells and surrounding matrix in a tissue-like environment. such interactions are integral to the regulation of connective tissue morphogenesis and dynamics that characterizes tissue homeostasis and wound repair. during fibroblast-collagen matrix remodeling, mechanical signals from the remodeled matrix feed back to modulate cell behavior in an iterative process. as mechanical loading (tension) within the matrix increases, the mechanisms used by cells to remodel the matrix change. fibroblasts in matrices that are under tension or relaxed respond differently to growth factor stimulation, and switching between mechanically loaded and unloaded conditions influences whether cells acquire proliferative/biosynthetic active or quiescent/resting phenotypes.
@background energy intake from human milk covers the requirement of 6-month-old senegalese exclusively breast-fed infants objective: to measure the lipid content and the fatty acid (fa) composition of breast milk as part of a nutritional survey of the essential fatty acid (efa) status of 5 months old congolese infants.design: cross sectional nutrition survey.setting: a suburban district of brazzaville (capital of the congo).subjects: a random sample of nursing mothers and their 5 months old infants (n=102).data collection procedures: the mothers were questionned on their socio-economic status, dietary habits, and their body mass index (bmi) was measured. breast milk samples were collected from each mother. milk lipid content and fatty acid composition were determined.results: compared with milk from various countries, congolese women's mature breast milk was low in lipid (28.70±11.33 g/l) but rich in 8:0–14:0 fas (25.97±8.17% of total fas) and in polyunsaturated fas (pufas), particularly n-3 pufas (2.39±0.68% of total fas, mainly 18:3 and 22:6). this was associated with the frequent consumption of high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread, doughnuts) known to enhance 8:0–14:0 fa biosynthesis, and with that of foods providing n-6 and n-3 efas such as freshwater and saltwater fish, vegetable oil, green leafy vegetables, and high-fat fruit (peanuts, avocado, bushbutter). these foods were traditionally and locally produced. milk lipid content was negatively related with mothers' bmi (p<0.01) and varied with the frequency of consumption of certain foods corresponding to distinct dietary patterns.conclusions: lipid content and fa composition of congolese breast milk were dependent on mother's nutritional status. however, despite an adequate efa composition of breast milk, partially breast-fed 5 months old congolese infants probably did not get enough n-6 and n-3 efas from breast milk to meet their efa requirements.sponsorship: supported in part by the french ministry of research (contract no. 92.l.0728) and inra (institut national de la recherche agronomique).
@background a novel inhibitor of smad-dependent transcriptional activation suppresses tissue fibrosis in mouse models of systemic sclerosis. smads regulate transcription of defined genes in response to tgf-beta receptor activation, although the mechanisms of smad-mediated transcription are not well understood. we demonstrate that the tgf-beta-inducible smad3 uses the tumor suppressor smad4/dpc4 and cbp/p300 as transcriptional coactivators, which associate with smad3 in response to tgf-beta. the association of cbp with smad3 was localized to the carboxyl terminus of smad3, which is required for transcriptional activation, and a defined segment in cbp. furthermore, cbp/p300 stimulated both tgf-beta- and smad-induced transcription in a smad4/dpc4-dependent fashion. smad3 transactivation and tgf-beta-induced transcription were inhibited by expressing e1a, which interferes with cbp functions. the coactivator functions and physical interactions of smad4 and cbp/p300 with smad3 allow a model for the induction of gene expression in response to tgf-beta.
@background raffinose family oligosaccharides act as galactose stores in seeds and are required for rapid germination of arabidopsis in the dark phytochrome interacting factor 3-like5 (pil5) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that inhibits seed germination by regulating the expression of gibberellin (ga)- and abscisic acid (aba)-related genes either directly or indirectly. it is not yet known, however, whether pil5 regulates seed germination solely through ga and aba. here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip (chip-chip) analysis to identify 748 novel pil5 binding sites in the arabidopsis thaliana genome. consistent with the molecular function of pil5 as a transcription regulator, most of the identified binding sites are located in gene promoter regions. binding site analysis shows that pil5 binds to its target sites mainly through the g-box motif in vivo. microarray analysis reveals that phytochromes regulate a large number of genes mainly through pil5 during seed germination. comparison between the chip-chip and microarray data indicates that pil5 regulates 166 genes by directly binding to their promoters. many of the identified genes encode transcription regulators involved in hormone signaling, while some encode enzymes involved in cell wall modification. interestingly, pil5 directly regulates many transcription regulators of hormone signaling and indirectly regulates many genes involved in hormone metabolism. taken together, our data indicate that pil5 inhibits seed germination not just through ga and aba, but also by coordinating hormone signals and modulating cell wall properties in imbibed seeds.
@result distribution of primary immunodeficiency disorders diagnosed in the children's medical center in iran. background advances in immunologic techniques in recent years have led to increased recognition of primary immunodeficiency disorders, with iga deficiency the most common phenotype reported by most registries. there have also been reports of increased associated incidence of autoimmunity, allergy, and other diseases.   objectives we wished to determine the percentage of different primary immunodeficiency disorders seen in a pediatric tertiary hospital and to determine the association of primary immunodeficiency disorders with other diseases that are not part of classic immunodeficiency disorders.   methods we performed a retrospective review of the patients referred to our allergy/immunology clinic for immunologic evaluation of recurrent infections during an 8-year period. we also reviewed pathology reports with postmortem diagnosis of immunodeficiencies not identified while patients were alive.   results of the 91 patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders evaluated, the majority had predominantly antibody deficiencies (67%). the most common phenotype was specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins (23.1%), defined as inability to mount an adequate response to pneumococcal polysaccharides followed by igg2 subclass deficiency (17.6%). these two phenotypes were diagnosed mostly in the last 2 years of the survey. associated diseases, found in 40% of patients, were mostly allergic conditions followed by syndromic/chromosomal disorders.   conclusion the study reveals that specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins followed by igg2 subclass deficiency was the most frequently diagnosed primary immunodeficiency disorder in our patient population. it also indicates that immunodeficiency disorders should be considered in patients with other abnormalities like allergic and syndromic/chromosomal disorders that present with recurrent infections.
@method anemia and performance status as prognostic markers in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the early warning score (ews) is a simple physiological scoring system suitable for bedside application. the ability of a modified early warning score (mews) to identify medical patients at risk of catastrophic deterioration in a busy clinical area was investigated. in a prospective cohort study, we applied mews to patients admitted to the 56-bed acute medical admissions unit (mau) of a district general hospital (dgh). data on 709 medical emergency admissions were collected during march 2000. main outcome measures were death, intensive care unit (icu) admission, high dependency unit (hdu) admission, cardiac arrest, survival and hospital discharge at 60 days. scores of 5 or more were associated with increased risk of death (or 5.4, 95%ci 2.8-10.7), icu admission (or 10.9, 95%ci 2.2-55.6) and hdu admission (or 3.3, 95%ci 1.2-9.2). mews can be applied easily in a dgh medical admission unit, and identifies patients at risk of deterioration who require increased levels of care in the hdu or icu. a clinical pathway could be created, using nurse practitioners and/or critical care physicians, to respond to high scores and intervene with appropriate changes in clinical management.
@background rasip1 is essential to blood vessel stability and angiogenic blood vessel growth ras proteins are small gtpases that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. components of the ras signaling pathway have been shown to be important during embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. here, we report that rasip1, which encodes a novel ras-interacting protein, is strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells throughout development, in both mouse and frog. similar to the well-characterized vascular markers vegfr2 and pecam, rasip1 is specifically expressed in angioblasts prior to vessel formation, in the initial embryonic vascular plexus, in the growing blood vessels during angiogenesis and in the endothelium of mature blood vessels into the postnatal period. rasip1 expression is undetectable in vegfr2 null embryos, which lack endothelial cells, suggesting that rasip1 is endothelial specific. sirna-mediated reduction of rasip1 severely impairs angiogenesis and motility in endothelial cell cultures, and morpholino knockdown experiments in frog embryos demonstrate that rasip1 is required for embryonic vessel formation in vivo. together, these data identify rasip1 as a novel endothelial factor that plays an essential role in vascular development.
@method sparsity-based no-reference image quality assessment for automatic denoising sharpness is an important determinant in visual assessment of image quality. the human visual system is able to effortlessly detect blur and evaluate sharpness of visual images, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. existing blur/sharpness evaluation algorithms are mostly based on edge width, local gradient, or energy reduction of global/local high frequency content. here we understand the subject from a different perspective, where sharpness is identified as strong local phase coherence (lpc) near distinctive image features evaluated in the complex wavelet transform domain. previous lpc computation is restricted to be applied to complex coefficients spread in three consecutive dyadic scales in the scale-space. here we propose a flexible framework that allows for lpc computation in arbitrary fractional scales. we then develop a new sharpness assessment algorithm without referencing the original image. we use four subject-rated publicly available image databases to test the proposed algorithm, which demonstrates competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.
@background a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
@background importance of binocular vision in foot placement accuracy when stepping onto a floor-based target during gait initiation in comparison to lateral judgments of distance, stereoscopic judgments are not precise. although stereoacuity thresholds for targets presented in the fixation plane can equal the best thresholds for the monocular hyperacuities, i.e. a few sec arc, the increment thresholds for disparity are substantially larger than the increment thresholds for lateral separation (width). we measured the minimum detectable change in the three-dimensional distance separating two features, one presented in the fixation plane, and the other some distance in front of it, i.e. with a significant standing disparity between the two features. for briefly-presented targets (150 msec), the weber fraction for disparity was 10-20% over the range from 1 to 20 min arc, while the weber fraction for width was only 2-3% under comparable conditions. the disparity thresholds were substantially improved for a longer duration target (1000 msec), but they were still a factor of two worse than the monocular width thresholds. in a related experiment, the vernier acuity for a standard vernier target was profoundly degraded by pairing the offset upper line presented to one eye with a disparate line in the other eye; the vernier threshold was elevated for disparities ranging from 3 to 30 min arc. this finding shows that the more precise monocular signals are actively suppressed in fused or partially-fused stereoscopic images.
@result deepproblog: neural probabilistic logic programming given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. in this paper, we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge for neural networks, such as knowing how a program should traverse a sequence, but not what local actions should be performed at each step. to this end, we present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language forth which enables programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. we can optimise this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user-specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. we show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex behaviours such as sequence sorting and addition. when connected to outputs of an lstm and trained jointly, our interpreter achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for end-to-end reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language stories.
@background risk associations of melanoma in a southern european population: results of a case/control study different pigmentary characteristics as well as different parameters of sun exposure have previously been identified as risk factors for developing cutaneous melanoma. the aim of the present study was to identify significant risk factors, determine the related magnitude of their estimated relative risks, and define criteria for the detection of persons at risk. five hundred thirteen melanoma patients and 498 controls matched for age and sex underwent a whole-body examination for the number and type of melanocytic lesions and were interviewed on ultraviolet exposure and other potential risk factors. the total number of common melanocytic nevi on all body sites represented the most important risk factor in multiple logistic regression analysis with a relative risk of 7.6 for subjects with more than 100 versus no more than 10 melanocytic nevi. other significant independent risk factors were the number of atypical melanocytic nevi (relative risk, 6.1 for at least 5 melanocytic nevi versus none), the number of actinic lentigines (relative risk, 3.5 for many versus none), hair color, skin type, and reported melanocytic nevus growth. no single parameter of sun exposure was significantly related to melanoma risk in the multivariate analysis. groups with an estimated relative risk between 1 and 121.0 were distinguished by considering common and atypical melanocytic nevi as well as actinic lentigines as the decisive criteria. in conclusion, even without any information on the case history, whole-body examination and diagnosis of pigmented lesions was found to be an effective strategy for identifying persons at risk of developing melanoma. furthermore, clinical recognition of at least 5 atypical melanocytic nevi without histologic examination is a key for identifying subjects at high risk.
@background structural determinants for alternative splicing regulation of the mapt pre-mrna we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
@background functional implications of genetic interactions between genes encoding small gtpases involved in vesicular transport in yeast the ypt2 gene of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a member of the ypt/rab family of small gtp-binding proteins, related in sequence to sec4p of saccharomyces cerevisiae but closer to mammalian rab8. we have introduced a mutation into the gene corresponding to a mutation identified in ypt1, in which a conserved valine residue was altered to asparagine. the mutated ypt2 gene was introduced into the s. pombe genome by gene replacement. the resulting strain was temperature-sensitive for growth. normal growth was restored by introduction of a plasmid-borne wild-type ypt2 cdna or by cdna for rab8 but not by various other rab or ypt sequences. at restrictive temperature the mutant cells accumulated the secretory protein acid phosphatase in a form that appeared to be fully glycosylated and acquired a population of vesicles detectable by electron microscopy. thus the ypt2 protein, and by inference rab8, appear to function in the last stage of the secretory pathway.
@method pcr-based identification of klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, the agent of rhinoscleroma in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, the core oligosaccharide backbone of the lipopolysaccharide is modified by phosphoryl groups. the negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. in contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl groups in its core oligosaccharide but instead contains galacturonic acid residues that are proposed to serve a similar function in outer membrane stability. gla(kp) is a udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase that provides udp-galacturonic acid for core synthesis, and the enzyme was biochemically characterized because of its potentially important role in outer membrane stability. high-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used to demonstrate the udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase activity of gla(kp), and capillary electrophoresis was used for activity assays. the reaction equilibrium favors udp-galacturonic acid over udp-glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.4:1, with the k(m) for udp-glucuronic acid of 13.0 microm. gla(kp) exists as a dimer in its native form. nad+/nadh is tightly bound by the enzyme and addition of supplementary nad+ is not required for activity of the purified enzyme. divalent cations have an unexpected inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. gla(kp) was found to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro; it is capable of interconverting udp-glucose/udp-galactose and udp-n-acetylglucosamine/udp-n-acetylgalactosamine, albeit at much lower activity. the epimerase gale interconverts udp-glucose/udp-galactose. multicopy plasmid-encoded gla(kp) partially complemented a gale mutation in s. enterica and in k. pneumoniae; however, chromosomal gla(kp) could not substitute for gale in a k. pneumoniae gale mutant in vivo.
@background deconstruction and other approaches to supersymmetric lattice field theories we present preliminary numerical results from a lattice study of the two-dimensional o(3) non-linear sigma model. in the continuum this model possesses n =2 supersymmetry. the lattice formulation we use retains an exact (twisted) supersymmetry except for a soft breaking associated with a wilson mass term needed to remove the doubles. our numerical results show that the partition function is independent of coupling as predicted by supersymmetry.
@background programmed death‐1/b7‐h1 negative costimulation protects mouse liver against ischemia and reperfusion injury the proto-oncogene bcl-2 and a bcl-2-related gene bcl-x prevent apoptotic cell death induced by various treatments. although a mechanism has been proposed that involves bcl-2 activity on reactive oxygen species (ros), we find that expression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl prevents cell death induced by withdrawal of oxygen (hypoxia) and that the cell death does not involve ros, suggesting that bcl-2 or bcl-xl exerts an anti-cell death function by a mechanism other than through regulation of ros activity. using electron microscopy, and confocal and non-confocal fluorescence microscopy, we show that hypoxia induces both necrosis and apoptosis. overexpression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl blocks hypoxia-induced apoptosis and, although to a lesser extent, necrosis. the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl effectively inhibit kcn-induced cell death which is characterized by necrotic features including apparently intact chromatin, remarkable mitochondrial swelling with loss of crista structure and loss of plasma membrane integrity. the necrotic cell death is also inhibited by inhibitors of ice (interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme)(-like) proteases, the common mediators of apoptosis. these results indicate that bcl-2/bcl-xl and ice(-like) proteases modulate both apoptotic and at least some forms of necrotic cell death, suggesting that both cell death pathways involve some common mediators.
@background a rice fungal mamp-responsive mapk cascade regulates metabolic flow to antimicrobial metabolite synthesis arabidopsis map kinase 4 (mpk4) functions as a regulator of pathogen defense responses, because it is required for both repression of salicylic acid (sa)‐dependent resistance and for activation of jasmonate (ja)‐dependent defense gene expression. to understand mpk4 signaling mechanisms, we used yeast two‐hybrid screening to identify the mpk4 substrate mks1. analyses of transgenic plants and genome‐wide transcript profiling indicated that mks1 is required for full sa‐dependent resistance in mpk4 mutants, and that overexpression of mks1 in wild‐type plants is sufficient to activate sa‐dependent resistance, but does not interfere with induction of a defense gene by ja. further yeast two‐hybrid screening revealed that mks1 interacts with the wrky transcription factors wrky25 and wrky33. wrky25 and wrky33 were shown to be in vitro substrates of mpk4, and a wrky33 knockout mutant was found to exhibit increased expression of the sa‐related defense gene pr1. mks1 may therefore contribute to mpk4‐regulated defense activation by coupling the kinase to specific wrky transcription factors.
@background vegf189 expression is highly related to adaptation of the plateau pika (ochotona curzoniae) inhabiting high altitudes. lung development and repair of hyperoxic injury require closely regulated growth and regeneration of alveolar capillaries. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), a mitogen for endothelial cells, is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. alternative splicing of vegf mrna results in isoforms of varying mitogenicity and solubility. we examined changes in the proportions of the vegf splice variant mrnas in rabbit lung development and in control, oxygen-injured, and recovering newborn and adult rabbit lungs. the proportion of the 189-amino acid vegf mrna, which codes for an isoform that binds to the extracellular matrix, increased fivefold during development (from 8% of total vegf message at 22 days gestation to 40% in 10-day newborn lungs; p < 0.001). during neonatal oxygen injury, its expression declined from 38 to 8% of vegf message (p < 0.002) and returned to the control value in recovery. a similar pattern was observed in adults. vegf protein in lung lavage fluid increased slightly during hyperoxia, declined to barely detectable levels at the 50% lethal dose time point, and increased 10-fold (newborn) or up to 40-fold (adult) in recovering animals. we conclude that alternative splicing may have important roles in the regulation of vegf activity in developing and injured lungs.
@result cocaine locomotor activation, sensitization and place preference in six inbred strains of mice a meta-analysis was conducted on the data obtained from published articles that have used the conditioned place preference (cpp) paradigm to assess the rewarding effects of morphine, heroin, amphetamine and cocaine in rats. using a histogram analysis of the data, significant dose-effect curves were evident with all of the drugs examined, except for cocaine. analysis of the data also revealed that several methodological variables moderated the effect size for cpp, at least with some of the drugs examined. in particular, the following methodological variables significantly moderated cpp effect size: strain of rat used; housing condition (single or group cages); type of apparatus (2 or 3 compartments); preconditioning test (present or absent); route of drug administration; intervening saline trials (present or absent); conditioning trial duration; and drug compartment (nonpreferred, counterbalanced or white). no significant effect size differences were evident using sex, number of drug trials, or test duration as moderator variables in the analyses. these meta-analytic results may be useful to investigators for maximizing the effect size of drug-induced cpp.
@method biexponential longitudinal relaxation in white matter: characterization and impact on t1 mapping with ir‐fse and mp2rage brain water proton (1h2o) longitudinal relaxation time constants (t1) were obtained from three healthy individuals at magnetic field strengths (b0) of 0.2 tesla (t), 1.0t, 1.5t, 4.0t, and 7.0t. a 5‐mm midventricular axial slice was sampled using a modified look‐locker technique with 1.5 mm in‐plane resolution, and 32 time points post‐adiabatic inversion. the results confirmed that for most brain tissues, t1 values increased by more than a factor of 3 between 0.2t and 7t, and over this range were well fitted by t1 (s) = 0.583(b0)0.382, t1(s) = 0.857(b0)0.376, and t1(s) = 1.35(b0)0.340 for white matter (wm), internal gm, and blood 1h2o, respectively. the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 1h2o t1 value did not change with b0, and its average value (standard deviation (sd)) across subjects and magnetic fields was 4.3 (±0.2) s. the tissue 1/t1 values at each field were well correlated with the macromolecular mass fraction, and to a lesser extent tissue iron content. the field‐dependent increases in 1h2o t1 values more than offset the well‐known decrease in typical mri contrast reagent (cr) relaxivity, and simulations predict that this leads to lower cr concentration detection thresholds with increased magnetic field. magn reson med 57:308–318, 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
@background increased severity and mortality in adults co-infected with malaria and hiv in maputo, mozambique: a prospective cross-sectional study background malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-saharan africa.   objective the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria among long distance truck drivers in the niger delta of nigeria.   methods a total of one hundred consecutively recruited long distance truck drivers aged 21-60 years, with a mean age of 42.36 ± 5.23 years were screened for the presence of malaria parasitaemia.   results out of the 100 truck drivers screened, 35 (35%) were positive for malaria while 65 (65%) were negative. plasmodium falciparum was responsible for all cases of malaria infection. the highest prevalence of malaria occurred among drivers in the 51-60 years age group (40.5%). the mean and standard deviation (sd) of parasite load was 1 020 (125) parasites/ìl in subjects positive for malaria. the mean cd4 count was significantly higher among non-parasitized truck drivers compared to p. falciparum parasitized drivers 820 ± 42.0 (731-902 cells/ µl) and 570 ± 30.0 (510-630 cells/ µl) respectively (chi square = 74.00; p = 0.03). we observed a significant negative correlation between plasmodial infection and cd4 lymphocyte count among plasmodium falciparum-infected subjects with r = - 0.56 (p= 0.001).   conclusion preventative strategies including regular chemoprophylaxis, intermittent preventive treatment with antimalarials and provision of insecticide-treated bed nets should be implemented.
@background papillary carcinoma with extensive squamous metaplasia arising from thyroglossal duct cyst in an 11-year-old girl: significance of differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma: a case report. carcinoma within the thyroglossal duct (tgdca) is a very rare pediatric tumor. this report presents the case of a 15-year-old girl with tgdca, reviews the previously published pediatric cases of this tumor, and provides diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in tgdca in children. twenty one cases of tgdca have been reported, 12 of them in females. mean age at presentation was approximately 13 years for females and approximately 12 years for males. the duration of a midcervical mass prior to the diagnosis of tgdca varied from 3 weeks to 8 years. the size of the neck mass at presentation averaged 2 cm-4 cm. all masses were asymptomatic, and the diagnosis of tgdca was incidental following surgery. all pediatric cases of tgdca reported thus far were of the papillary type, except for 3 patients who presented with a mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma. capsular invasion was detected in 10 (45%) patients. local invasive disease was found in 5 (23%) patients, but all removed thyroid glands (12) were free of carcinoma. one patient had lung metastases. thyroidectomy with subsequent radioiodine ablation was the treatment of choice in the majority of the cases. the reported prognosis for tgdca in children was favorable, with only one reported death.
@background methylation of parp-1 promoter involved in the regulation of benzene-induced decrease of parp-1 mrna expression. exposure to benzene is generally accepted as a cause of acute myeloid leukemia (aml), but the association with other cell types of leukemia and other lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers is controversial. we compiled epidemiologic research on benzene and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers in order to assess the pattern of associations. eighteen relevant community-based and 16 industry-based studies were located. four of seven studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in the aggregate identified relative risks of 1.8 or more, and eight of 14 total leukemia studies yielded relative risks in that range. the few available studies of specific histologic types of leukemia do not indicate larger or more consistent elevations in risk for aml compared to other leukemia cell types. sporadic reports have linked benzene to non-hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but most studies do not indicate a positive association. limitations in study quality, particularly exposure assessment, pervade all of the studies reviewed, and the distinction between studies addressing benzene and those addressing jobs in industries that use benzene is somewhat arbitrary. nonetheless, the epidemiologic evidence linking benzene to leukemia in the aggregate, as well as for subtypes other than aml, is no less persuasive than that for aml alone.
@method validation of activity tracking procedures in elderly patients after operative treatment of proximal femur fractures we have studied the effect of shortening of the femoral neck and varus collapse on the functional capacity and quality of life of patients who had undergone fixation of an isolated intracapsular fracture of the hip with cancellous screws. after screening 660 patients at four university medical centres, 70 patients with a mean age of 71 years (20 to 90) met the inclusion criteria. overall, 66% (46 of 70) of the fractures healed with > 5 mm of shortening and 39% (27 of 70) with > 5 degrees of varus. patients with severe shortening of the femoral neck had significantly lower short form-36 questionnaire (sf-36) physical functioning scores (no/mild (<5 mm) vs severe shortening (> 10 mm); 74 vs 42 points, p < 0.001). a similar effect was noted with moderate shortening, suggesting a gradient effect (no/mild (< 5 mm) vs moderate shortening (5 to 10 mm); 74 vs 53 points, p = 0.011). varus collapse correlated moderately with the occurrence of shortening (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). shortening also resulted in a significantly lower euroqol questionnaire (eq5d) index scores (p = 0.05). in a regression analysis shortening of the femoral neck was the only significant variable predictive of a low sf-36 physical functioning score (p < 0.001).
@method aortic stiffness and ambulatory blood pressure as predictors of diabetic kidney disease: a competing risks analysis from the rio de janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort study objective the action in diabetes and vascular disease: preterax and diamicron mr controlled evaluation (advance) trial reported that intensive glucose control prevents end-stage kidney disease (eskd) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but uncertainty about the balance between risks and benefits exists. here, we examine the long-term effects of intensive glucose control on risk of eskd and other outcomes. research design and methods survivors, previously randomized to intensive or standard glucose control, were invited to participate in post-trial follow-up. eskd, defined as the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, or death due to kidney disease, was documented overall and by baseline ckd stage, along with hypoglycemic episodes, major cardiovascular events, and death from other causes. results a total of 8,494 advance participants were followed for a median of 5.4 additional years. in-trial hba1c differences disappeared by the first post-trial visit. the in-trial reductions in the risk of eskd (7 vs. 20 events, hazard ratio [hr] 0.35, p = 0.02) persisted after 9.9 years of overall follow-up (29 vs. 53 events, hr 0.54, p < 0.01). these effects were greater in earlier-stage ckd (p = 0.04) and at lower baseline systolic blood pressure levels (p = 0.01). the effects of glucose lowering on the risks of death, cardiovascular death, or major cardiovascular events did not differ by levels of kidney function (p > 0.26). conclusions intensive glucose control was associated with a long-term reduction in eskd, without evidence of any increased risk of cardiovascular events or death. these benefits were greater with preserved kidney function and with well-controlled blood pressure.
@method newly isolated but uncultivated magnetotactic bacterium of the phylum nitrospirae from beijing, china a combination of polymerase chain reaction-assisted rrna sequence retrieval and fluorescent oligonucleotide probing was used to identify in situ a hitherto unculturable, big, magnetotactic, rod-shaped organism in freshwater sediment samples collected from lake chiemsee. tentatively named "magnetobacterium bavaricum," this bacterium is evolutionarily distant from all other phylogenetically characterized magnetotactic bacteria and contains unusually high numbers of magnetosomes (up to 1,000 magnetosomes per cell). the spatial distribution in the sediment was studied, and up to 7 x 10 active cells per cm were found in the microaerobic zone. considering its average volume (25.8 +/- 4.1 mum) and relative abundance (0.64 +/- 0.17%), "m. bavaricum" may account for approximately 30% of the microbial biovolume and may therefore be a dominant fraction of the microbial community in this layer. its microhabitat and its high content of sulfur globules and magnetosomes suggest that this organism has an iron-dependent way of energy conservation which depends on balanced gradients of oxygen and sulfide.
@method multimodal imaging of mild traumatic brain injury and persistent postconcussion syndrome objectives to examine patterns of brain activation while performing a working memory task in persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) and healthy controls. it is well established that working memory is an area of cognition that is especially vulnerable to disruption after tbi. although much has been learned about the system of cerebral representation of working memory in healthy people, little is known about how this system is disrupted by tbi.   methods functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) was used to assess brain activation during a working memory task (a modified version of the paced auditory serial addition test) in nine patients with tbi and seven healthy controls.   results patients with tbi were able to perform the task, but made significantly more errors than healthy controls. cerebral activation in both groups was found in similar regions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and resembled patterns of activation found in previous neuroimaging studies of working memory in healthy persons. however, compared with the healthy controls, the tbi group displayed a pattern of cerebral activation that was more regionally dispersed and more lateralised to the right hemisphere. differences in lateralisation were particularly evident in the frontal lobes.   conclusions impairment of working memory in tbi seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity.
@background mapping of a new stem rust resistance gene sr49 in chromosome 5b of wheat key messagewe have demonstrated that genomic selection in diverse wheat landraces for resistance to leaf, stem and strip rust is possible, as genomic breeding values were moderately accurate. markers with large effects in the bayesian analysis confirmed many known genes, while also discovering many previously uncharacterised genome regions associated with rust scores.abstractgenomic selection, where selection decisions are based on genomic estimated breeding values (gebvs) derived from genome-wide dna markers, could accelerate genetic progress in plant breeding. in this study, we assessed the accuracy of gebvs for rust resistance in 206 hexaploid wheat (triticum aestivum) landraces from the watkins collection of phenotypically diverse wheat genotypes from 32 countries. the landraces were genotyped for 5,568 snps using an illumina iselect 9 k bead chip assay and phenotyped for field-based leaf rust (lr), stem rust (sr) and stripe rust (yr) responses across multiple years. genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gblup) and a bayesian regression method (bayesr) were used to predict gebvs. based on fivefold cross-validation, the accuracy of genomic prediction averaged across years was 0.35, 0.27 and 0.44 for lr, sr and yr using gblup and 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 for lr, sr and yr using bayesr, respectively. inclusion of pcr-predicted genotypes for known rust resistance genes increased accuracy more substantially when the marker was diagnostic (lr34/sr57/yr18) for the presence-absence of the gene rather than just linked (sr2). investigation of the impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference lines on accuracy of genomic prediction showed that accuracy will be higher when each validation line had at least one close relationship to the reference lines. overall, the prediction accuracies achieved in this study are encouraging, and confirm the feasibility of genomic selection in wheat. in several instances, estimated marker effects were confirmed by published literature and results of mapping experiments using watkins accessions.
@method coronaviruses and arteriviruses display striking differences in their cyclophilin a-dependence during replication in cell culture the gene expression of plus-strand rna viruses with a polycistronic genome depends on translation and replication of the genomic mrna, as well as synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mrnas. arteriviruses and coronaviruses, distantly related members of the nidovirus order, employ a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand rna synthesis to generate subgenome-length templates for the synthesis of a nested set of sg mrnas. non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (eav), a multifunctional regulator of viral rna synthesis and virion biogenesis, was previously implicated in controlling the balance between genome replication and sg mrna synthesis. here, we employed reverse and forward genetics to gain insight into the multiple regulatory roles of nsp1. our analysis revealed that the relative abundance of viral mrnas is tightly controlled by an intricate network of interactions involving all nsp1 subdomains. distinct nsp1 mutations affected the quantitative balance among viral mrna species, and our data implicate nsp1 in controlling the accumulation of full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates for viral mrna synthesis. the moderate differential changes in viral mrna abundance of nsp1 mutants resulted in similarly altered viral protein levels, but progeny virus yields were greatly reduced. pseudorevertant analysis provided compelling genetic evidence that balanced eav mrna accumulation is critical for efficient virus production. this first report on protein-mediated, mrna-specific control of nidovirus rna synthesis reveals the existence of an integral control mechanism to fine-tune replication, sg mrna synthesis, and virus production, and establishes a major role for nsp1 in coordinating the arterivirus replicative cycle.
@method motion‐corrected simultaneous cardiac positron emission tomography and coronary mr angiography with high acquisition efficiency noninvasive imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of heart failure, assessment of prognosis, and monitoring of therapy. cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) offers a comprehensive assessment of heart failure patients and is now the gold standard imaging technique to assess myocardial anatomy, regional and global function, and viability. furthermore, it allows assessment of perfusion and acute tissue injury (edema and necrosis), whereas in nonischemic heart failure, fibrosis, infiltration, and iron overload can be detected. the information derived from cmr often reveals the underlying etiology of heart failure, and its high measurement accuracy makes it an ideal technique for monitoring disease progression and the effects of treatment. evidence on the prognostic value of cmr-derived parameters in heart failure is rapidly emerging. this review summarizes the advantages of cmr for patients with heart failure and its important role in key areas.
@background development of a model for inducing transient insulin resistance in the mare: preliminary implications regarding the estrous cycle. to examine whether and how intramyocellular lipid (imcl) content contributes to interindividual variation in insulin action, we studied 20 healthy men with no family history of type 2 diabetes. imcl was measured as the resonance of intramyocellular ch(2) protons in lipids/resonance of ch(3) protons of total creatine (imcl/cr(t)), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vastus lateralis muscle. whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured using a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (insulin infusion rate 40 mu/m(2). min) clamp. muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and 30 min after initiation of the insulin infusion to assess insulin signaling. the subjects were divided into groups with high imcl (hiimcl; 9.5 +/- 0.9 imcl/cr(t), n = 10) and low imcl (loimcl; 3.0 +/- 0.5 imcl/cr(t), n = 10), the cut point being median imcl (6.1 imcl/cr(t)). the groups were comparable with respect to age (43 +/- 3 vs. 40 +/- 3 years, ns, hiimcl versus loimcl), bmi (26 +/- 1 vs. 26 +/- 1 kg/m(2), ns), and maximal oxygen consumption (33 +/- 2 vs. 36 +/- 3 ml. kg(-1). min(-1), ns). whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was lower in the hiimcl group (3.0 +/- 0.4 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) than the loimcl group (5.1 +/- 0.5 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), p < 0.05). serum free fatty acid concentrations were comparable basally, but during hyperinsulinemia, they were 35% higher in the hiimcl group than the loimcl group (p < 0.01). study of insulin signaling indicated that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (ir) was blunted in hiimcl compared with loimcl (57 vs. 142% above basal, p < 0.05), while protein expression of the ir was unaltered. ir substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3-kinase activation by insulin was also lower in the hiimcl group than in the loimcl group (49 +/- 23 vs. 84 +/- 27% above basal, p < 0.05 between hiimcl and loimcl). in conclusion, imcl accumulation is associated with whole-body insulin resistance and with defective insulin signaling in skeletal muscle independent of body weight and physical fitness.
@background increased fusiform area activation in schizophrenia during processing of spatial frequency-degraded faces, as revealed by fmri. pathways within the visual system can be distinguished on the basis of selectivity for low or high spatial frequencies. spatial frequency discrimination was evaluated in 17 medicated male patients with schizophrenia and 19 male control subjects. subjects were required to discriminate whether pairs of high contrast, sinusoidally modulated gratings were the same or different in spatial frequency. accuracy performance was compared at high, medium, and low spatial frequencies on tasks matched for control performance. patients showed a greater performance decrement of 12% on low as compared with 4% on high spatial frequencies. these findings suggest a disturbance of right hemisphere mechanisms involved in spatial perception and attention in schizophrenia.
@background menopause occurs late in life in the captive chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) changes in the endocrinology of the pituitary-ovarian axis first become manifest at about the age of 40, a selective rise in serum follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) levels occurring at about the same time as a marked acceleration in the loss of primordial follicles from the ovary. fsh levels gradually increase with increasing age in women who continue to cycle regularly. during the menopausal transition, initiated when changes in cycle frequency or in menstrual flow are first observed, both gonadotrophins, oestradiol and inhibin show a marked degree of variability with abrupt changes from typical post-menopausal patterns to those characteristic of the reproductive age group. within 1-2 years after the final menstrual period or menopause, fsh levels are markedly elevated, luteinizing hormone (lh) levels moderately so, while oestradiol and inhibin levels are low or undetectable. post-menopausally, adrenal androstenedione is the major source of oestrogen and serum testosterone levels fall moderately, with oophorectomy leading to a further significant fall. serum sex hormone binding globulin levels fall to a small degree post-menopausally. areas of persisting controversy include the question of whether oestradiol levels fall with increasing age prior to the onset of the menopausal transition, the relative roles of oestradiol and inhibin in the selective rise of serum fsh and the role of serum androgens post-menopausally.
@background diagnostic tools for assessment of urinary dysfunction in ms patients without urinary disturbances objective to review current management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (nlutd) in ms patients and give recommendations on the joint role of the neurologist and urologist in nlutd management.   methods an algorithm for evaluation and referral of ms patients to urologists was created. it is an outcome of discussions about current knowledge, existing guidelines, and key issues during two belgian consensus meetings attended by neurologists, urologists and other stakeholders involved in ms management. at these meetings, updated information on management of nlutd in ms was exchanged and the neurologists' opinion on how to integrate this in the other aspects of care in ms patients was explored.   results short evaluation of nlutd in ms patients by neurologists and appropriate referral to urologists could accelerate proper diagnosis and treatment. neurologists can play a central role in the inter-disciplinary communication on interactions between disease manifestations of ms and their treatments.   conclusion the coordinating role of neurologists in nlutd management may considerably improve qol in ms patients. more research is needed to evaluate outcomes of urological assessments and treatment.
@background effect of triadimefon: a triazole fungicide on oxidative stress defense system and eugenol content in ocimum tenuiflorum l. more than 300 catalase sequences are now available, divided among monofunctional catalases (> 225), bifunctional catalase-peroxidases (> 50) and manganese-containing catalases (> 25). when combined with the recent appearance of crystal structures from at least two representatives from each of these groups (nine from the monofunctional catalases), valuable insights into the catalatic reaction mechanism in its various forms and into catalase evolution have been gained. the structures have revealed an unusually large number of modifications unique to catalases, a result of interacting with reactive oxygen species. biochemical and physiological characterization of catalases from many different organisms has revealed a surprisingly wide range of catalatic efficiencies, despite similar sequences. catalase gene expression in micro-organisms generally is controlled either by sensors of reactive oxygen species or by growth phase regulons, although the detailed mechanisms vary considerably.
@background hemangiopericytoma-associated hypoglycemia improved by glucocorticoid therapy: a case report serum insulin-like growth factor ii (igf-ii) was characterized by radioimmunoassay and western immunoblot in 44 patients with non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (nicth). 31 of 44 patients with nicth had big igf-ii in sera. when the presence of igf-ii in tumors from 20 patients was investigated, igf-ii in tumors was detected in 18 patients and these patients had big igf-ii in sera. in two patients whose tumors did not contain igf-ii, big igf-ii in sera was not detected. in six patients with igf-ii in tumors, hypoglycemia disappeared and the big igf-ii decreased after successful removal of the tumors. these data indicate that the big igf-ii could be related to hypoglycemia, and that the increased serum big igf-ii suggests igf-ii-producing nicth. serum igf-ii levels in 31 patients with big igf-ii were greater than those in 13 patients without it (mean +/- sem: 723+/-54 vs. 326+/-31 ng/ml), but the elevated igf-ii levels were found in only 13 patients. serum igf-i levels were low in all patients with nicth. in the 13 patients without big igf-ii, serum igf-ii levels were lower than those in the patients with big igf-ii, and serum igf-i levels were also low. serum igf-ii/igf-i ratios in the patients with big igf-ii were elevated and greater than those in the patients without big igf-ii (35.0+/-2.2 vs. 11.5+/-2.4). the present data indicate that igf-ii-producing tumors are not rare in nicth, and serum big igf-ii and igf-ii/igf-i ratio are useful for screening patients with igf-ii-producing nicth.
@method radioactive iodine administration is associated with persistent related symptoms in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer salivary gland side effects (sses) can be a source of significant morbidity in thyroid cancer patients receiving radioactive iodine (rai) for remnant ablation or therapy. however, the incidence, time course, and ultimate resolution of sses that develop in the first few months after a single administered activity of rai for remnant ablation has not be adequately defined. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients after rai remnant ablation (rra) to determine the incidence of salivary gland–related side effects reported within the first year of rra, the dose-response relationship between administered activity and specific sses, and the incidence of specific sses based on the method of preparation for remnant ablation (recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone [rhtsh] vs. traditional thyroid hormone withdrawal [thw]). results: sses were reported within the first year of rai ablation in 39% of a cohort of 262 patients (66% women, 93% papillary thyroid cancer; median dose, 5,217 mbq [141 mci]). persistent side effects were noted after a median of 7 y in 5% or less of the entire cohort. however, when side effects developed in patients during the first year, the incidence of persistence of the symptom at last follow-up ranged from 5% to 13%. a statistically significant dose response was seen between administered activity of rai and development of salivary gland swelling (p = 0.001, logistic dose-response curve) but not with dry mouth (p = 0.63), altered taste (p = 0.27), or salivary gland pain (p = 0.152). sses developed in 14% of patients receiving administered activities of 1,110 mbq (30 mci); administered activities of 2,775 mbq (75 mci) or more were associated with symptoms in 40% of patients (p = 0.046). despite receiving a statistically higher administered activity (5,661 ± 2,997 mbq [153 ± 81 mci] for thw vs. 4,958 ± 2,294 mbq [134 ± 62 mci] for rhtsh), thw was associated with a lower rate of salivary gland swelling than the rhtsh preparation (20% vs. 10%; p = 0.017), without differences in the development of dry mouth, altered taste, or salivary gland pain. conclusion: although sses occurred in 39% of patients after routine rra, they were usually transient, so that the overall incidence of persistent side effects at a median follow-up of 7 y was only 5%. even though the risk for persistent side effects is rather small, these data do emphasize the need to select patients carefully for rra who are thought to be at moderate to high risk for recurrence and to use the minimally effective dose of rai activity, in an attempt to maximize the potential benefit while minimizing the risk for adverse events for an individual patient.
@background contemporary management of traumatic intracranial hypertension: is there a role for therapeutic hypothermia? background infectious complications are among the most serious problems that occur in severely head-injured patients treated with mild hypothermia. the mechanism underlying the susceptibility to infection has not been clarified. heat shock protein (hsp) 60 has been reported to play an essential role in innate immunity. thus, we conducted a study to clarify the impact of mild hypothermia on the expression of hsps in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls) in severely head-injured patients.   methods between september 1997 and november 1999, 17 severely head-injured patients with a glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less at admission in whom intracranial pressure could be maintained below 20 mm hg by conventional therapy were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: a mild hypothermia group (ht group, nine patients) and a normothermia group (nt group, eight patients). the ht group was subjected to mild hypothermia (intracranial temperature, 34 degrees c) for 48 hours followed by rewarming at a rate of 1 degrees c per day for 3 days, whereas the nt group was subjected to normothermia (intracranial temperature, 37 degrees c) for 5 days. blood samples were serially obtained at three time points; days 0 to 1, days 2 to 5, and days 6 to 14 after head injury. we measured the expression of hsp27, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90 by flow cytometry.   results the two groups were similar with respect to prognostic factors, and there was no difference in clinical outcome. the expression of pmnl hsp60 in the ht group was significantly lower in all three time periods compared with that in the nt group (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly between the groups. the incidence of infectious complications was significantly increased in the ht group over that in the nt group (p < 0.05). in in vitro studies, pmnls from 10 healthy volunteers were incubated at 37 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 26 degrees c for 1 hour with sodium arsenite (100 micromol/l), an hsp inducer. the expression of hsp60 at 26 degrees c and 34 degrees c was significantly lower than that at 37 degrees c (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly at 26 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 37 degrees c.   conclusion mild hypothermia reduces the expression of hsp60 in pmnls from severely head-injured patients. thus, mild hypothermia may suppress innate immunity.
@background is there a solution to publication bias? researchers call for changes in dissemination of clinical research results. aims to identify trends in the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers to the new zealand quitline, a national free-phone smoking cessation service, between 2001 and 2005. methods demographic and smoking behaviour of quitline callers were routinely collected by quit advisors over the phone. characteristics of new callers were extracted from the client database, and compared across 5 years to determine changes over time. results statistically significant differences were found in all variables (except for gender) across the 5-year period. the results show an increased proportion of callers are under 25 years old (67% increase), started smoking at 15 years old or older (10% increase), and/or have smoked for less than 10 years (86% increase). there is also an increased proportion of callers smoking roll-your-own cigarettes (13% increase). in terms of ethnicity, the proportion of pacific people using the quitline increased by 54%, while the proportion of māori callers fluctuated at just above 20% of all new callers. the proportion of pregnant callers also increased over time (127% increase) although the overall percent remains small. conclusions the results indicate notable changes in the characteristics of new quitline callers between 2001 and 2005. such information will be of benefit to the future design of quitline marketing and adapting service provision to best meet the needs of callers. new zealand’s national free-phone quitline was established in 1999. since then, no analysis has been conducted to identify trends in characteristics of callers over time. similar research appears to be lacking in other countries, where researchers have built profiles using accumulated statistics without addressing changes over time. this study therefore aimed to explore this aspect by analysing the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers registering with the new zealand quitline during the 5 years from 2001 to 2005. in november 2000, the new zealand quitline became a world-first by providing heavily subsidised nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) in the form of patches and gum as an adjunct to its telephone smoking cessation service. prior to the introduction of nrt, quitline callers received information and practical strategies for quitting, along with proactive follow-up calls from a quit advisor for quit support and advice. with the new service, callers are eligible to receive nrt when certain conditions are met (such as a satisfactory medical history and a commitment to quit). the availability of heavily subsidised nrt (a 92% reduction in the over-the-counter price) was well received by the smoking population, evidenced in the sharp increase of callers that was sustained for several years. this was similar to a more recent experience in minnesota, usa where the quitline offering free patches and gum to callers.
@background multikinase inhibitor sorafenib prevents pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in rats by blocking the c-raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway the natriuretic peptides (nps) are a group of peptide hormones that play important roles in the control of renal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and skeletal homeostasis. atrial np (anp) was first identified as an activity by de bold et al1 in 1981. it is a 28 amino acid peptide in humans that assumes a hairpin structure by virtue of a cystine bridge that links residues 7 and 23 (figure 1). brain np (bnp), also known as the b-type np, is 32 amino acids long in the human. it has a similar hairpin structure but demonstrates considerably more heterogeneity across species than anp. c-type np (cnp) is a 22 amino acid peptide that has a truncated carboxy terminus beyond the second cystine residue in the bridge.     figure 1. primary structure of human nps.    anp and bnp are produced primarily within the muscle cells of the heart. anp shows a preference for expression in the cardiac atria versus ventricle, whereas bnp is more equivalently expressed throughout the heart. anp is also expressed in the hypothalamus where it is thought to control blood pressure (bp), sympathetic outflow, vasopressin secretion, drinking behavior, and cardiovascular homeostasis. bnp, on the other hand, is expressed in the brains of only a few species (eg, pig and dog), where its function remains unknown. cnp is expressed in the central nervous system, reproductive tract, bone, and endothelium of blood vessels.  there are 3 different types of np receptors, and each of them spans the membrane bilayer as a single transmembrane segment. the type a np receptor (npr-a) is also known as the particulate guanylyl cyclase a. it is the high affinity receptor for both anp and bnp. a schematic of the structure of this receptor is presented in figure 2. npr-a has a glycosylated, extracellular, ligand-binding domain linked to …
@background heat-activated sustaining nitric oxide release from zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate loaded in thermo-sensitive liposomes. selected nucleophile/nitric oxide adducts [compounds which contain the anionic moiety, xn(o-)n = o] were studied for their ability to release nitric oxide spontaneously in aqueous solution and for possible vasoactivity. the diversity of structures chosen included those in which the nucleophile residue, x, was that of a secondary amine [et2n, as in [et2nn(n = o)o]na, 1], a primary amine [iprhn, as in [iprhnn(n = o)o]na, 2], a polyamine, spermine [as in the zwitterion h2n(ch2)3nh2+(ch2)4n[n(n = o)o-](ch2)3nh2, 3], oxide [as in na[on(n = o)o]na, 4], and sulfite [as in nh4[o3sn(n = o)o]nh4, 5]. the rate constants (k) for decomposition in ph 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees c, as measured by following loss of chromophore at 230-260 nm, were as follows: 1, 5.4 x 10(-3) s-1; 2, 5.1 x 10(-3) s-1; 3, 0.30 x 10(-3) s-1; 4, 5.0 x 10(-3) s-1; and 5, 1.7 x 10(-3) s-1. the corresponding extents of nitric oxide release (eno) were 1.5, 0.73, 1.9, 0.54, and 0.001 mol/mol of starting material consumed, respectively, as determined from the integrated chemiluminescence response. vasodilatory activities expressed as the concentrations required to induce 50% relaxation in norepinephrine-constricted aortic rings bathed in ph 7.4 buffer at 37 degrees c (ec50) were as follows: 1, 0.19 microm; 2, 0.45 microm; 3, 6.2 microm; 4, 0.59 microm; and 5, 62 microm. vasorelaxant potency (expressed as 1/ec50) was strongly correlated with the quantity of .no calculated from the physicochemical data to be released in the interval required to achieve maximum relaxation at the ec50 doses (r = 0.995). this suggests that such nucleophile/.no adducts might generally be useful as vehicles for the nonenzymatic generation of nitric oxide, in predictable amounts and at predictable rates, for biological purposes. the particular significance for possible drug design is underscored in the very favorable potency comparison between several of these agents and the established nitrovasodilators sodium nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate (ec50 values of 2.0 and greater than 10 microm, respectively) in parallel aortic ring tests.

@result changes in prefrontal and amygdala activity during olanzapine treatment in schizophrenia introduction patients with schizophrenia show deficits in facial affect and facial identity recognition and exhibit structural and neurophysiological abnormalities in brain regions known to mediate these processes. functional neuroimaging studies of neural responses to emotional facial expressions in schizophrenia have reported both increases and decreases in medial temporal lobe (mtl) activity in schizophrenia. some of this variability may be related to the tasks performed and the baseline conditions used. here we tested whether mtl responses to human faces in schizophrenia are abnormal when unconstrained by a cognitive task and measured relative to a low-level baseline (fixation) condition.   methods 15 patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while passively viewing human faces displaying fearful, happy, and neutral emotional expressions.   results relative to control subjects, the patients demonstrated (1) significantly greater activation of the left hippocampus while viewing all three facial expressions and (2) increased right amygdala activation during the initial presentation of fearful and neutral facial expressions.   conclusions in schizophrenia, hippocampal and amygdala activity is elevated during the passive viewing of human faces.
@background visual tracking via subspace learning: a discriminative approach in this paper, we propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm. in contrast to existing methods, the proposed least soft-thresold squares (lss) algorithm models the error term with the gaussian-laplacian distribution, which can be solved efficiently. based on maximum joint likelihood of parameters, we derive a lss distance to measure the difference between an observation sample and the dictionary. compared with the distance derived from ordinary least squares methods, the proposed metric is more effective in dealing with outliers. in addition, we present an update scheme to capture the appearance change of the tracked target and ensure that the model is properly updated. experimental results on several challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves more favorable performance than the state-of-the-art methods.
@background comparison of enteral nutrition with combined enteral and parenteral nutrition in post-pancreaticoduodenectomy patients: a pilot study patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (pd) often require postoperative artificial nutrition. this trial was undertaken to evaluate whether the route of administration and the composition of the postoperative nutritional support could affect the immunometabolic response and outcome. a prospective, randomized trial was carried out in 212 subjects who underwent pd. patients were randomized to receive a standard enteral formula (standard group, n = 73) or an enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and rna (immunonutrition group, n = 71), or total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group, n = 68). postoperative feeding started 6 hours after surgery. the three regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. assessed parameters were phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, plasma interleukin-2 receptors, c-reactive protein, retinol binding protein, tolerance of enteral feeding, rate of postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay (los). full nutritional goal (25 kcal/kg) was achieved in 87% of enterally fed patients versus 95% in the parenteral group. subjects receiving immunonutrition had a significantly better recovery of the immunometabolic parameters on postoperative day 8 compared to the other two groups. the rate of postoperative complications was lower in the immunonutrition group (33.8%) than in either the standard (43.8%) or parenteral group (58.8%) (p = 0.005 immunonutrition vs. parenteral). also, the mean los was shorter in the immunonutrition group than in the standard and parenteral groups (15.1 vs. 17.0 vs. 18.8 days, respectively;p < 0.05). early postoperative enteral feeding may safely and effectively replace parenteral nutrition in patients undergoing pd. immunonutrition ameliorates the immunometabolic response and improves outcome compared to parenteral feeding.
@method evolution of occupational exposure to environmental levels of aromatic hydrocarbons in service stations. work on deck on eight oil product tankers was examined. the purpose was to evaluate the need for improvement of the working environment to reduce the risk of occupational cancer. benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and organic lead compounds were sampled, and the crew answered a questionnaire on acute health effects. by area monitoring, benzene was generally found to be in the range from the detection limit, of 0.01 ppm, up to 1.15 ppm, but one tanker which loaded gasoline with the hatches open had levels up to 55 ppm. personal monitoring showed exposure levels in the range 0.01-1.15 ppm. the pah-levels and the levels of organic lead were low. no seamen were observed using respiratory protective equipment. central nervous system symptoms were reported by the crew with the highest exposures to benzene although benzene may not be the only cause. the exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons on the deck of oil product tankers ought to be reduced.
@result systematic prediction of scaffold proteins reveals new design principles in scaffold-mediated signal transduction budding yeast contain at least four distinct mapk (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascades that transduce a variety of intracellular signals: mating-pheromone response, pseudohyphal/invasive growth, cell wall integrity, and high osmolarity adaptation. although each mapk cascade contains a conserved set of three protein kinases, the upstream activation mechanisms for these cascades are diverse, including a trimeric g protein, monomeric small g proteins, and a prokaryotic-like two-component system. recently, it became apparent that there is extensive sharing of signaling elements among the mapk pathways; however, little undesirable cross-talk occurs between various cascades. the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes is probably centrally important for this insulation of individual mapk cascades.
@method to tune or not to tune: rule evaluation for metaheuristic-based sequential covering algorithms discrete values have important roles in data mining and knowledge discovery. they are about intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify, easier to use and comprehend as they are closer to a knowledge-level representation than continuous values. many studies show induction tasks can benefit from discretization: rules with discrete values are normally shorter and more understandable and discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy. furthermore, many induction algorithms found in the literature require discrete features. all these prompt researchers and practitioners to discretize continuous features before or during a machine learning or data mining task. there are numerous discretization methods available in the literature. it is time for us to examine these seemingly different methods for discretization and find out how different they really are, what are the key components of a discretization process, how we can improve the current level of research for new development as well as the use of existing methods. this paper aims at a systematic study of discretization methods with their history of development, effect on classification, and trade-off between speed and accuracy. contributions of this paper are an abstract description summarizing existing discretization methods, a hierarchical framework to categorize the existing methods and pave the way for further development, concise discussions of representative discretization methods, extensive experiments and their analysis, and some guidelines as to how to choose a discretization method under various circumstances. we also identify some issues yet to solve and future research for discretization.

@background tertiary dentinogenesis with calcium hydroxide: a review of proposed mechanisms. lipopolysaccharide (lps), a cell wall component of gram negative anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical disease resulting from infected root canals. calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] has been shown to be an effective medicament in such infections, reducing the microbial titre within the canal. it has been proposed that the therapeutic effect of ca(oh)2 may also be the result of direct inactivation of lps. the aim of this study was to investigate whether the toxic potential of an escherichia coli lps could be reduced or eliminated by ca(oh)2. four concentrations of e. coli lps ranging from 1-1000 ng/ml sterile water were incubated in duplicate either with 25 mg ca(oh)2 or sterile water alone. controls consisted of ca(oh)2 without lps or sterile water only. monocytes were collected from peripheral blood by centrifuging through a gradient and plated to a specific density. adherent monocytes were incubated for 4 days at 37 degrees c with 5% co2 in m199 medium with 10% autologous serum. the different lps solutions were added to the wells on day 5. after 4 h the supernatants were collected and quantitatively assayed for tnf-alpha using a commercial elisa kit. statistical analysis was performed with anova. results indicated that ca(oh)2 is able to eliminate the ability of an e. coli lps to stimulate tnf-alpha production in peripheral blood monocytes (p < 0.0001).

@background linking root morphology, longevity and function to root branch order: a case study in three shrubs we used minirhizotrons to determine patterns of root longevity andturnover for the perennial bunchgrass bouteloua gracilisinthe shortgrass steppe of eastern colorado, usa. we hypothesized that rootlongevity would be partially controlled by root diameter, following previouslyobserved patterns in woody plants. in addition, we hypothesized that rootturnover would be greatest in surface soil horizons and decrease with depth dueto variation in soil moisture availability and temperature. root longevity wascorrelated with root diameter. median life span of roots > 0.4mm was approximately 320 days, while roots < 0.2mmhad a median life span of 180 days. there was approximately a 6%decreasein the likelihood of mortality with a 0.10-mm increase inroot diameter, controlling for the effect of depth in the soil profile. rootlength production and mortality were highest in the upper20 cm of the soil profile and decreased with depth.however,because root length density also decreased with depth, there were nosignificantdifferences in turnover rate of root length among sampling intervals. turnoverwas approximately 0.86 yr−1 based on root length production,while turnover was 0.35 yr−1 using root length mortality as ameasurement of flux. the imbalance between turnover estimates may be aconsequence of the time the minirhizotrons were in place prior to imaging or mayresult from our lack of over-winter measures of mortality. our worksuggests that bouteloua gracilis roots have complex lifehistory strategies, similar to woody species. some portion of the root systemishighly ephemeral, while slightly larger roots persist much longer. thesedifferences have implications for belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles in theshortgrass steppe.

@method nano to micro — fluorescence measurements of electric fields in molecules and genetically specified neurons we constructed a novel optical indicator for chloride ions by fusing the chloride-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein with the chloride-insensitive cyan fluorescent protein. the ratio of fret-dependent emission of these fluorophores varied in proportion to the concentration of cl and was used to measure intracellular chloride concentration ([cl-]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons. [cl-]i decreased during neuronal development, consistent with the shift from excitation to inhibition during maturation of gabaergic synapses. focal activation of gabaa receptors caused large changes in [cl-]i that could underlie use-dependent depression of gaba-dependent synaptic transmission. gaba-induced changes in somatic [cl-]i spread into dendrites, suggesting that [cl-]i can signal the location of synaptic activity. this genetically encoded indicator will permit new approaches ranging from high-throughput drug screening to direct recordings of synaptic cl- signals in vivo.
@result service utilization by hospitalized suicide attempters with schizophrenia or depression in montreal. utilization of health care services has been found to differ between psychiatric disorders. however, the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with mental disorders is not known. this study systematically investigated the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum versus mood disorders with or without comorbid substance use disorders both before and after attempted suicide. all consecutive medically treated suicide attempters in helsinki from january 15, 1997, to january 14, 1998, were identified (n = 1,198). data were gathered on all their health care contacts within the 12 months before and after the index attempt. whereas the clear majority of all suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders had a treatment contact during the 30 days following the attempt, half of those with pure substance use disorders were without any contact with health care. comorbid substance use made treatment less likely after attempted suicide among both psychiatric disorder groups; those with schizophrenia spectrum and comorbid substance use disorders were seven times more often left without aftercare recommendation than those without substance use comorbidity. comorbid substance use disorders among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders decrease the likelihood of active aftercare, despite high suicide risk.
@background mammalian frataxin: an essential function for cellular viability through an interaction with a preformed iscu/nfs1/isd11 iron-sulfur assembly complex frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
@background nonlinear relationship of near-bed velocity and growth of riverbed periphyton current velocity is a pervasive feature of lotic systems, yet this defining environmental variable is rarely examined as a factor for regulating stream herbivory. to investigate how current modifies herbivory in the upper colorado river, u.s.a., loops of electrified fencing wire were used to reduce in situ grazer densities on 30 × 30 cm tile substrates. after 45 d, electrified tiles had significantly fewer grazers (p = 0.03) and >2x more algal biomass than controls (p = 0.0002). reduced grazing on electrified tiles yielded periphytic assemblages having more diatoms and chlorophytes, as well as greater algal species richness. current velocity effects alone did not significantly regulate algal abundance; however, the interaction between current velocity and grazer exclusion resulted in more algae in slow vs. fast current (p = 0.02). grazer abundances were similar between fast and slow current velocities, suggesting that grazers in the colorado river differ in their ability to regulate algae across the current velocity gradient. our results indicate that stream current-mediated herbivory in streams may be more important than is generally recognized.

@background mapping c-terminal transactivation domains of the nuclear her family receptor tyrosine kinase her3 purpose: the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) inhibitor gefitinib (iressa) has shown antitumor activity in clinical trials against cancers, such as non–small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). research on non–small cell lung cancer has elucidated factors that may predict response to gefitinib. less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in hnscc patients. experimental design: we analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the egfr/erbb receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established hnscc lines in vitro. ic50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. erbb signaling was assessed by western and real-time reverse transcription-pcr analyses of egfr, erbb2, erbb3, and erbb4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pegfr, perbb2, perbb3, pakt, and perk. egfr sequences encoding kinase domain and egfr gene copy numbers were determined by cdna sequencing and real-time pcr, respectively. finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-egfr antibody cetuximab (erbitux). results: expression levels of perbb2 (p = 0.02) and total erbb3 protein (p = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (omnitarg), an antibody targeting erbb2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant hnscc cell lines. the same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. in contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between egfr gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (p = 0.0498) and cetuximab (p = 0.053). no activating egfr mutations were identified. conclusions:egfr amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in hnscc. however, other egfr/erbb receptor family members than egfr may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. erbb2 and erbb3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of hnscc with gefitinib.
@background association of the mir-196a2, mir-146a, and mir-499 polymorphisms with asthma phenotypes in a korean population to identify proteins that might play an important role in allergen‐induced asthma, we analyzed lung extracts prepared from allergen (ovalbumin)‐challenged animals in a mouse model of this condition. the combination of two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that annexin‐1, a 37 kda anti‐inflammatory protein that inhibits the activity of cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2), was down‐regulated by allergen challenge in the lungs of ovalbumin‐sensitized mice. immunoblot analysis showed that this effect of ovalbumin challenge was attributable to proteolytic cleavage of annexin‐1. the ovalbumin‐induced degradation of annexin‐1 was blocked by pretreatment of mice with the antioxidant n‐acetylcysteine (nac) or with sodium selenite, both of which have previously been shown to exert anti‐inflammatory effects in this asthma model. ovalbumin challenge also both increased the expression of cpla2 in lung tissue and reduced the extent of the interaction between cpla2 and annexin‐1, and these effects were inhibited by nac or selenite. moreover, the concentrations of cysteinyl leukotrienes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of leukotriene b4 in lung tissue were increased by ovalbumin challenge in a nac‐ or selenite‐sensitive manner. together, these results suggest that allergen‐induced oxidative stress results in proteolysis of annexin‐1 and consequent up‐regulation of cpla2 activity and leukotriene production in this mouse model of asthma, and that the anti‐inflammatory effects of selenite may provide a basis for the development of new antiasthmatic drugs.
@background identification and chronological analysis of genomic signatures in influenza a viruses influenza a viruses may cross species barriers and transmit to humans with the potential to cause pandemics. interplay of human- (pb2 627k) and avian-like (pb2 627e) influenza polymerase complexes with unknown host factors have been postulated to play a key role in interspecies transmission. here, we have identified human importin-α isoforms (α1 and α7) as positive regulators of human- but not avian-like polymerase activity. human-like polymerase activity correlated with efficient recruitment of α1 and α7 to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vrnps) without affecting subcellular localization. we also observed that human-like influenza virus growth was impaired in α1 and α7 downregulated human lung cells. mice lacking α7 were less susceptible to human- but not avian-like influenza virus infection. thus, α1 and α7 are positive regulators of human-like polymerase activity and pathogenicity beyond their role in nuclear transport.
@method cyber and traditional bullying victimization as a risk factor for mental health problems and suicidal ideation in adolescents abstract. this study was a first attempt to examine the psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) in dutch youths. a large sample of normal children and adolescents (n = 562) and their parents completed the sdq along with a number of other psychopathology measures. factor analysis of the sdq yielded five factors that were in keeping with the hypothesised subscales of hyperactivity-inattention, emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, and prosocial behaviour. furthermore, internal consistency, test-retest stability, and parent-youth agreement of the various sdq scales were acceptable. finally, the concurrent validity of the sdq was good: that is, its scores correlated in a theoretically meaningful way with other measures of psychopathology. it can be concluded that the psychometric properties of the parent- and self-report version of the sdq were satisfactory in this dutch community sample. moreover, the current data provide further support for the utility of the sdq as an index of psychopathological symptoms in youths.
@result selection of normal spermatozoa with a vacuole‐free head (x6300) improves selection of spermatozoa with intact dna in patients with high sperm dna fragmentation rates purposewe used computer assisted sperm selection (msome) during cycles of intracytoplasmic sperm injection to test whether this technique improves results over traditional icsi protocols. we also used the tunel assay to test whether msome could deselect physiologically abnormal spermatozoa.methodsindividual spermatozoa were examined with msome. normal and abnormal spermatozoa were tested for the level of dna fragmentation using tunel assay. in a prospective, randomized trial, patients were selected for standard icsi, or imsi techniques. we tested the two groups for biological and clinical parameters.results64.8% of spermatozoa, otherwise selectable for icsi, were characterized by abnormalities after computer-assisted sperm analysis. these sperm were also characterized by an increase in the level of dna fragmentation. we noted an increase in embryo quality, pregnancy and implantation rates after computerized sperm selection during icsi procedures.conclusionscomputerised selection of spermatozoa during icsi procedures deselects physiological abnormal spermatozoa and improves clinical results.
@background enriched transcription factor signatures in triple negative breast cancer indicates possible targeted therapies with existing drugs we have identified and cloned a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily from murine testis, referred to as retinoid receptor-related testis-associated receptor or rtr. degenerate pcr primers homologous to two conserved regions of the dna-binding domain of members of this superfamily were employed to identify this gene. the amino-acid sequence of rtr is most closely related to that of the mouse rxrs with an overall identity of 32-34%; the highest similarity (61%) is observed in the dna-binding domain. northern blot analysis using rna from multiple tissues showed that rtr is predominantly expressed in the testis. northern blot analysis using rna from different testicular cell types showed that rtr mrna is not expressed in early germ cells or sertoli cells but is most abundant in round spermatids. our observations suggest that this putative transcription factor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression particularly during the post-meiotic phase of spermatogenesis.
@method estimation of inertial/magnetic sensor orientation for human-motion-capture system this paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. a nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. the raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. the airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full gps/ins that was available for the data set.
@background de novo transcriptome of the hemimetabolous german cockroach (blattella germanica) insect os-d-like proteins, also known as chemosensory (csp) or sensory appendage proteins (sap), are broadly expressed in various insect tissues, where they are thought to bind short to medium chain length fatty acids and their derivatives. although their specific function remains uncertain, os-d-like members have been isolated from sensory organs (including the sensillum lymph in some cases), and a role in olfaction similar to that of the insect odorant binding proteins (obp) has been suggested for some. we have identified 15 new os-d-like sequences: four from cdna clones described herein and 11 from sequence databases. the os-d-like genes from the anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera, drosophila melanogaster, and drosophila pseudoobscura genomes typically have single, small introns with a conserved splice site. together with all family members entered on genbank, a total of 70 os-d-like proteins, representing the insect orders diptera, dictyoptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera, orthoptera, and phasmatodea, were analyzed. a neighbor joining distance phenogram identified several protein similarity classes that were characterized by highly conserved sequence motifs, including (a) n-terminal yttkydn(v/i)(n/d)(l/v)deil, (b) central dgkelkxx(i/l)pdal, and (c) c-terminal kydp. in contrast, three similarity classes were characterized by their diversion from these conserved motifs. the functional importance of conserved amino acid residues is discussed in relation to the crystal and nmr structures of mbracspa6.
@method genomic analyses of francisella tularensis strains confirm disease transmission from drinking water sources, turkey, 2008, 2009 and 2012. tularemia is an endemic disease in turkey. in this study, we aimed to detect francisella tularensis by two methods from natural water supplies thought to cause tularemia epidemiologically. a total of 154 water specimens from three different outbreaks caused by drinking water were collected. water specimens were cultured on antibiotic-added cysteine heart agar base with blood and incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 for 4–10 days. the suspected colonies were confirmed by f. tularensis antiserum (bd) and the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. dna was isolated from samples obtained from filters. the primer and probe sets targeting the isftu2 genome were used. a total of four f. tularensis isolates were obtained from 154 water samples. at the same time, the presence of f. tularensis dna from 17 water specimens was shown by the real-time taqman pcr method. although the dna presence of f. tularensis has been detected from water sources by the pcr method in turkey up to now, there has been no isolation directly from water specimens by culture. in this study, the determination of f. tularensis from water sources has been exhibited as the first data by both culture and real-time taqman pcr methods.
@background comparison of the effect of the trendelenburg and passive leg raising positions on internal jugular vein size in critically ill patients. background the trendelenburg position is used to distend the central veins, improving both the success and safety of vascular cannulation. the purpose of this study was to measure the cross-sectional area (csa) of the internal jugular vein (ijv) in three different positions using surface ultrasonography.   methods fifty-one subjects were enrolled. a sono site titan 180 or m-turbo portable ultrasound machine with a 10.5-mhz broadband linear surface probe was used. we measured the csa of the ijv (at end-expiration at the level of the cricoid cartilage) in three positions: 15° reverse trendelenburg, supine, and 15° trendelenburg.   results the mean csa at 15° reverse trendelenburg was 0.83 cm2 (sd, 0.86), in the supine position it was 1.25 cm2 (sd, 0.98), and at -15° trendelenburg it was 1.47 cm2 (sd, 1.03). moving from reverse trendelenburg to supine, the csa increased by 50%. in contrast, lowering the head to a trendelenburg position increased the mean csa by only 17%. surprisingly, trendelenburg positioning reduced the csa in nine of the 51 subjects.   conclusions trendelenburg positioning augments the csa only modestly, on average, compared with the supine position, and in some patients it reduces the csa.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov; no.: nct01099254; url: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
@background towards a new isolation abstraction for osgi to date, systems offering multitasking for the javatm programming language either use one process or one class loader for each application. both approaches are unsatisfactory. using operating system processes is expensive, scales poorly and does not fully exploit the protection features inherent in a safe language. class loaders replicate application code, obscure the type system, and non-uniformly treat ‘trusted’ and ‘untrusted’ classes, which leads to subtle, but nevertheless, potentially harmful forms of undesirable inter-application interaction. in this paper we propose a novel, simple yet powerful solution. the new model improves on existing designs in terms of resource utilization while offering strong isolation among applications. the approach is applicable both on high-end servers and on small devices. the main idea is to maintain only one copy of every class, regardless of how many applications use it. classes are transparently and automatically modified, so that each application has a separate copy of its static fields. two prototypes are described and selected performance data is analyzed. various aspects of the proposed architectural changes to the java virtual machine are discussed.
@background this information is current as complement receptor cr 1 require expression of the mouse and t-dependent antibody responses optimal germinal center b cell activation affinity maturation of the humoral immune response by somatic hypermutation is marked by a rapid and dramatic increase in affinity for the eliciting antigen. we suggest that the optimal mutation schedule is one in which periods of rapid mutation alternate with periods of mutation-free growth. the multicompartmental structure of the germinal center, together with re-entry of positively selected b cells back into the germinal center, will naturally implement such a schedule, thereby providing an anatomical basis for the efficiency of the germinal center reaction.

@background lower incidence of hypo-magnesemia in surgical intensive care unit patients in 2011 versus 2001 magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia remain quite prevalent, particularly in patients in intensive care units, and may have important clinical consequences. magnesium should be measured directly in clinical circumstances in which a risk for magnesium deficiency exists and appropriately corrected when found. this commentary reviews the current knowledge of magnesium homeostasis and the risk factors and clinical consequences of magnesium deficiency and outlines approaches to therapy.
@method the measurement of information transmitted by a neural population: promises and challenges information theory started and, according to some, ended with shannon’s seminal paper “a mathematical theory of communication” (shannon 1948). because its significance and flexibility were quickly recognized, there were numerous attempts to apply it to diverse fields outside of its original scope. this prompted shannon to write his famous essay “the bandwagon” (shannon 1956), warning against indiscriminate use of the new tool. nevertheless, non-standard applications of information theory persisted.    very soon after shannon’s initial publication (shannon 1948), several manuscripts provided the foundations of much of the current use of information theory in neuroscience. mackay and mcculloch (1952) applied the concept of information to propose limits of the transmission capacity of a nerve cell. this work foreshadowed future work on what can be termed “neural information flow”—how much information moves through the nervous system, and the constraints that information theory imposes on the capabilities of neural systems for communication, computation and behavior. a second set of manuscripts, by attneave (1954) and barlow (1961), discussed information as a constraint on neural system structure and function, proposing that neural structure in sensory system is matched to statistical structure of the sensory environment, in a way to optimize information transmission. this is the main idea behind the “structure from information” line of research that is still very active today. a third thread, “reliable computation with noisy/faulty elements”, started both in the information-theoretic community (shannon and mccarthy 1956) and neuro-science (winograd and cowan 1963). with the advent of integrated circuits that were essentially faultless, interest began to wane. however, as ic technology continues to push towards smaller and faster computational elements (even at the expense of reliability), and as neuromorphic systems are developed with variability designed in (merolla and boahen 2006), this topic is gaining in popularity again in the electronics community, and neuroscientists again may have something to contribute to the discussion.
@method resistance of differentiated human airway epithelium to infection by rhinovirus. comprehensive and systematic analysis of airway gene expression represents a strategy for addressing the multiple, complex, and largely untested hypotheses that exist for disease mechanisms, including asthma. here, we report a novel real-time pcr-based method specifically designed for quantification of multiple low-abundance transcripts using as little as 2.5 fg of total rna per gene. this method of gene expression profiling has the same specificity and sensitivity as rt-pcr and a throughput level comparable to low-density dna microarray hybridization. in this two-step method, multiplex rt-pcr is successfully combined with individual gene quantification via real-time pcr on generated cdna product. using this method, we measured the expression of 75 genes in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic versus healthy subjects and found expected increases in expression levels of th2 cytokines and their receptors in asthma. surprisingly, we also found increased gene expression of nkcc1--a na+-k+-cl- cotransporter. using immunohistochemical method, we confirmed increased protein expression for nkcc1 in the asthmatic subject with restricted localization to goblet cells. these data validate the new transcriptional profiling method and implicate nkcc1 in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion in asthma. potential applications for this method include transcriptional profiling in limited numbers of laser captured cells and validation of dna microarray data in clinical specimens.

@background a stochastic mathematical model of the within-herd transmission dynamics of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv): fade-out and persistence. the aim of this study was to determine whether porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) could be transmitted by aerosol under field conditions. a total of 210 five-month-old prrsv-negative pigs were housed in a mechanically ventilated finishing facility containing 11 pens. pen 1 contained 10 pigs (indirect contact controls) and pen 2 remained empty, providing a barrier of 2.5 m from the remaining pigs in pens 3 to 11. fifteen or 16 of the pigs in each of pens 3 to 11 were infected experimentally with a field isolate of prrsv and the other six or seven pigs served as direct contact controls. five days after the pigs were infected, two trailers containing 10 five-week-old prrsv-naive sentinel pigs were placed along each side of the building; one was placed 1 m from the exhaust fans on one side of the building, and the other was placed 30 m from the fans on the other side, and the sentinel pigs remained in the trailers for 72 hours. they were then moved to separate buildings on the same site, 30 and 80 m, respectively, from the infected barn, and their prrsv status was monitored for 21 days. the direct and indirect contact control pigs became infected with prrsv but the sentinel pigs did not.
@background differential effect of methyl‐, butyl‐ and propylparaben and 17β‐estradiol on selected cell cycle and apoptosis gene and protein expression in mcf‐7 breast cancer cells and mcf‐10a non‐malignant cells backgroundwidely accepted somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis states that mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in genomes of somatic cells is the cause of neoplastic transformation. identifying frequent mutations in cancer cells suggests the involvement of mutant genes in carcinogenesis.resultsto develop an in vitro model for the analysis of genetic alterations associated with breast carcinogenesis, we used random mutagenesis and selection of human non-tumorigenic immortalized breast epithelial cells mcf-10a in tissue-culture conditions that mimic tumor environment. random mutations were generated in mcf-10a cells by cultivating them in a tissue-culture medium containing the frameshift-inducing agent icr191. the first selective condition we used to transform mcf1-10a cells was cultivation in a medium containing mutagen at a concentration that allowed cell replication despite p53 protein accumulation induced by mutagen treatment. the second step of selection was either cell cultivation in a medium with reduced growth-factor supply or in a medium that mimics a hypoxia condition or growing in soft agar. using mutagenesis and selection, we have generated several independently derived cultures with various degrees of transformation. gene identification by nonsense-mediated mrna decay inhibition (gini) analysis has identified the icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the tp53, smoothelin, ras association (ralgds/af-6) domain family 6 (rassf6) and other genes in the transformed mcf-10a cells. the tp53 gene mutations resulting in the loss of protein expression had been found in all independently transformed mcf-10a cultures, which form large progressively growing tumors with sustained angiogenesis in nude mice.conclusionidentifying genes containing bi-allelic icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the transformed mcf-10a cells generated by random mutagenesis and selection indicates putative breast-tumor suppressors. this can provide a model for studying the role of mutant genes in breast carcinogenesis.
@background comparison of 4 direct coombs' test methods with polyclonal antiglobulins in anemic and nonanemic dogs for in‐clinic or laboratory use the coombs' test can detect both immunoglobulin and complement on the surface of rbcs, and as such can be of value as an aid in the diagnosis of imha. techniques that may improve sensitivity include use of monovalent reagents, increased dilutions of antiglobulin to avoid a prozone effect, and testing at 4°c. these techniques are not without controversy, and positive tests should always be interpreted in the presence of other clinical and hematologic evidence for imha. alternate techniques, such as flow cytometry, can improve detection of rbc-bound immunoglobulin, but require a flow cytometer and further standardization between laboratories.
@background isozyme-specific ligands for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, a novel antibiotic target abstract the bifunctional protein complex, cysteine synthetase, in salmonella typhimurium is composed of the enzymes serine transacetylase and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. a point mutation (bb1) in the structural gene for serine transacetylase results in diminished catalytic activity of both components of the complex. enzyme inactivation studies using either specific o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase antiserum or heat show that the isolated o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of the mutant are indistinguishable from wild type o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase. when o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from either wild type or mutant source is combined with serine transacetylase from a common source, their behavior is identical as measured by decrement in enzymic activity, immunological inactivation, and heat inactivation. thus, when hybrid cysteine synthetases, composed of one component from the wild type and one from the mutant, are investigated, the o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of such hybrid complexes behave like those found in the native cysteine synthetase from which the serine transacetylase component was derived. these studies establish that the diminished catalytic activity of the sulfhydrylase of the mutant results from the association of catalytically normal o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase with mutant serine transacetylase. the basis of the pleiotropic phenotype of mutant bb1 is, therefore, an alteration in protein-protein interaction resulting from a structural gene mutation.
@background cognitive predictors of treatment response to bupropion and cognitive effects of bupropion in patients with major depressive disorder this was a 4-week, three-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy and safety of bupropion in hospitalized depressed patients. results from 27 placebo and 48 bupropion-treated patients were analyzed for efficacy and safety. assessments of efficacy and safety were made at baseline and weekly during the study. primary and secondary measures of efficacy included the clinical global impressions for severity (cgi-s) and improvement (cgi-i) of illness, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales, and the zung self-rating scales for depression and anxiety. assessments of safety included vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse experiences. dosages of bupropion were 300–600 mg/day. results showed that bupropion was significantly (p<0.01) more effective than placebo at termination of study on the cgi-s, cgi-i, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales. on the zung self-rating depression and anxiety scales, statistical trends favored bupropion at termination of study over placebo (p<0.10). adverse events in the bupropion and placebo groups were minimal with notable absence of sedation and anticholinergic-and cardiovascular-related side effects. we conclude that bupropion was significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression and accompanying anxiety in depressed inpatients.
@background high cd10 expression predicts favorable outcome in surgically treated lymph node-positive bladder cancer patients. we tested 505 cases of nonhematopoietic neoplasms by immunohistochemistry using a newly characterized monoclonal antibody (clone 56c6) against the cd10 antigen. cd10 was expressed widely in neoplasms of the genitourinary tract, including 41 (89%) of 46 cases of renal cell carcinoma, 13 (54%) of 24 cases of transitional cell carcinoma, and 11 (61%) of 18 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma. in addition, 5 (100%) of 5 endometrial stromal sarcomas, 3 (60%) of 5 rhabdomyosarcomas, 7 (50%) of 14 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 5 (45%) of 11 cases of schwannoma, and 12 (40%) of 30 cases of malignant melanoma also were positive for cd10. similar to normal tissue, cd10 positivity was restricted to the apical surface of malignant glandular cells of well-differentiated colonic, pancreatic, and prostatic adenocarcinoma, whereas in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and other tumors, such as melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma, the cd10 positivity showed diffuse cytoplasmic or membranous/golgi patterns. the monoclonal antibody clone 56c6 is a reliable marker for cd10 in paraffin immunohistochemistry after heat-induced epitope retrieval. cd10 expression in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma may be a useful marker in the differential diagnoses of these tumors because both tumors otherwise lack specific markers.
@background the expansion of heterochromatin blocks in rye reflects the co-amplification of tandem repeats and adjacent transposable elements bare-1 is a highly abundant, copia-like, ltr (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon in the genus hordeum. the ltrs provide the promoter, terminator, and polyadenylation signals necessary for the replicational life cycle of retrotransposons. we have examined the variability and evolution of bare-1-like elements, focusing on the ltrs. three groups were found, corresponding to each of the hordeum genome types analyzed, which predate the divergence of these types. the most variable ltr regions are tandem repeats near the 3′ end and the promoter. in barley (h. vulgare l.), two main classes of ltr promoters were defined, corresponding to bare-1 and to a new class we call bare-2. these can be considered as families within the group i bare elements. although less abundant in cultivated barley than is bare-1, bare-2 is transcriptionally active in leaves and calli. a sequenced bare-2 has more than 99% similar ltrs and perfect terminal direct repeats (tdrs), indicating it is a recent insertion, but the coding region, especially gag, is disrupted by frameshifts and stop codons. bare-2 appears to be a chimeric element resulting from retrotransposon recombination by strand switching during replication, with ltrs and 5′utr more similar to bare-1 and the rest more similar to wis-2. we provide evidence as well for another form of recombination, where ltr-ltr recombination has generated tandem multimeric bare-1 elements in which internal coding domains are interspersed with shared ltrs. the data indicate that recombination contributes to the complexity and plasticity of retroelement evolution in plant genomes.
@background low cholesterol is associated with depression among us household population. primary prevention trials which have shown that the lowering of serum cholesterol concentrations in middle-aged subjects by diet, drugs, or both leads to a decrease in coronary heart disease have also reported an increase in deaths due to suicide or violence. there has been no adequate explanation for this association. i have reviewed the relevant published work and describe a physiological mechanism that might account for this curious finding. one of the functions of serotonin in the central nervous system is the suppression of harmful behavioural impulses. when mouse brain synaptosomal membrane cholesterol is increased there is a pronounced increase in the number of serotonin receptors. low membrane cholesterol decreases the number of serotonin receptors. since membrane cholesterol exchanges freely with cholesterol in the surrounding medium, a lowered serum cholesterol concentration may contribute to a decrease in brain serotonin, with poorer suppression of aggressive behaviour.
@result zero erucic acid trait of rapeseed (brassica napus l.) results from a deletion of four base pairs in the fatty acid elongase 1 gene genomic fatty acid elongation 1 (fae1) clones from high erucic acid (hea) brassica napus, brassica rapa and brassica oleracea, and low erucic acid (lea) b. napus cv. westar, were amplified by pcr and expressed in yeast cells under the control of the strong galactose-inducible promoter. as expected, yeast cells expressing the fae1 genes from hea brassica spp. synthesized very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids that are not normally found in yeast, while fatty acid profiles of yeast cells expressing the fae1 gene from lea b. napus were identical to control yeast samples. in agreement with published findings regarding different hea and lea b. napus cultivars, comparison of fae1 protein sequences from hea and lea brassicaceae revealed one crucial amino acid difference: the serine residue at position 282 of the hea fae1 sequences is substituted by phenylalanine in lea b. napus cv. westar. using site directed mutagenesis, the phenylalanine 282 residue was substituted with a serine residue in the fae1 polypeptide from b. napus cv. westar, the mutated gene was expressed in yeast and gc analysis revealed the presence of very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids (vlcmfas), indicating that the elongase activity was restored in the lea fae1 enzyme by the single amino acid substitution. thus, for the first time, the low erucic acid trait in canola b. napus can be attributed to a single amino acid substitution which prevents the biosynthesis of the eicosenoic and erucic acids.

@result lyophilization to improve drug delivery for chitosan-calcium phosphate bone scaffold construct: a preliminary investigation. our contemporary understanding of bone healing has evolved due to knowledge gleaned from a continuous interaction between basic laboratory investigations and clinical observations following procedures to augment healing of fractures, osseous defects, and unstable joints. the stages of bone healing parallel the early stages of bone development. the bone healing process is greatly influenced by a variety of systemic and local factors. a thorough understanding of the basic science of bone healing as well as the many factors that can affect it is critical to the management of a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. in particular, the evolving management of spinal disorders can greatly benefit from the advancement of our understanding of the principles of bone healing.
@method expression profiling of the rpe in zebrafish smarca4 mutant revealed altered signals that potentially affect rpe and retinal differentiation zebrafish with the young (yng) mutation show a defect in retinal cell differentiation. here we demonstrate that a mutation in a brahma-related gene (brg1) is responsible for the yng phenotype. brahma homologues function as essential subunits for swi/snf-type chromatin remodeling complexes. our analysis indicates that brg1 is required for the wave of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity that precedes retinal cell differentiation. using specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway we show this signal has a direct role in retinal cell differentiation. lastly, through investigations of mutants in other chromatin remodeling subunits, we provide genetic evidence for gene and tissue specificity of the brahma chromatin remodeling complex.
@background protein synthesis and protein phosphorylation during heat stress, recovery, and adaptation heat shock at 45 degrees c virtually abolishes protein synthesis in hela cells, but return to 37 degrees c effects a complete recovery and the concomitant synthesis of heat shock-induced proteins. heat shock induces polysome disaggregation, indicating initiation is principally inhibited. in vitro assays for initiation factor activities reveal heat shock inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eif-2), eif-(3 + 4f), and eif-4b. immunoblot analyses show that eif-2 alpha and eif-2 beta become modified during heat shock, and eif-4b variants disappear. upon return to 37 degrees c, these alterations reverse. the modifications of eif-2 alpha and eif-4b are due to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. enzymatic activities induced by heat shock inhibit protein synthesis and modify initiation factors in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. initiation factor modifications may contribute to, or cause, protein synthesis inhibition.
@result cytoplasmic condensation is both necessary and sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death a common event that occurs during apoptosis is a loss of cell volume, but little information is available on its role in the cell death process. lymphocytes undergo apoptosis in response to glucocorticoids and exhibit cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, internucleosomal dna fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. interestingly, only cells that exhibit a loss in cell volume degrade their dna. to determine if physical shrinkage was sufficient to initiate apoptosis, s49 neo lymphocytes were cultured in hypertonic medium. the normal osmolarity (approximately 300 mosm) of tissue culture medium was increased to either 550 or 800 mosm, using impermeant sugars such as mannitol and sucrose or nacl. these hypertonic conditions led to a rapid killing of s49 neo cells. evaluation of the mode of cell death revealed that these hypertonic conditions resulted in apoptosis. unlike glucocorticoid-induced cell death, hypertonically induced apoptosis did not require protein synthesis. when s49 neo cells were cultured under hypotonic conditions, the cells swelled but apoptosis did not occur. analysis of several cell types revealed that all lymphoid cells examined (s49 neo, cem-c7, primary thymocytes) undergo apoptosis in response to hypertonic conditions, whereas several other cell types (l cells, cos, hela, gh3) did not. although these nonlymphoid cells showed a similar initial reduction in cell volume in response to hypertonic conditions, they subsequently maintained volume or regulated back to a near normal cell volume. these data indicate that thymic lymphoid cells have the machinery in place for rapid induction of apoptosis in response to physical shrinkage, whereas other cell types resist shrinkage-induced apoptosis by the activation of cell volume regulatory mechanisms.
@background transcriptional profiling reveals a role for roralpha in regulating gene expression in obesity-associated inflammation and hepatic steatosis. homozygous staggerermice (sg/sg) display decreased anddysfunctional retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ror ) expression.we observed decreases in serum (and liver) triglycerides and total and high density lipoprotein serum cholesterol in sg/sgmice. moreover, the sg/sgmice were characterized by reduced adiposity (associated with decreased fat pad mass and adipocyte size). candidate-based expression profiling demonstrated that the dyslipidemia in sg/sg mice is associated with decreased hepatic expression of srebp-1c, and the reverse cholesterol transporters,abca1 andabcg1. this is consistent with the reduced serum lipids. the molecular mechanism did not involve aberrant expression of lxr and/or chrebp. however, chip and transfection analyses revealed that ror is recruited to and regulates the activity of the srebp-1c promoter. furthermore, the lean phenotype in sg/sg mice is also characterized by significantly increased expression of pgc-1 , pgc-1 , and lipin1mrna in liver andwhite andbrownadipose tissue from sg/sg mice. in addition, we observed a significant 4-fold increase in 2-adrenergic receptor mrna in brown adipose tissue. finally, dysfunctional ror expression protects against diet-induced obesity. following a 10-week high fat diet, wild-type but not sg/sg mice exhibited a 20% weight gain, increased hepatic triglycerides, and notable white and brown adipose tissue accumulation. in summary, these changes in gene expression (that modulate lipid homeostasis) in metabolic tissues are involved in decreased adiposity and resistance to dietinduced obesity in the sg/sg mice, despite hyperphagia. in conclusion, we suggest this orphan nuclear receptor is a key modulator of fat accumulation and that selective ror modulators may have utility in the treatment of obesity.
@method identifying key factors of student academic performance by subgroup discovery this paper presents an overview on the vikamine system for subgroup discovery, pattern mining and analytics. as of vikamine version 2, it is implemented as rich-client platform (rcp) application, based on the eclipse framework. this provides for a highly-configurable environment, and allows modular extensions using plugins. we present the system, briefly discuss exemplary plugins, and provide a sketch of successful applications.
@background effect of gastric acidification on the (14)c-ubt heliprobe(®) accuracy during pantoprazole treatment in helicobacter pylori positive patients. background/aims omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, has an antibacterial effect against helicobacter pylori at neutral ph and inhibits its urease activity. the aim of this study was to characterize h. pylori acid resistance and to determine whether omeprazole effects its survival at low ph.   methods we studied survival of h. pylori and other enteric organisms in buffered solutions (ph 2-7) in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/l urea and/or omeprazole.   results in the absence of urea, the acid tolerances of wild-type h. pylori, a urease-negative h. pylori mutant, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were similar. in the presence of urea, the survival of the wild-type h. pylori at ph 2 was significantly greater than that of the other organisms. omeprazole (100 micrograms/ml) had a marked inhibitory effect on the survival of both wild-type and urease-negative h. pylori at low ph, and similar effects on e. coli, p. mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium.   conclusions whereas survival of h. pylori below ph 4 is urease dependent, h. pylori uses non-urease-mediated mechanisms at or above ph 4. omeprazole inhibits the survival of h. pylori at low ph through a mechanism independent of its effect on urease, an antibacterial effect that extends to other enteric bacteria.
@result cell-penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers: effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. in the specific case of hiv-1, this subunit is the basic domain tat(49-57) (rkkrrqrrr). to establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. all truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. in contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (r9) was 20-fold more efficient than tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by michaelis-menton kinetic analysis. the d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (n-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to tat(49-57) and even to r9. overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared.
@method sense of coherence and self-sacrificing defense style as predictors of psychological distress and quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis: a 5-year prospective study background the defense style questionnaire (dsq) was designed to assess behavior indicative of conscious derivatives of defensive styles. this study aimed to assess the factor structure and the main psychometric properties of its greek version in 3 different samples.   methods the dsq-88 was translated into greek using back-translation, and it was administered to 2308 participants (984 healthy subjects, 1084 medical patients, and 240 psychiatric patients). exploratory factor analyses were performed; symptom distress checklist-90-r and minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (mmpi) ego strength scales were administered for testing criterion and concurrent validity, followed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis.   results four factors were identified, largely corresponding to the original version's maladaptive, image-distorting, self-sacrificing, and adaptive styles, showing a remarkable stability in all 3 samples. adaptive style was positively correlated to ego strength, whereas maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing styles were negatively correlated, in descending order. this, along with the intercorrelations observed between the 4 styles, provides evidence that this version supports the hierarchical organization of defensive functioning. test-retest reliabilities were adequate for all styles (r(1i)'s = 0.88, 0.81, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively). internal consistencies were satisfactory for maladaptive style (0.82), sufficient for self-sacrificing (0.76), and rather low for image-distorting (0.68) and adaptive (0.66) styles. maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing-but not adaptive-styles could differentiate nonpatients from psychiatric patients. maladaptive style was positively and adaptive style was negatively independently associated with psychological distress.   conclusions the present findings support the applicability of the greek version of dsq-88 within the greek population. future studies could improve its psychometric properties by finding new items for image-distorting and, especially, adaptive styles.
@background but affirmative action hurts us! race-related beliefs shape perceptions of white disadvantage and policy unfairness the present experiments suggest that the desire to benefit the in-group drives dominant-group members' policy preferences, independent of concern for out-groups' outcomes. in experiment 1, the effect of a manipulation of affirmative action procedures on policy support was mediated by how whites expected the policy to affect fellow whites, but not by the expected effect on minorities. in experiments 2 and 3, when focused on losses for the white in-group, whites' racial identity was negatively related to support for affirmative action. however, when focused on gains for the black out-group or when participants were told that whites were not affected by the policy, racial identity did not predict attitudes toward the policy. in experiments 2 and 3, perceived fairness mediated these effects.
@method efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three regimens for prevention of malaria: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in ugandan schoolchildren abstract key parasite polymorphisms were assessed in subjects treated for malaria with artesunate-amodiaquine in tororo, uganda. for pfcrt, all of the isolates tested had the cviet haplotype. for pfmdr1, 86y and 1246y were common at baseline and their prevalences were significantly higher in new isolates after therapy, indicating that treatment selected for mutations associated with a decreased response to amodiaquine.
@background the male role in pregnancy loss and embryo implantation failure pregnancy establishment and maintenance represents a challenge for the maternal immune system because it has to be alert against pathogens while tolerating paternal alloantigens expressed in fetal structures. regulatory t cells (tregs) are important for successful implantation and involved in allotolerance towards paternal antigens. the origin and mechanisms leading to treg generation during pregnancy at different stages remain under discussion. we report an accumulation of helios(+) tregs in thymus and in the lymph nodes draining the uterus at early pregnancy. at later pregnancy stages an expanded population of foxp3(+) tregs was generated in the periphery as we showed in a rag-1(-/-) model of cell transfer. our data suggest that tregs, predominantly of thymic origin, are needed for pregnancy establishment. at later pregnancy stages an extra thymic treg population contributes to the treg pool in the periphery. our data provides new insights in the origin of tregs during pregnancy that are essential to understand natural mechanisms of tolerance acquisition.
@background epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation via suppression of rela acetylation. ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
@background laminin-chitosan-plga conduit co-transplanted with schwann and neural stem cells to repair the injured recurrent laryngeal nerve a number of surprising observations have shown that stem cells, in suitable conditions, have the ability to produce a whole spectrum of cell types, regardless, whether these tissues are derived from the same germ layer or not. this phenomenon is called stem cell plasticity, which means that tissue-specific stem cells are mutually interchangeable. in our experiments, as a model, we used neural stem cells (nscs) harvested from fetal (e14-15) neocortex and beta-galactosidase positive. in the first experiment we found that on days 12 and 30 after sub-lethal irradiation (ld 8.5 gy) and (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs transplantation all mice survived, just as the group with bone marrow transplantation. moreover, the bone marrow of mice transplanted nscs contained the number of cfu-gm colonies with beta-galactosidase(+) cells which was as much as 50% higher. these differences were statistically significant, p<0.001. in the second experiment, we studied kinetics of (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs after their transplantation to sub-lethally irradiated mice. histochemistry of tissues was performed on days 12 and 30 post-transplantation, and beta-galactosidase(+) cells were detected with the help of histochemical examination of removed tissues (lung, liver, spleen, thymus, and skeletal muscle). in tissues removed on day 12 post-transplantation, we found a significantly higher number of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen and thymus on day 30. while we presumed the presence beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen, as spleen and reticuloendothelial system represent an important retaining system for different cell types, the presence of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the thymus was rather surprising but very interesting. this indicates a certain mutual and close interconnection of transplanted stem cells and immune system in an adult organism. in the third experiment, we verified the mutual interchange of sca-1 surface antigen in the bone marrow cells and nscs before transplantation. analysis of this antigen showed 24.8% sca-1 positive cells among the bone marrow cells, while nscs were sca-1 negative. our experiments show that nscs share hemopoietic identity and may significantly influence the recovery of damaged hematopoiesis but do not have typical superficial markers as hscs. this result is important for the determination of predictive factors for hemopoiesis recovery, for stem cell plasticity and for their use in the cell therapy.
@method transactions on data hiding and multimedia security x many illegal copies of digital video productions for cinema release can be found on the internet before their official release. during the illegal copying of cinema footage, composite geometric distortions commonly occur due to the angle of the camcorder relative to the screen. we propose a novel video watermarking based on spread spectrum way that satisfies the requirements for protecting digital cinema. it enables the detector to not only extract the embedded message but also estimate the position where the camcorder recording is made. it is sure that the proposed position estimating model (pem) can judge the seat in a theater with a mean absolute error (mae) of (33.84, 9.53, 50.38) cm. experimental results using various types of films show that the presented method provides the mathematical model for detecting and investigating the position of the pirate.
@background sti571 prevents apoptosis, tau phosphorylation and behavioural impairments induced by alzheimer's beta-amyloid deposits. here, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms that underlie the relative invulnerability of adult versus developing dorsal root ganglion (drg) sensory neurons. in culture, adult neurons were resistant to stimuli that caused apoptosis of their neonatal counterparts. in both adult and neonatal neurons, death stimuli induced the apoptotic c-jun n-terminal protein kinase (jnk) pathway, but jnk activation only caused death of neonatal neurons, indicating that adult neurons have a downstream block to apoptosis. expression of the dominant-inhibitory p53 family member, δnp73, rescued jnk-induced apoptosis of neonatal neurons, suggesting that it might participate in the downstream apoptotic block in adult neurons. to test this possibility, we examined adult drg neurons cultured from p73+/- mice. adult p73+/- drg neurons were more vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli than their p73+/+ counterparts, and invulnerability could be restored to the p73+/- neurons by increased expression of δnp73. moreover, although drg neuron development was normal in p73+/- animals in vivo, axotomy caused death of adult p73+/- but not p73+/+ drg neurons. thus, one way adult neurons become invulnerable is to enhance endogenous survival pathways, and one critical component of these survival pathways is p73.
@background comparison of radiological and morphologic assessments of myocardial bridges our purpose in this study was to investigate the perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges (mb) in dog, sheep, goat and human hearts. a total of 160 hearts were studied, and perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges was examined under microscope. the specimens belonged to 25 dogs, 100 sheep, 25 goats and 10 humans. special attention was paid to evaluate the distance between the mb and coronary arteries (ca), ca and underlying myocardium (um) and to find the relation of concomitant vein number accompanying the ca and mb. 219 myocardial bridges were found in total of hearts, and specimens from these bridges were examined under microscope. there were large variations in distance between the mb and ca (0–714 µm) and distance between ca and um (0–309 µm). the myocardial bridges were classified into three groups in terms of the number of veins accompanying ca, the bridges with no concomitant veins with one concomitant vein and with two concomitant veins. this suggests that the distance between the mb and ca is crucial to determine how much force is on the ca. the environment surrounding the ca may be a crucial factor in determining whether the mb influences the induction of heart disorders or not.
@background inadequate use of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in danish medical departments. perioperative antithrombotic clinical regimens have reduced the incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (dvt). long-term effects of asymptomatic postoperative dvt have been studied in a number of clinical trials and the present review describes the clinical significance of asymptomatic postoperative dvt regarding the possible development of postthrombotic syndrome (pts). we performed a systematic review of reference databases focusing upon studies including patients suspected of having postoperative dvt and reporting subsequent cases of pts at the end of a well-defined follow-up period. the included studies were stratified according to type of screening method and applied statistics. over-all evaluation included meta-analyses based upon the cochrane software package. the overall relative risk of developing pts was 1.58 (95% confidence intervals: 1.24-2.02) in patients suffering from asymptomatic dvt as compared to patients without dvt (p<0.0005). in conclusion, asymptomatic postoperative dvt is associated with an increased risk of late development of pts. the finding emphasizes that postoperative dvt, diagnosed by means of well-defined objective measures, remains the correct scientific endpoint in trials evaluating the efficacy of preoperative antithrombotic treatment regimens.
@background mutants lacking myosin ii cannot resist forces generated during multicellular morphogenesis. dictyostelium amebae have been engineered by homologous recombination of a truncated copy of the myosin heavy chain gene (heavy meromyosin (hmm) cells) and by transformation with a vector encoding an antisense rna to myosin heavy chain mrna (mhca cells) so that they lack native myosin heavy chain protein. in the former case, cells synthesize only the heavy meromyosin portion of the protein and in the latter case they synthesize negligible amounts of the protein. surprisingly, it was demonstrated that both cell lines are viable and motile. in order to compare the motility of these cells with normal cells, the newly developed computer-assisted dynamic morphology system (dms) was employed. the results demonstrate that the average hmm or mhca ameba moves at a rate of translocation less than half that of normal cells. it is rounder and less polar than a normal cell, and exhibits a rate of cytoplasmic expansion and contraction roughly half that of normal cells. in a spatial gradient of camp, the average ameba of hmm or mhca exhibits a chemotactic index of +0.10 or less, compared to the chemotactic index of +0.50 exhibited by normal cells. finally, the initial area, rate of expansion, and final area of pseudopods are roughly half that of normal cells. the five fastest hmm amebae (out of 35 analyzed in detail) moved at an average rate of translocation equal to that of normal amebae, and exhibited an average chemotactic index of +0.34. in addition, the average rate of cytoplasmic flow in fast hmm cells was equal to that of the average normal ameba. however, fast hmm amebae still exhibited the same defects in pseudopod formation that were exhibited by the entire hmm cell population. these results suggest that myosin heavy chain is involved in the "fine tuning" and efficiency of pseudopod formation, but is not essential for the basic behavior of pseudopod expansion.
@background evolution of a multigene family that encodes the kunitz chymotrypsin inhibitor in winged bean: a possible intermediate in the generation of a new gene with a distinct pattern of expression conversion between duplicated genes limits their independent evolution. models in which conversion frequencies decrease as genes diverge are examined to determine conditions under which genes can "escape" further conversion and hence escape from a gene family. a review of results from various recombination systems suggests two classes of sequence-dependence models: (1) the "k-hit" model in which conversion is completely inactivated by a few (k) mutational events, such as the insertion of a mobile element, and (2) more general models where conversion frequency gradually declines as genes diverge through the accumulation of point mutants. exact analysis of the k-hit model is given and an approximate analysis of a more general sequence-dependent model is developed and verified by computer simulation. if mu is the per nucleotide mutation rate, then neutral duplicated genes diverging through point mutants are likely to escape conversion provided 2 mu/lambda much greater than 0.1, where lambda is the conversion rate between identical genes. if 2 mu/lambda much less than 0.1, the expected number of conversions before escape increases exponentially so that, for biological purposes, the genes never escape conversion. for single mutational events sufficient to block further conversions, occurring at rate nu per copy per generation, many conversions are expected if 2 nu/lambda much less than 1, while the genes essentially evolve independently if 2 nu/lambda much greater than 1. implications of these results for both models of concerted evolution and the evolution of new gene functions via gene duplication are discussed.
@background a pooled analysis of body mass index and pancreatic cancer mortality in african americans overweight and obesity are health problems of epidemic proportions, increasing the risk not only of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus but also of various types of cancer. obesity is strongly associated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and altered secretion of adipokines. several of these factors, such as insulin resistance, increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and endogenous sex steroids, decreased levels of adiponectin, and chronic inflammation, are involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. this article reviews these mechanisms, focusing on adipose tissue dysfunction as a unifying causal factor. although understanding of the link between obesity and cancer might provide therapeutic targets, preventing overweight and obesity still remains number one priority.

@background hierarchical cluster visualization in web mapping systems information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. this data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. to help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. this paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. the aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.
@background a new look at care in pregnancy: simple, effective interventions for neglected populations background and objectives hookworm infection is among the major causes of anaemia in poor communities, but its importance in causing maternal anaemia is poorly understood, and this has hampered effective lobbying for the inclusion of anthelmintic treatment in maternal health packages. we sought to review existing evidence on the role of hookworm as a risk factor for anaemia among pregnant women. we also estimate the number of hookworm infections in pregnant women in sub-saharan africa (ssa). methods structured searches using medline and embase as well as manual searches of reference lists were conducted, and unpublished data were obtained by contacting authors. papers were independently reviewed by two authors, and relevant data were extracted. we compared haemoglobin concentration (hb) according to intensity of hookworm infection and calculated standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. to estimate the number of pregnant women, we used population surfaces and a spatial model of hookworm prevalence. findings one hundred and five reports were screened and 19 were eligible for inclusion: 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomised controlled trials, 2 non-randomised treatment trials and 2 observational studies. comparing uninfected women and women lightly (1–1,999 eggs/gram [epg]) infected with hookworm, the standardised mean difference (smd) was −0.24 (95% ci: −0.36 to −0.13). the smd between women heavily (4000+ epg) infected and those lightly infected was −0.57 (95% ci: −0.87 to −0.26). all identified intervention studies showed a benefit of deworming for maternal or child health, but since a variety of outcomes measures were employed, quantitative evaluation was not possible. we estimate that 37.7 million women of reproductive age in ssa are infected with hookworm in 2005 and that approximately 6.9 million pregnant women are infected. conclusions evidence indicates that increasing hookworm infection intensity is associated with lower haemoglobin levels in pregnant women in poor countries. there are insufficient data to quantify the benefits of deworming, and further studies are warranted. given that between a quarter and a third of pregnant women in ssa are infected with hookworm and at risk of preventable hookworm-related anaemia, efforts should be made to increase the coverage of anthelmintic treatment among pregnant women.
@background reduced gene expression of intestinal alpha-defensins predicts diarrhea in a cohort of african adults. to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
@method associations among parent acculturation, child bmi, and child fruit and vegetable consumption in a hispanic sample background few studies have examined the influence of country of birth and acculturation status on indicators of obesity using national samples of mexican-american women and men.   methods we analysed data for 1387 mexican-american women and 1404 mexican- american men, ages 25-64, from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-1994). we examined whether waist circumference and abdominal obesity varied by country of birth and acculturation status (primary language spoken), and whether among those with abdominal obesity, number of associated cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors varied by country of birth and acculturation status.   results both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation status were significantly associated with waist circumference and abdominal obesity. mexican-born women and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm respectively), us-born english-speaking women and men had intermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and us-born spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for age, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking. all women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly us-born spanish-speaking women (68.7%). in addition, us-born spanish-speaking women with abdominal obesity were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have one or more of the following cvd risk factors: high serum insulin, non-insulin dependent diabetes, high blood lipids, and/or hypertension.   conclusions these findings illustrate the heterogeneity of the mexican-american population and suggest that country of birth and lack of acculturation to the majority culture, as well as secondary lifestyle changes, may explain the significant clinical differences observed in abdominal obesity within mexican-american population subgroups.
@background isolation, characterization, and heterologous expression of the novel lantibiotic epicidin 280 and analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster lantibiotics form a group of modified peptides with unique structures, containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as dehydrated and lanthionine residues. in the gram-positive bacteria that secrete these lantibiotics, the gene clusters flanking the structural genes for various linear (type a) lantibiotics have recently been characterized. the best studied representatives are those of nisin (nis), subtilin (spa), epidermin (epi), pep5 (pep), cytolysin (cyl), lactocin s (las) and lacticin 481 (lct). comparison of the lantibiotic gene clusters shows that they contain conserved genes that probably encode similar functions.the nis, spa, epi and pep clusters contain lanb and lanc genes that are presumed to code for two types of enzymes that have been implicated in the modification reactions characteristic of all lantibiotics, i.e. dehydration and thio-ether ring formation. the cyl, las and lct gene clusters have no homologue of the lanb gene, but they do contain a much larger lanm gene that is the lanc gene homologue. most lantibiotic gene clusters contain a lanp gene encoding a serine protease that is presumably involved in the proteolytic processing of the prelantibiotics. all clusters contain a lant gene encoding and abc transporter likely to be involved in the export of (precursors of) the lantibiotics. the lane, lanf and lang genes in the nis, spa and epi clusters encode another transport system that is possibly involved in self-protection. in the nisin and subtilin gene clusters two tandem genes, lanr and lank, have been located that code for a two-component regulatory system.finally, non-homologous genes are found in some lantibiotic gene clusters. the nisl and spal genes encode lipoproteins that are involved in immunity, the pepi gene encodes a membrane-located immunity protein, and epid encodes an enzyme involved in a post-translational modification found only in the c-terminus of epidermin. several genes of unknown function are also found in the las gene cluster.a database has been assembled for all putative gene products of type a lantibiotic gene clusters. database searches, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction have been used to identify conserved sequence segments in the lanb, lanc, lane, lanf, lang, lank, lanm, lanp, lanr and lant gene products that may be essential for structure and function. this database allows for a rapid screening of newly determined sequences in lantibiotic gene clusters.
@background long-term tracking by decision making this paper presents a method for acquiring dense nonrigid shape and deformation from a single monocular depth sensor. we focus on modeling the human hand, and assume that a single rough template model is available. we combine and extend existing work on model-based tracking, subdivision surface fitting, and mesh deformation to acquire detailed hand models from as few as 15 frames of depth data. we propose an objective that measures the error of fit between each sampled data point and a continuous model surface defined by a rigged control mesh, and uses as-rigid-as-possible (arap) regularizers to cleanly separate the model and template geometries. a key contribution is our use of a smooth model based on subdivision surfaces that allows simultaneous optimization over both correspondences and model parameters. this avoids the use of iterated closest point (icp) algorithms which often lead to slow convergence. automatic initialization is obtained using a regression forest trained to infer approximate correspondences. experiments show that the resulting meshes model the user's hand shape more accurately than just adapting the shape parameters of the skeleton, and that the retargeted skeleton accurately models the user's articulations. we investigate the effect of various modeling choices, and show the benefits of using subdivision surfaces and arap regularization.
@background biomarker-based prediction of progression in mci: comparison of ad signature and hippocampal volume with spinal fluid amyloid-β and tau in 2010, we put forward a hypothetical model of the major biomarkers of alzheimer's disease (ad). the model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of ad biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of ad pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying ad biomarker changes, amyloid β (aβ) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic ad, in which we hypothesise that an incident aβ pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.
@background maternal union instability and childhood mortality risk in the global south, 2010–14 although children's family lives are diverse, the measurement of children's living arrangements has lagged, focusing on the relationships of children to parents while largely ignoring sibling composition. using data from the 2008 survey of income and program participation (n = 23,985) the authors documented patterns of family complexity among a nationally representative sample of children ages 0-17 living in a range of family structures. they also examined the independent and joint associations of family structure and family complexity on child economic well-being. family complexity was independently related to economic disadvantage, namely, a lower income-to-needs ratio and a higher likelihood of public assistance receipt. the role of family complexity was partially contingent on family structure, with the positive association between family complexity and receipt of public assistance more pronounced for children in families with 2 married biological parents. this study demonstrates the utility of integrating family structure and family complexity in studies of children's well-being.
@background bax‐mediated cell death by the gax homeoprotein requires mitogen activation but is independent of cell cycle activity the transduction of vascular myocytes with exogenous genetic material will be a common feature of many gene-based therapies for cardiovascular disorders. therefore, the successful application of cardiovascular gene therapy will require a thorough understanding of the molecular biology of the smooth muscle cell. of key importance are the transcriptional regulatory events that coordinate the de-differentiation and proliferation of myocytes in response to vascular injury. the goal of this review is to highlight what is known about the regulators of vascular myocyte transcription that may serve as candidate genes for the development of genetic strategies to manage postinterventional restenosis.
@method regulation of ventral surface co2/h+‐sensitive neurons by purinergic signalling a long-standing theory posits that central chemoreception, the cns mechanism for co2 detection and regulation of breathing, involves neurons located at the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata (vms). using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we identify vms neurons within the rat retrotrapezoid nucleus (rtn) that have characteristics befitting these elusive chemoreceptors. these glutamatergic neurons are vigorously activated by co2 in vivo, whereas serotonergic neurons are not. their co2 sensitivity is unaffected by pharmacological blockade of the respiratory pattern generator and persists without carotid body input. rtn co2-sensitive neurons have extensive dendrites along the vms and they innervate key pontomedullary respiratory centers. in brainstem slices, a subset of rtn neurons with markedly similar morphology is robustly activated by acidification and co2. their ph sensitivity is intrinsic and involves a background k+ current. in short, the co2-sensitive neurons of the rtn are good candidates for the long sought-after vms chemoreceptors.
@method heavy chain ferritin acts as an anti‐apoptotic gene that protects livers from ischemia‐reperfusion injury heme oxygenase 1 (ho-1) inhibits apoptosis by regulating cellular prooxidant iron. we now show that there is an additional mechanism by which ho-1 inhibits apoptosis, namely by generating the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (co). overexpression of ho-1, or induction of ho-1 expression by heme, protects endothelial cells (ecs) from apoptosis. when ho-1 enzymatic activity is blocked by tin protoporphyrin (snppix) or the action of co is inhibited by hemoglobin (hb), ho-1 no longer prevents ec apoptosis while these reagents do not affect the antiapoptotic action of bcl-2. exposure of ecs to exogenous co, under inhibition of ho-1 activity by snppix, substitutes ho-1 in preventing ec apoptosis. the mechanism of action of ho-1/co is dependent on the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling transduction pathway. expression of ho-1 or exposure of ecs to exogenous co enhanced p38 mapk activation by tnf-α. specific inhibition of p38 mapk activation by the pyridinyl imidazol sb203580 or through overexpression of a p38 mapk dominant negative mutant abrogated the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1. taken together, these data demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1 in ecs is mediated by co and more specifically via the activation of p38 mapk by co.
@background the utility of impulsive bias and altered decision making as predictors of drug efficacy and target selection: rethinking behavioral screening for antidepressant drugs rationalen-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) antagonists such as ketamine induce cognitive symptoms in man similar to those of schizophrenia and therefore might be useful as models of the disease in animals. however, it is unclear which nmdar antagonist(s) offer the best means to produce cognitive deficits in attention and working memory and to what extent those deficits can be measured selectively in rats.objectivesthe present study systematically compared the effects of eight different nmdar antagonists—mk-801, phencyclidine, (s)-(+)-ketamine, memantine, sdz-220,581, ro 25-6981, cp 101-606 and nvp-aam077—in rats using standard tests of visual attention, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5csrt), and working memory, the delayed matching to position task (dmtp).resultsdrug-induced responses varied qualitatively and quantitatively in both a compound- and a task-dependent manner. effects were generally confounded by concomitant motor and motivational disruption, although individual doses of phencyclidine for example appeared to impair selectively cognitive functions. interestingly, glun2b selective antagonists were unique in their effects; inducing potential performance benefit in the 5csrt.conclusionsoverall, the opportunity to induce a selective cognitive deficit in attention (5csrt) or working memory (dmtp) in the rat is limited by both the nmdar antagonist and the dose range used. the importance of a preclinical focus on ketamine, which is used more frequently in clinical settings, is limited by the extent to which cognitive effects can be both detected and quantified using this exposure regimen within these two operant assays.
@method accuracy of magnetic resonance in deeply infiltrating endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis backgroundthere is a lack of consensus regarding the use of quality scores in diagnostic systematic reviews. the objective of this study was to use different methods of weighting items included in a quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (quadas) to produce an overall quality score, and to examine the effects of incorporating these into a systematic review.methodswe developed five schemes for weighting quadas to produce quality scores. we used three methods to investigate the effects of quality scores on test performance. we used a set of 28 studies that assessed the accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux in children.resultsthe different methods of weighting individual items from the same quality assessment tool produced different quality scores. the different scoring schemes ranked different studies in different orders; this was especially evident for the intermediate quality studies. comparing the results of studies stratified as "high" and "low" quality based on quality scores resulted in different conclusions regarding the effects of quality on estimates of diagnostic accuracy depending on the method used to produce the quality score. a similar effect was observed when quality scores were included in meta-regression analysis as continuous variables, although the differences were less apparent.conclusionquality scores should not be incorporated into diagnostic systematic reviews. incorporation of the results of the quality assessment into the systematic review should involve investigation of the association of individual quality items with estimates of diagnostic accuracy, rather than using a combined quality score.
@background snp variants in ret and pax2 and their possible contribution to the primary hyperoxaluria type 1 phenotype during kidney development, pax2 and pax8 are expressed very early in the mammalian nephric duct and both precede the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase, c-ret. however, in pax2-/- mutant mice, expression of c-ret is lost after embryonic day 10.5. as the ret/gdnf pathway is necessary for renal development and there is a temporal and spatial relationship of pax2 and c-ret expression in the developing genito-urinary system, we postulate that pax2 is necessary for c-ret expression in the developing kidney. in vitro, pax2 protein is capable of physically interacting with a c-ret promoter, and both pax2 and pax8 can activate the expression of a reporter gene driven by the c-ret promoter. compound heterozygous null mice (pax2+/-: ret+/-) display an increased incidence of unilateral and bilateral renal agenesis, and smaller kidneys with fewer nephrons. furthermore, the expression of gdnf is reduced 2-3-fold, whereas c-ret expression is reduced 9-47-fold in pax2 heterozygous embryonic kidneys as detected by real-time quantitative rt (qrt)-pcr. the data demonstrate that pax2 plays an integral role in the initiation and maintenance of the ret/gdnf pathway by not only activating the ligand of the pathway, but by also enhancing the expression of the pathway receptor ret. the effects of reduced pax2 gene dosage are thus amplified resulting in a haploinsufficient phenotype.
@background resistance to diet-induced obesity in mice with a single substituted chromosome. values of insulin-mediated glucose disposal vary continuously throughout a population of apparently healthy persons, and a difference of > or = 600% exists between the most insulin-sensitive and the most insulin-resistant persons. approximately 50% of this variability can be attributed to differences in adiposity (25%) and fitness (25%), with the remaining 50% likely of genetic origin. the more insulin-resistant a person, the more likely that he or she will develop some degree of glucose intolerance, high triacylglycerol and low hdl concentrations, essential hypertension, and procoagulant and proinflammatory states, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). to identify persons at greater cvd risk because of these abnormalities, the world health organization, the adult treatment panel iii, and the international diabetes federation created a new diagnostic category, the metabolic syndrome. although the components of the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome are similar, the specific values for those components that define an abnormality are somewhat different, and the manner in which the abnormalities are used to make a positive diagnosis varies dramatically from version to version. this review will summarize the similarities in and differences between the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome, point out that the clustering of components that make up all 3 definitions of the metabolic syndrome is not accidental and occurs only in insulin-resistant persons, develop the argument that diagnosing the metabolic syndrome in a person has neither pedagogical nor clinical utility, and suggest that the clinical emphasis should be on treating effectively any cvd risk factor that is present.
@method diabetes mellitus and incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies abstract objective: funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. we examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. design: medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the cochrane database of systematic reviews. main outcome measure: degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. results: in the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. in all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. in 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. conclusions: a simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. key messages systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the cochrane database of systematic reviews critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure
@background effects of dose, flow rate, and bile acid on diclofenac disposition in the perfused rat liver the "hepatic arterial buffer response" hypothesis states that the hepatic artery is not controlled by liver parenchymal cell metabolic activity. bile salts stimulate liver metabolism (elevate bile formation) and dilate the hepatic artery. the present data show that the vascular and metabolic effects in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium are independent. low doses of taurocholate (1 microm . min-1 . kg-1) produce metabolic but not vascular responses. at higher doses both the hepatic artery and superior mesenteric artery dilate with equal sensitivity. taurocholate into the portal vein produced elevated bile flow and hepatic arterial dilation; infusion via the hepatic artery resulted in equal metabolic responses but much greater vascular effects. in addition, the time course of onset and termination of the metabolic and vascular responses supports the conclusion that the effects of taurocholic acid on hepatic bile flow and hepatic arterial flow are independent actions. this adds further support for the hepatic arterial buffer response being controlled by factors other than local hepatic metabolic demands.
@result enzymatic activity of glutathione s-transferase and dental fluorosis among children receiving two different levels of naturally fluoridated water we studied the effects of combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride on (i) brain biogenic amines, oxidative stress and its correlation with glutathione and linked enzymes; (ii) alterations in the structural integrity of dna; and (iii) brain and blood arsenic and fluoride levels. efficacy of alpha-tocopherol in reducing these changes was also determined. male mice were exposed to sodium meta arsenite (50 ppm) and sodium fluoride (50 ppm) individually and in combination for ten weeks. animals were given vitamin e supplementation (5 mg/kg, i.m., alternate days) throughout the experiment. exposure to arsenic and fluoride significantly decreased the levels of brain biogenic amines. however; acetyl cholinesterase (ache) and monoamine oxidase (mao) activities showed an increase on fluoride exposure. there was also an increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive species level, glutathione s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities and decreased superoxide dismutase activity, gsh:gssg ratio, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. combined exposure to these toxicants produced more pronounced effects on ache, mao, sod and catalase activities. infrared spectra showed less toxicity during combined exposure as the characteristic peaks of cytosine and alpha-helical structure of dna were observed in normal and arsenic plus fluoride-exposed animals. vitamin e reduced brain fluoride level and tissue oxidative stress but had no effect on arsenic. combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride does not necessarily lead to more pronounced toxicity and interestingly exhibit some antagonistic effects. vitamin e supplementation may be of added value in reverting some of the toxic effects.
@background necessity of organized low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer: from epidemiologic comparisons between china and the western nations background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

@background creation of a cleft in an angiography catheter to facilitate catheterization of branches of the aorta arising at an acute angle. purposeto evaluate the incidence of each extrahepatic collateral pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and to assess technical success rates and complications of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (tace) through each collateral.methodswe retrospective evaluated extrahepatic collateral pathways to hcc on angiography in 386 procedures on 181 consecutive patients. one hundred and seventy patients had previously undergone tace. tace through extrahepatic collaterals using iodized oil and gelatin sponge particles was performed when a catheter was advanced into the tumor-feeding branch to avoid nontarget embolization.resultsa single collateral was revealed in 275 tace procedures, two were revealed in 74, and three or more were revealed in 34. incidences of collateral source to hcc were 83% from the right inferior phrenic artery (ipa), 24% from the cystic artery, 13% from the omental artery, 12% from the right renal capsular artery (rca) and left ipa, 8% from the right internal mammary artery (ima) and right intercostal artery (ica), and 7% from the right inferior adrenal artery (iaa). technical success rates of tace were 53% in the right ica, 70% in the cystic artery, 74% in the omental artery, 93% in the left ipa, 96% in the right ipa, and 100% in the right rca, right ima, and right iaa. complications included skin necrosis after tace through the right ima (n = 1), cholecystitis after tace through the cystic artery (n = 1), and ulcer formation after tace through the right gastric artery (n = 1), in addition to pleural effusion and basal atelectasis after tace through the ipa and ima.conclusionour study suggests that tace through extrahepatic collaterals is possible with high success rates, and is also relatively safe.
@method conventional radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging for the analysis of trochlear dysplasia: the influence of selected levels on magnetic resonance imaging purpose to establish quantitative and qualitative magnetic resonance (mr) criteria for the diagnosis of trochlear dysplasia.   materials and methods mr images were analyzed in 16 consecutive patients with and 23 without trochlear dysplasia. the standard of reference was a true lateral radiograph of the knee. quantitative and qualitative mr criteria were assessed.   results in patients with trochlear dysplasia, the trochlear groove was significantly less deep than that in control subjects. the most accurate measurement was 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space (p: <.001), where a trochlear depth of 3 mm or less had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. the ventral trochlear prominence between the supratrochlear femoral cortex and the most ventral point of the trochlear floor (midsagittal section) was always larger than 6.9 mm in dysplastic trochleae. a facet ratio of less than 2:5 (medial to lateral) 3 cm above joint space level had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. a nipplelike anterior prominence at the superior end of the femoral trochlea on midsagittal images was a specific (91%) qualitative criterion.   conclusion dysplasia of the femoral trochlea can be diagnosed reliably by using quantitative or qualitative criteria on midsagittal or transverse mr images obtained 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space.
@background unsupervised video summarization with adversarial lstm networks we present a novel method for summarizing raw, casually captured videos. the objective is to create a short summary that still conveys the story. it should thus be both, interesting and representative for the input video. previous methods often used simplified assumptions and only optimized for one of these goals. alternatively, they used handdefined objectives that were optimized sequentially by making consecutive hard decisions. this limits their use to a particular setting. instead, we introduce a new method that (i) uses a supervised approach in order to learn the importance of global characteristics of a summary and (ii) jointly optimizes for multiple objectives and thus creates summaries that posses multiple properties of a good summary. experiments on two challenging and very diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where we outperform or match current state-of-the-art.
@method adaptation and evaluation of the neighborhood environment walkability scale in india (news-india) backgroundthe ipen (international physical activity and environment network) adult project seeks to conduct pooled analyses of associations of perceived neighborhood environment, as measured by the neighborhood environment walkability scale (news) and its abbreviated version (news-a), with physical activity using data from 12 countries. as ipen countries used adapted versions of the news/news-a, this paper aimed to develop scoring protocols that maximize cross-country comparability in responses. this information is also highly relevant to non-ipen studies employing the news/news-a, which is one of the most popular measures of perceived environment globally.methodsthe following countries participated in the ipen adult study: australia, belgium, brazil, colombia, czech republic, denmark, hong kong, mexico, new zealand, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states. participants (n = 14,305) were recruited from neighborhoods varying in walkability and socio-economic status. countries collected data on the perceived environment using a self- or interviewer-administered version of the news/news-a. confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to derive comparable country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a. the level of correspondence between standard and alternative versions of the news/news-a factor-analyzable subscales was determined by estimating the correlations and mean standardized difference (cohen’s d) between them using data from countries that had included items from both standard and alternative versions of the subscales.resultsfinal country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a provided acceptable levels of fit to the data and shared the same factorial structure with six latent factors and two single items. the correspondence between the standard and alternative versions of subscales of land use mix – access, infrastructure and safety for walking/cycling, and aesthetics was high. the brazilian version of the traffic safety subscale was highly, while the australian and belgian versions were marginally, comparable to the standard version. single-item versions of the street connectivity subscale used in australia and belgium showed marginally acceptable correspondence to the standard version.conclusionswe have proposed country-specific modifications to the original scoring protocol of the news/news-a that enhance inter-country comparability. these modifications have yielded sufficiently equivalent measurement models of the news/news-a. some inter-country discrepancies remain. these need to be considered when interpreting findings from different countries.
@background correlation of midbrain diameter and gait disturbance in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus we present nine cases of obstructive hydrocephalus (oh) associated with marked parkinsonism. four patients had noncommunicating oh (ncoh) [three nontumoral aqueductal stenosis (as), one tumoral as]. the presentation was that of acute or subacute parkinsonism, usually at the time of acute recurrent ventricular obstruction. three had a marked response to levodopa and required short‐term treatment after shunting. however, one has remained levodopa dependent after 21/2 years. three of the five patients with communicating oh (coh) presented with shunt‐responsive normal pressure hydrocephalus (nph), only later to develop progressive parkinsonism. one of these was found to have progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) at autopsy and psp was clinically susepected in one other patient. a third had an atypical course suggestive of psp; however, autopsy demonstrated the combination of lewy body parkinsonism and the sequelae of hydrocephalus. the remaining two coh patients presented with levodopa‐responsive parkinsonism. subsequent clinical features and imaging studies suggested the presence of nph. the pathophysiology of hydrocephalic parkinsonism probably involves variable sites of dysfunction in the nigrostriatal pathway and/or the cortico‐striato‐pallido‐thalamo‐cortical circuit. at certain locations these pathways lie in close proximity to the ventricular system and may be subjected to mass effects and ischemic changes secondary to ventriculomegaly. the additional importance of possible associations between subcortical cerebral ischemia, nph, and “degenerative” disorders such as psp and parkinson's disease is discussed.
@result favorable outcome of primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma patients treated with sequential rchop-rice regimen without radiotherapy between 1981 and 1986, 126 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with macop-b (methotrexate/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomy cin). all had advanced-stage lymphoma (ann arbor stage iii or iv or stage i or ii if the tumor mass was greater than 10 cm or b symptoms were present). the complete response (cr) rate was 84% and the toxic death rate was 6%. actuarial overall survival at 3 years was 67% and at 8 years 62%; the failure-free survival at 8 years was 52%. the follow-up for macop-b is 39 to 106 months (median 76) for living patients. a multivariate prognostic factor analysis for this group of patients identified age greater than 60 years. b symptoms, more than one extranodal site of disease, and more than three nodal sites of disease as the four significant prognostic variables. from june 1986, 108 patients were enrolled on a modification of macop-b called vacop-b (etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomycin ). their cr rate was 81%, and the toxic death rate was lower, at 3%. the 60% overall survival at 3 years is not statistically significantly different from that of macop-b. the incidence of moderate or severe mucositis and cushingoid changes was much lower with vacop-b. the mopp/abv (mechlorethamine/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone- doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine) hybrid chemotherapy regimen for advanced-stage hodgkin's disease was standard therapy from april 1981 to june 1988 for untreated patients aged 16 to 65. advanced stage was defined as stages iib, iiib, iii2a, iva, ivb, or stages iia or iiia with greater than four splenic nodules or a mediastinal mass greater than one third of the transthoracic diameter.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
@method emerging microfluidic tools for functional cellular immunophenotyping: a new potential paradigm for immune status characterization an accurate measurement of the immune status in patients with immune system disorders is critical in evaluating the stage of diseases and tailoring drug treatments. the functional cellular immunity test is a promising method to establish the diagnosis of immune dysfunctions. the conventional functional cellular immunity test involves measurements of the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated ex vivo. however, this "bulk" assay measures the overall reactivity of a population of lymphocytes and monocytes, making it difficult to pinpoint the phenotype or real identity of the reactive immune cells involved. in this research, we develop a large surface micromachined poly-dimethylsiloxane (pdms) microfiltration membrane (pmm) with high porosity, which is integrated in a microfluidic microfiltration platform. using the pmm with functionalized microbeads conjugated with antibodies against specific cell surface proteins, we demonstrated rapid, efficient and high-throughput on-chip isolation, enrichment, and stimulation of subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens. furthermore, the pmm-integrated microfiltration platform, coupled with a no-wash homogeneous chemiluminescence assay ("alphalisa"), enables us to demonstrate rapid and sensitive on-chip immunophenotyping assays for subpopulations of immune cells isolated directly from minute quantities of blood samples.
@background prediction of nucleosome rotational positioning in yeast and human genomes based on sequence-dependent dna anisotropy abstract recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the dna sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. although the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal dna has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. based on our evaluations of dna deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning. there are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal dna varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (yr) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., yyrr versus ryry); (iii) we postulate that alternating at-rich and gc-rich motifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and dna in the minor groove. using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions mapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, the pgub plasmid, chicken β-globin and three 5s rdna genes). we predicted 15 of the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. the predicted position of the ‘601’ nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the computed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by no more than 1 bp—an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. our analysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be divided into two groups based on the positioning ‘rules’ they follow. the sequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable yr/yyrr motifs at the minor-groove bending sites shl ±3.5 and ±5.5, which is similar to the α-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. apparently, the positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between histones h2a/h2b and the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna. in the other group (that includes the ‘601’ clone) the same yr/yyrr motifs occur predominantly at the sites shl ±1.5. the interaction between the h3/h4 tetramer and the central part of the nucleosomal dna is likely to be responsible for the positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the dna trajectory in these nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either an x-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal dna). the results presented here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the underlying dna sequence patterns guiding their positions.
@background losartan treatment protects retinal ganglion cells and alters scleral remodeling in experimental glaucoma accumulation of specific deposits and extracellular molecules under the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) has been previously observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (amd) and may play a role in the pathogenesis of amd. even though age is the major determinant for developing amd, clinical studies have revealed hypertension (htn) as another systemic risk factor. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is considered the most important hormone associated with htn. to evaluate the relationship of ang ii to amd, we studied whether mouse rpe expresses functional ang ii receptor subtypes and whether htn-induced ang ii regulates expression of these receptors as well as critical ecm molecules (mmp-2 and type iv collagen) involved in ecm turnover in rpe. we used 9-month-old c57bl/6 male mice infused with ang ii alone or ang ii in combination with the at1 receptor antagonist candesartan or the at2 receptor antagonist pd123319 for 4 weeks to determine whether htn-associated ang ii was important for ecm regulation in rpe. we found that mouse rpe expressed both ang ii receptor subtypes at the mrna and protein levels. infusion with ang ii induced htn and elevated plasma and ocular ang ii levels. ang ii also regulated at1a and at1b receptor mrna expression, the intracellular concentration of calcium [ca(2+)](i), mmp-2 activity, and type iv collagen accumulation. concurrent administration of ang ii with the at1 receptor blocker prevented the increase in blood pressure and rise in ocular ang ii levels, as well as the calcium and mmp-2 responses. in contrast, the type iv collagen response to ang ii was prevented by blockade of at2 receptors, but not at1 receptors. plasma ang ii levels were not modified by the at1 or at2 receptor blockade. since the effects of ang ii on mmp-2 and type iv collagen require inhibition of both ang ii receptor subtypes, these receptors may play a role as a potential therapeutic targets to prevent ecm turnover dysregulation in the rpe basement membrane, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism to explain the link between htn and amd.
@background human pih1 associates with histone h4 to mediate the glucose-dependent enhancement of pre-rrna synthesis. the snf2h-containing chromatin-remodeling complex norc is responsible for silencing a fraction of mammalian rrna genes (rdna). norc silences transcription by establishing heterochromatic features-including dna methylation, hypoacetylation of histone h4, and methylation of h3k9-at the rdna promoter []. we have investigated the mechanism of norc-mediated rdna silencing and show that binding of the bromodomain of tip5, the large subunit of norc, to acetylated nucleosomes is a prerequisite for norc function. a point mutation within the bromodomain impairs the association of norc with chromatin, prevents heterochromatin formation, and abolishes transcriptional repression. moreover, the association of norc with chromatin requires acetylation of histone h4 at lysine 16 (ach4k16), and binding to ach4k16 is required for subsequent deacetylation of h4k5, h4k8, and h4k12, indicating that acetylation of h4k16 plays an active role in norc-mediated heterochromatin formation. the bromodomain cooperates with an adjacent phd finger to recruit hdac1, dnmt1, dnmt3, and snf2h to rdna. if specifically targeted to the rdna promoter, the phd finger/bromodomain is capable of establishing heterochromatic features and rdna silencing. thus, the phd finger/bromodomain represents an autonomous unit that binds to ach4k16 and coordinates the chain of events that establish the repressed state of rdna.
@background efficacy of pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder: a report by the wpa section on pharmacopsychiatry objective in a naturalistic follow-up of adult bipolar patients, the authors examined the contributions of demographic, phenomenological, and clinical variables, including antidepressant use, to prospectively observed mood episode frequency.   method for 1,742 bipolar i and ii patients in the systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (step-bd), episodes of mood disorders were evaluated for up to 1 year of treatment.   results at entry, 32% of the patients met the dsm-iv criteria for rapid cycling in the prestudy year. of the 1,742 patients, 551 (32%) did not complete 1 year of treatment. among the 1,191 patients remaining, those with prior rapid cycling (n=356) were more likely to have further recurrences, although not necessarily more than four episodes per year. at the end of 12 months, only 5% (n=58) of the patients could be classified as rapid cyclers; 34% (n=409) had no further mood episodes, 34% (n=402) experienced one episode, and 27% (n=322) had two or three episodes. patients who entered the study with earlier illness onset and greater severity were more likely to have one or more episodes in the prospective study year. antidepressant use during follow-up was associated with more frequent mood episodes.   conclusions while dsm-iv rapid cycling was prospectively observed in only a small percentage of patients, the majority of these patients had continued recurrences at lower but clinically significant rates. this suggests that cycling is on a continuum and that prevention of recurrences may require early intervention and restricted use of antidepressants.
@background neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis is regulated by the alan shepard (shep) gene in drosophila melanogaster abstract the basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) protein dimmed (dimm) supports the differentiation of secretory properties in numerous peptidergic cells of drosophila melanogaster. dimm is coexpressed with diverse amidated neuropeptides and with the amidating enzyme peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (phm) in approximately 300 cells of the late embryo. here we confirm that dimm has transcription factor activity in transfected hek 293 cells and that the phm gene is a direct target. the mammalian dimm orthologue mist1 also transactivated the phm gene. dimm activity was dependent on the basic region of the protein and on the sequences of three e-box sites within phm's first intron; the sites make different contributions to the total activity. these data suggest a model whereby the three e boxes interact cooperatively and independently to produce high phm transcriptional activation. this dimm-controlled phm regulatory region displayed similar properties in vivo. spatially, its expression mirrored that of the dimm protein, and its activity was largely dependent on dimm. further, in vivo expression was highly dependent on the sequences of the same three e boxes. this study supports the hypothesis that dimm is a master regulator of a peptidergic cell fate in drosophila and provides a detailed transcriptional mechanism of dimm action on a defined target gene.
@result salmonella on pig carcasses: positive pigs and cross contamination in the slaughterhouse swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter coli/jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. the presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in denmark, norway and sweden. the major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. haccp (hazard analysis critical control point) and gmp (good manufacturing practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. the pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. the major contamination source of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures are used. other organisms such as aeromonas spp., l. moncytogenes/listeria spp. and s. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of gmp rules. the following affiliation to cps or ccps made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (cp), (ii) killing (cp), (iii) scalding (cp), (iv) dehairing (cp), (v) singeing/flaming (cp), (vi) polishing (cp), (vii) circumanal incision and removal of the intestines (ccp), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (ccp), (ix) splitting (cp), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (ccp) and (xi) deboning of the head (ccp).
@background linear and branched perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) isomer patterns differ among several tissues and blood of polar bears. long-term temporal trends (1991-2008) and spatial differences of perfluoroalkylated substances (pfass) were investigated in harbor porpoise (phocoena phocoena) liver samples of juvenile females from the baltic and north sea. additionally, spatial differences between the populations in the baltic sea and atlantic ocean (i.e. iceland and norway) and the influence of the body mass, age and sex on the pfas concentrations were examined. perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) was the predominant compound with a concentration range of 160-2425 ng/g wet weight (ww), followed by perfluorooctane sulfonamide (pfosa, 1-237 ng/g ww) and perfluoroundecanoate (pfuna, 3-124 ng/g ww). in terms of temporal trends, perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (pfsas) and pfosa concentrations decreased over time, while, conversely, the c(9)-c(13) perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (pfca) concentrations increased. spatial distribution of the contaminant concentrations showed consistently higher concentrations in the baltic sea and lowest concentrations in the icelandic population of the atlantic ocean.
@method comparing the biological impact of glatiramer acetate with the biological impact of a generic feature selection techniques have become an apparent need in many bioinformatics applications. in addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques. in this article, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.
@background identification, cloning, and functional expression of three glutathione transferase genes from aspergillus fumigatus. the glutathione s-transferases (gst) represent a major group of detoxification enzymes. all eukaryotic species possess multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound gst isoenzymes, each of which displays distinct catalytic as well as noncatalytic binding properties: the cytosolic enzymes are encoded by at least five distantly related gene families (designated class alpha, mu, pi, sigma, and theta gst), whereas the membrane-bound enzymes, microsomal gst and leukotriene c4 synthetase, are encoded by single genes and both have arisen separately from the soluble gst. evidence suggests that the level of expression of gst is a crucial factor in determining the sensitivity of cells to a broad spectrum of toxic chemicals. in this article the biochemical functions of gst are described to show how individual isoenzymes contribute to resistance to carcinogens, antitumor drugs, environmental pollutants, and products of oxidative stress. a description of the mechanisms of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gst isoenzymes is provided to allow identification of factors that may modulate resistance to specific noxious chemicals. the most abundant mammalian gst are the class alpha, mu, and pi enzymes and their regulation has been studied in detail. the biological control of these families is complex as they exhibit sex-, age-, tissue-, species-, and tumor-specific patterns of expression. in addition, gst are regulated by a structurally diverse range of xenobiotics and, to date, at least 100 chemicals have been identified that induce gst; a significant number of these chemical inducers occur naturally and, as they are found as nonnutrient components in vegetables and citrus fruits, it is apparent that humans are likely to be exposed regularly to such compounds. many inducers, but not all, effect transcriptional activation of gst genes through either the antioxidant-responsive element (are), the xenobiotic-responsive element (xre), the gst p enhancer 1(gpe), or the glucocorticoid-responsive element (gre). barbiturates may transcriptionally activate gst through a barbie box element. the involvement of the ah-receptor, maf, nrl, jun, fos, and nf-kappa b in gst induction is discussed. many of the compounds that induce gst are themselves substrates for these enzymes, or are metabolized (by cytochrome p-450 monooxygenases) to compounds that can serve as gst substrates, suggesting that gst induction represents part of an adaptive response mechanism to chemical stress caused by electrophiles. it also appears probable that gst are regulated in vivo by reactive oxygen species (ros), because not only are some of the most potent inducers capable of generating free radicals by redox-cycling, but h2o2 has been shown to induce gst in plant and mammalian cells: induction of gst by ros would appear to represent an adaptive response as these enzymes detoxify some of the toxic carbonyl-, peroxide-, and epoxide-containing metabolites produced within the cell by oxidative stress. class alpha, mu, and pi gst isoenzymes are overexpressed in rat hepatic preneoplastic nodules and the increased levels of these enzymes are believed to contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype observed in these lesions. the majority of human tumors and human tumor cell lines express significant amounts of class pi gst. cell lines selected in vitro for resistance to anticancer drugs frequently overexpress class pi gst, although overexpression of class alpha and mu isoenzymes is also often observed. the mechanisms responsible for overexpression of gst include transcriptional activation, stabilization of either mrna or protein, and gene amplification. in humans, marked interindividual differences exist in the expression of class alpha, mu, and theta gst. the molecular basis for the variation in class alpha gst is not known.

@result the effect of evening primrose oil for the prevention of xerotic cheilitis in acne patients being treated with isotretinoin: a pilot study fats are prevalent in western diets; they have known deleterious effects on muscle insulin resistance and may contribute to bone loss. however, relationships between fatty acids and locomotor system dysfunctions in elderly population remain controversial. the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fatty acid quality on the age related evolution of the locomotor system and to understand which aging mechanisms are involved. in order to analyze age related complications, the samp8 mouse strain was chosen as a progeria model as compared to the samr1 control strain. then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard "growth" diet - (2) "sunflower" diet (high ω6/ω3 ratio) - (3) "borage" diet (high γ-linolenic acid) - (4) "fish" diet (high in long chain ω3). mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. at 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. we demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.
@background molecular and electrophysiological characterization of gabaergic interneurons expressing the transcription factor coup-tfii in the adult human temporal cortex while the cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (mge) migrate rather diffusely into the cortex, interneurons that migrate out from the caudal ganglionic eminence (cge) mainly move caudally into the caudal cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in the form of the caudal migratory stream (cms) (yozu et al., 2005). although transplantation experiments at embryonic day 13.5 had revealed that the migrating cells in these two populations are already intrinsically different in regard to their ability to respond to the cge environment (yozu et al., 2005), it is not known how the cge cells are specified and how their migratory behavior is determined. in this study we showed that, although cge and lateral ganglionic eminence (lge) express almost the same marker molecules, lge cells do not migrate caudally when transplanted into the cge, suggesting that lge cells are intrinsically different from cge cells. we therefore compared the transcriptomes of the cge, mge, and lge, and the results showed that coup-tfii was expressed preferentially in the cge as well as in the migrating interneurons in the cms. transplantation experiments revealed that coup-tfii is sufficient to change the direction of mge cell migration to caudal when transplanted into the cge environment, and knockdown of coup-tfii inhibited the caudal migration of the cge cells. these results suggest that coup-tfii is both required and sufficient for the cge-cell-specific migratory behavior in the caudal direction. thus, a locally expressed transcription factor determines the migratory direction of the cortical interneurons in a region-specific manner.
@background finding common protein interaction patterns across organisms y‐family dna polymerases can replicate past a variety of damaged bases in vitro but, with the exception of dna polymerase η (polη), which is defective in xeroderma pigmentosum variants, there is little information on the functions of these polymerases in vivo. here, we show that dna polymerase ι (polι), like polη, associates with the replication machinery and accumulates at stalled replication forks following dna‐damaging treatment. we show that polη and polι foci form with identical kinetics and spatial distributions, suggesting that localization of these two polymerases is tightly co‐ordinated within the nucleus. furthermore, localization of polι in replication foci is largely dependent on the presence of polη. using several different approaches, we demonstrate that polη and polι interact with each other physically and that the c‐terminal 224 amino acids of polι are sufficient for both the interaction with polη and accumulation in replication foci. our results provide strong evidence that polη targets polι to the replication machinery, where it may play a general role in maintaining genome integrity as well as participating in translesion dna synthesis.
@background excretion of urinary proteins as predictors of early posttransplantation complications and late renal allograft failure thirty episodes of histologically verified acute vascular rejection in kidney transplant recipients were studied. in 11 grafts the rejection was mainly vascular, whereas in 19 grafts a concomitant cellular rejection was seen. histological features prognostic for bad outcome were glomerular necrosis and thrombi in the arteries and arterioles. characteristic findings in transplant cytology, i.e., high number of monocytes and low number of lymphocytes and blast cells were noted prior to the onset of clinical signs of rejection, and this finding was also persisting throughout the rejection episode. the numbers of lymphocytes and blast cells were significantly lower in grafts with a pure vascular rejection than in grafts with a concomitant cellular rejection. vascular rejection was reversible in 15 cases. as rescue therapy plasmapheresis and added immunosuppression were often successful.
@result head group-independent interaction of phospholipids with bile salts. a fluorescence and epr study. using complementary physical-chemical methods including turbidimetry, quasielastic light scattering, gel filtration, and phase analysis, we examined the interactions between dilute concentrations of the common bile salt, taurochenodeoxycholate (tcdc), and uni- and multilamellar vesicles (mlvs) composed of defined molecular species of lecithin (l) and varying contents of cholesterol (ch). dissolution rates of mlvs with micellar tcdc, as assessed by turbidimetry, were more rapid with vesicles composed of sn-1 palmitoyl species, typical of biliary l, compared with those composed of the more hydrophobic sn-1 stearoyl species. incorporation of ch retarded mlv dissolution rates in proportion to the ch content, and only at high ch contents were dissolution rates appreciably influenced by the sn-2 fatty acid composition of l. when mlvs contained ch in amounts characteristic of intracellular membranes (ch/l approximately 0.1), the dissolution rates of the individual l species by tcdc accurately predicted the steady state l composition of human bile. tcdc interacted with small unilamellar l/ch vesicles (suvs) at concentrations well below, as well as appreciably above, its critical micellar concentration. in accordance with the tcdc-egg yolk l-h2o phase diagram, perimicellar concentrations of tcdc interacted with suvs to form aggregates that were approximately twice the size of the suvs. these were consistent with the formation of a dispersed hexagonal (rod-like) phase, which co-existed with aqueous bile salt (bs) monomers and either micellar or unilamellar suv phases. micellar tcdc completely solubilized suvs as mixed micelles, putatively via this transient hexagonal phase. with modest ch-supersaturation, dissolution was followed by the reemergence of a new vesicle population that coexisted metastably with mixed micelles. with high ch supersaturation, tcdc extracted l and ch molecules from suvs in different proportions to form ch-supersaturated mixed micelles and ch-enriched suvs, in accordance with the metastable phase diagram. these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that sn-1 palmitoyl l species are subselected for bile, in part, by physical-chemical interactions of intracellular bs concentrations with ch-poor membranes and that the subsequent evolution of ch-rich vesicles and ch-saturated mixed micelles occurs via a transitional hexagonal (rod) phase. these liquid-crystalline states are likely to be transient in ch-unsaturated biles, but may persist in ch-supersaturated human biles because of their high ch contents which retard or inhibit these phase transitions.
@background lissotriton vulgaris genetic dissimilarity predicts paternity in the smooth newt ( gene flow and drift shape the distribution of neutral genetic diversity in metapopulations, but their local rates are difficult to quantify. to identify gene flow between demes as distinct from individual migration, we present a modified bayesian method to genetically test for descendants between an immigrant and a resident in a nonmigratory life stage. applied to a metapopulation of pond‐breeding european newts (triturus cristatus, t. marmoratus) in western france, the evidence for gene flow was usually asymmetric and, for demes of known census size (n), translated into maximally seven reproducing immigrants. temporal sampling also enabled the joint estimation of the effective demic population size (ne) and the immigration rate m (including nonreproductive individuals). ne ranged between 4.1 and 19.3 individuals, ne/n ranged between 0.05 and 0.65 and always decreased with n; m was estimated as 0.19–0.63, and was possibly biased upwards. we discuss how genotypic data can reveal fine‐scale demographic processes with important microevolutionary implications.
@background localization and location verification in non-homogeneous one-dimensional wireless ad-hoc networks security plays an important role in the ability to deploy and retrieve trustworthy data from a wireless sensor network. location verification is an effective defense against attacks which take advantage of a lack, or compromise, of location information. in this work, a secure probabilistic location verification method for randomly deployed dense sensor networks is proposed. the proposed probabilistic location verification (plv) algorithm leverages the probabilistic dependence of the number of hops a broadcast packet traverses to reach a destination and the euclidean distance between the source and the destination. a small number of verifier nodes are used to determine the plausibility of the claimed location, which is represented by a real number between zero and one. using the calculated plausibility metric, it is possible to create arbitrary number of trust levels in the location claimed. simulation studies verify that the proposed solution provides high performance in face of various types of attacks.
@background the evolution of multiple haemoglobins in fishes the oxygenation-linked, allosteric interactions of erythrocytic organic phosphates and urea with the haemoglobin (hb), and the functional significance of the hb multiplicity, were studies in an elasmobranch, squalus acanthias. the autochthonous red cell nucleoside triphosphates (ntp) atp and gtp (guanosine triphosphate) strongly depress o2 affinity of the stripped (cofactor-free) hb and increase cooperativity in o2 binding. as previously found in teleost hbs, gtp exerts a greater effect than atp at the same concentration. urea, in contrast, increases o2 affinity and depresses cooperativity. it also antagonizes the modulator effectivity of ntp at physiological ntp/hb concentration ratios. deoxygenation of the hb raises blood ph. this haldane effect contrasts with earlier findings for pacific specimens, but accords with the presence of a bohr effect (phi = delta log p50/delta ph). s. acanthias hb resolves into six main components (three pairs) on the basis of isoelectric point. there is no evidence for radical functional differentiation as found in teleosts with electrophoretically anodal and cathodal hb components. the physiological implications of the findings and the possible molecular mechanisms basic to the ntp and urea effects are discussed.
@background a new locally weighted k-means for cancer-aided microarray data analysis motivation it is far from trivial to select the most effective clustering method and its parameterization, for a particular set of gene expression data, because there are a very large number of possibilities. although many researchers still prefer to use hierarchical clustering in one form or another, this is often sub-optimal. cluster ensemble research solves this problem by automatically combining multiple data partitions from different clusterings to improve both the robustness and quality of the clustering result. however, many existing ensemble techniques use an association matrix to summarize sample-cluster co-occurrence statistics, and relations within an ensemble are encapsulated only at coarse level, while those existing among clusters are completely neglected. discovering these missing associations may greatly extend the capability of the ensemble methodology for microarray data clustering.   results the link-based cluster ensemble (lce) method, presented here, implements these ideas and demonstrates outstanding performance. experiment results on real gene expression and synthetic datasets indicate that lce: (i) usually outperforms the existing cluster ensemble algorithms in individual tests and, overall, is clearly class-leading; (ii) generates excellent, robust performance across different types of data, especially with the presence of noise and imbalanced data clusters; (iii) provides a high-level data matrix that is applicable to many numerical clustering techniques; and (iv) is computationally efficient for large datasets and gene clustering.   availability online supplementary and implementation are available at: http://users.aber.ac.uk/nii07/bioinformatics2010.   supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
@background insights into milk-clotting activity of latex peptidases from calotropis procera and cryptostegia grandiflora. latex proteins have drawn attention because they have shown several pharmacological activities. herein, the fibrin(ogen)olytic activity of cryptostegia grandiflora (cglp) and plumeria rubra (prlp) latices were evaluated and characterized. ion-exchange chromatography separated cglp in proteolytic (cglp pi) and nonproteolytic proteins (cglp pii). cglp and cglp pi hydrolyzed azocasein in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cglp pii and prlp showed negligible activities. cglp and cglp pi accelerated plasmatic clot formation and digested all fibrinogen chains in a time/dose-dependent manner, though in a nonspecific way. cglp and cglp pi did not fully hydrolyze the subunits of the fibrin clot since fibrin &agr;-chain showed resistance to proteolysis. no fibrinogenolytic activity was noticed after incubation of cglp and cglp pi with e-64. these results suggested that fibrinogenolytic and procoagulant activities of c. grandiflora were performed by cysteine proteases and confirm the activity of latex cysteine proteases as thrombin and plasmin-like proteins.
@background role of microstructure on fracture of dentin. a methodology to determine the constitutive parameters for the simulation of progressive delamination is proposed. the procedure accounts for the size of a cohesive finite element and the length of the cohesive zone to ensure the correct dissipation of energy. in addition, a closed-form expression for estimating the minimum penalty stiffness necessary for the constitutive equation of a cohesive finite element is presented. it is shown that the resulting constitutive law allows the use of coarser finite element meshes than is usually admissible, which renders the analysis of large-scale progressive delamination problems computationally tractable.
@background oncogenic akap9-braf fusion is a novel mechanism of mapk pathway activation in thyroid cancer. the ntrk1 gene in the q arm of chromosome i encodes one of the receptors for the nerve growth factor and is frequently activated as an oncogene in papillary thyroid carcinomas. the activation is due to chromosomal rearrangements juxtaposing the ntrk1 tyrosine kinase domain to 5′‐end sequences from different genes. the thyroid trk oncogenes are activated by recombination with at least three different genes: the gene coding for tropomyosin and tpr, both on chromosome i, and tfg on chromosome 3. in a previous study, we showed that two tumors carrying the tpr/ntrk1 rearrangement contained structurally different oncogenes named trk‐t1 and trk‐t2. in this paper, we report (1) the cdna structure of trk‐t2. (2) evidence that trk‐t2 is generated by different rearrangements in two thyroid tumors, and (3) a detailed analysis of the three different tpr/ntrk1 rearrangements. with molecular studies based on southern blot hybridization, cloning, and sequencing, we show that all the rearrangements are nearly balanced, involving deletion, insertion, or duplication of only few nucleotides. in one case, an additional rearrangement involving sequences derived from chromosome 17 was detected. genes chromosom. cancer 19:112–123, 1997. © 1997 wiley‐liss, inc.
@method differential impact of impaired fasting glucose versus impaired glucose tolerance on cardiometabolic risk factors in multi-ethnic overweight/obese children to evaluate how non-high-density-lipoprotein (non-hdl) is associated with impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and clustered metabolic risk (mr) factors among adolescents, we pooled 2764 adolescents, aged 12-19 years, from the national health and nutrition examination survey from 3 time periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) who were free of diabetes and had fasted overnight for this analysis. ifg was defined as 100 <or= glucose <or= 125 mg.dl-1. age- and sex-specific cut-offs were used for 4 mr factors: higher levels of triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure, and lower levels of hdl. clustered mr was defined as having any 2 of the 4 factors. overall, approximately 11% of adolescents had ifg. the mean level of non-hdl cholesterol was much higher in those with ifg than in those without ifg, with adjustment for certain confounding variables (121.4 vs. 110.1 mg.dl-1; p < 0.05). this difference could still be observed in adolescents with one or more clustered mr factors. however, there were no statistical differences in low-density-lipoprotein (ldl) level. compared with those who were without ifg and not at high levels of non-hdl - after adjustment for age, sex, race, current smoking, and body mass index - the odds of having clustered mr factors were 1.08 (95% ci, 0.65-1.82) for those with ifg and low non-hdl cholesterol, 3.55 (2.29-5.48) for those without ifg but with high non-hdl cholesterol, and 10.10 (3.67-27.80) for those with both ifg and high non-hdl cholesterol. moreover, those with ifg and at increased risk of obesity were more likely to have higher levels of non-hdl cholesterol (odds ratio (95% ci): 4.41 (2.28-8.50)), compared with those without ifg and not at increased risk of obesity. in summary, prediabetic adolescents with ifg and high levels of non-hdl cholesterol are more likely to have clustered mr factors. thus, the levels of non-hdl cholesterol may be an important indicator in monitoring cardiovascular disease risk among adolescents with ifg.
@background rapid and sustained response to tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, in a patient with nephrotic syndrome secondary to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related amyloidosis constitutively overproduced in proliferating synovial tissues, interleukin-6 (il-6) is deeply involved in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). tocilizumab is a humanized anti-human il-6 receptor antibody that binds to soluble and membrane-bound il-6 receptor, and at detectable levels in blood, tocilizumab is capable of almost completely blocking the transmembrane signaling of il-6. in clinical trials for patients with ra in japan, tocilizumab monotherapy has shown clinical efficacy equaling that of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitor in combination with methotrexate, and in an extension study in patients who responded to tocilizumab, almost no patients showed a decrease in the efficacy of tocilizumab. evidence obtained in a phase iii study in japan demonstrated that tocilizumab monotherapy had a sig-nificant inhibitory effect on the progression of structural joint damage compared with that of conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards). furthermore it has been shown that tocilizumab has an excellent ability to suppress serum amyloid a levels and could therefore be an important therapeutic strategy in amyloid a amyloidosis secondary to rheumatic diseases. the safety profile of tocilizumab appears to be satisfactory. however, several serious infections were also reported, and careful monitoring is therefore important during use.
@method segmentation schema for enhancing land cover identification: a case study using sentinel 2 data boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. for many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. we show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. for the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. we develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. we suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. this approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. it is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.
@background ultrastructural, ssrdna sequencing of myxobolus prochilodus and myxobolus porofilus and details of the interaction with the host prochilodus lineatus myxozoans are among the most abundant parasites in nature. their life cycles involve two hosts: an invertebrate, usually an annelid, and a vertebrate, usually a fish. they affect fish species in their natural habitats but also constitute a menace for fish aquaculture. using different strategies they are able to parasitize and cause damage in multiple organs, including mucosal tissues, which they use also as portals of entry. in fish, the main mucosal sites include the intestine, skin and gills. recently the finding of a specific mucosal immunoglobulin in teleost (igt), analogous to mammalian iga, and the capacity of fish to develop a specific mucosal immune response against different pathogens, has highlighted the importance of studying immune responses at mucosal sites. in this review, we describe the major biological characteristics of myxozoan parasites and present the data available regarding immune responses for species that infect mucosal sites. as models for mucosal immunity we review the responses to enteromyxum spp. and ceratomyxa shasta, both of which parasitize the intestine. the immune response at the skin and gills is also described, as these mucosal tissues are used by myxozoans as attaching surfaces and portal of entry, and some species also parasitize these sites. finally, the development of immunoprophylactic strategies is discussed.
@method arabinogalactan-protein epitope gal4 is differentially regulated and localized in cell lines of hybrid fir (abies alba × abies cephalonica) with different embryogenic and regeneration potential abstract. arabinogalactan-proteins (agps) are a family of extensively glycosylated hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are thought to have important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. after a brief introduction to agps highlighting the problems associated with defining and classifying this diverse family of glycoproteins, agp structure is described in terms of the protein component (including data from molecular cloning), carbohydrate component, processing of agps (including recent data on glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors) and overall molecular shape. next, the expression of agps is examined at several different levels, from the whole plant to the cellular levels, using a variety of experimental techniques and tools. finally, agp function is considered. although the existing functional evidence is not incontrovertible, it does clearly point to roles for agps in vegetative, reproductive, and cellular growth and development as well as programmed cell death and social control. in addition and most likely inextricably linked to their functions, agps are presumably involved in molecular interactions and cellular signaling at the cell surface. some likely scenarios are discussed in this context. agps also have functions of real or potential commercial value, most notably as emulsifiers in the food industry and as potential immunological regulators for human health. several important questions remain to be answered with respect to agps. clearly, elucidating the unequivocal functions of particular agps and relating these functions to their respective structures and modes of action remain as major challenges in the years ahead.
@method a putative alzheimer's disease risk allele in pck1 influences brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis whole-genome association studies (wgas) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. to address these issues, we developed plink, an open-source c/c++ wgas tool set. with plink, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. as well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, plink also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. we introduce plink and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. in particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. this information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.
@method a machine-learning approach reveals that alignment properties alone can accurately predict inference of lateral gene transfer from discordant phylogenies. the extent to which lateral genetic transfer has shaped microbial genomes has major implications for the emergence of community structures. we have performed a rigorous phylogenetic analysis of >220,000 proteins from genomes of 144 prokaryotes to determine the contribution of gene sharing to current prokaryotic diversity, and to identify "highways" of sharing between lineages. the inferred relationships suggest a pattern of inheritance that is largely vertical, but with notable exceptions among closely related taxa, and among distantly related organisms that live in similar environments.
@method extending depth of field by intrinsic mode image fusion this book addresses an area of perception engineering which deals with constructive processes. a model of the environment is analyzed using the information acquired from multiple viewpoints of multiple disparate sensors at multiple time instants. although the role of successive model building and active exploration of the environment, as is discussed in this book, is of great importance, only a few researchers of machine perception have thus far addressed the problem in these directions. krotkov's book, which is a modification and continuation of his highly successful dissertation, focuses on active exploratory sensing in the context of spatial layout perception. he uses stereo and focus to obtain distance by information, and to eventually develop cooperative combining techniques. means of a stereo system with verging cameras, it is demonstrated that the distance measurements can be significantly improved by combining two sources. in addition, the problem of merging information from the multiple views is discussed in detail. as the field of perception engineering seems to be of growing scientific and applied importance, both practitioners and researchers in machine perception will find this book a valuable addition to their libraries. rameshjain series editor acknowledgements i would like to thank professor ruzena bajcsy for her constant encouragement and guidance during the five years of research leading to the dissertation upon which this book is based. without her help in all matters, this work would never have been possible.
@background highly luminescent $a\hbox{-sio}_{\rm x} \langle \hbox{er} \rangle/\hbox{sio}_{2}/\hbox{si}$ multilayer structure we present a novel method for maximizing signal gain in continuously pumped silicon-waveguide raman amplifiers made with silicon-on-insulator technology. our method allows for pump-power depletion during raman amplification and makes use of a variational technique. its use leads to a system of four coupled nonlinear differential equations, whose numerical solution provides the optimal axial profile of the effective mode area along the waveguide length that maximizes the output signal power for a given amplifier length and a preset input (or output) cross-section area. in practice, the optimum profile can be realized by varying the cross-section area of a silicon waveguide along its length by tapering its width appropriately.
@method biliopancreatic diversion with transient gastroplasty and duodenal switch: long-term results of a multicentric study. the bpd/ds, if properly performed, has the best long-term weight loss of any bariatric operation. it is easy to reverse or revise, has the least marginal ulcers, cures the highest percentage of co-morbidities, has the least failures, and permits normal although smaller meals. it is our opinion that the bpd/ds should be considered as the gold standard bariatric operation.
@method global transcription profiling reveals multiple sugar signal transduction mechanisms in arabidopsis with the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. it is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. this approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. in doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. the q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.
@background urbanization, ethnicity and cardiovascular risk in a population in transition in nakuru, kenya: a population-based survey although demography continues to be the most prominent discipline concerned with population dynamics, involvement of other disciplines is highly desirable. the case for a multidisciplinary approach to population theory has been aptly stated by kurt mayer: “any meaningful interpretation of the cause and effects of population changes must … extend beyond formal statistical measurement of the components of change, i.e. fertility, mortality and migration, and draw on the theoretical framework of several other disciplines for assistance (mayer 1962).” in noting that the “analysis of the causal determinants and consequences of population change forms the subject matter of population theory,” mayer inferentially acknowledges the epidemiologic character of population phenomena, for as its etymology indicates, (epi, upon; demos, people; logos, study), epidemiology is the study of what “comes upon” groups of people. more specifically, epidemiology is concerned with the distribution of disease and death, and with their determinants and consequences in population groups. inasmuch as patterns of health and disease are integral components of population change, epidemiology's reservoir of knowledge about these patterns and their determinants in population groups serves not only as a basis for prediction of population change but also as a source of hypotheses that can be further tested to correct, refine and build population theory. furthermore, many epidemiologic techniques that have heretofore been limited to the examination of health and disease patterns can be profitably applied as well to the exploration of other mass phenomena, such as fertility control.    a theory of epidemiologic transition, sensitive to the formulations of population theorists who have stressed the demographic, biologic, sociologic, economic and psychologic ramifications of transitional processes, was conceived by this author less than four years ago. recognition of the limitations of demographic transition theory and of the need for comprehensive approaches to population dynamics stimulated the development of this theory (van nort and karon 1955; micklin 1968).
@method components of recommended asthma care and the use of long-term control medication among urban children with asthma purpose to examine daily use of antiinflammatory medication among children with asthma in east harlem, where hospitalization rates for asthma are among the highest in the united states.   methods we analyzed parent/guardian reports of medications used by children with current asthma (defined as physician diagnosis and wheezing during the previous 12 months) identified from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2 elementary schools.   results from an overall sample of 1319 children, 298 with current asthma were included in this analysis. most of those with asthma were puerto rican (136 [46%]) or black (98 [33%]), 168 (57%) were boys, and the median age was 8 years old. overall, 65 (22%) were using antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. a subgroup of 107 children with asthma had been hospitalized during the previous 12 months or had used beta(2)-agonist on a daily basis, suggesting persistent or severe asthma. of these 107 children, 42 (39%) were taking antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. multivariate analysis of these 107 children revealed that daily use of antiinflammatory medication was associated with using a spacer tube (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 3. 08; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.27,7.47) and having seen a physician in the past 6 months (aor: 3.46; ci: 1.01,11.9). compared with puerto ricans, blacks (aor:.32; ci:.12,.89) or children of other races/ethnicities (aor:.27; ci:.09,.85) were less likely to use antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis.   conclusion daily use of antiinflammatory medication for children with persistent or severe asthma in east harlem was underused. differences in access to care may explain some findings; however, reasons for ethnic differences in use remain unclear. both community interventions and additional provider education are needed.
@method integrative approach reveals composition of endoparasitoid wasp venoms the interpro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) integrates together predictive models or ‘signatures’ representing protein domains, families and functional sites from multiple, diverse source databases: gene3d, panther, pfam, pirsf, prints, prodom, prosite, smart, superfamily and tigrfams. integration is performed manually and approximately half of the total ∼58 000 signatures available in the source databases belong to an interpro entry. recently, we have started to also display the remaining un-integrated signatures via our web interface. other developments include the provision of non-signature data, such as structural data, in new xml files on our ftp site, as well as the inclusion of matchless uniprotkb proteins in the existing match xml files. the web interface has been extended and now links out to the adan predicted protein–protein interaction database and the spice and dasty viewers. the latest public release (v18.0) covers 79.8% of uniprotkb (v14.1) and consists of 16 549 entries. interpro data may be accessed either via the web address above, via web services, by downloading files by anonymous ftp or by using the interproscan search software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/interproscan/).
@method mr to ultrasound registration for image-guided prostate interventions a method is described for generating a patient-specific, statistical motion model (smm) of the prostate gland. finite element analysis (fea) is used to simulate the motion of the gland using an ultrasound-based 3d fe model over a range of plausible boundary conditions and soft-tissue properties. by applying principal component analysis to the displacements of the fe mesh node points inside the gland, the simulated deformations are then used as training data to construct the smm. the smm is used to both predict the displacement field over the whole gland and constrain a deformable surface registration algorithm, given only a small number of target points on the surface of the deformed gland. using 3d transrectal ultrasound images of the prostates of five patients, acquired before and after imposing a physical deformation, to evaluate the accuracy of predicted landmark displacements, the mean target registration error was found to be less than 1.9 mm.
@background laser therapy for onychomycosis: fact or fiction? it has always been difficult to treat onychomycosis due to decrease ability of topical agents to penetrate the nail and reach the affected nail bed. oral antifungal have shown good response but due to longer duration course it has potential to cause systemic side effects, leading to patient non‐adherence and adverse events. lasers, therefore, have been suggested for the treatment of onychomycosis due to their minimally invasive nature and the potential for requiring fewer treatment sessions. the aim of writing this article is to review a literature regarding treatment of onychomycosis by laser. this article will discuss about all the available laser treatment options for onychomycosis as well as their currently published, peer‐reviewed literature.
@method evolutionary toxicogenomics: diversification of the cyp12d1 and cyp12d3 genes in drosophila species the role that natural selection plays in governing the locations and early evolution of copy-number mutations remains largely unexplored. we used high-density full-genome tiling arrays to create a fine-scale genomic map of copy-number polymorphisms (cnps) in drosophila melanogaster. we inferred a total of 2658 independent cnps, 56% of which overlap genes. these include cnps that are likely to be under positive selection, most notably high-frequency duplications encompassing toxin-response genes. the locations and frequencies of cnps are strongly shaped by purifying selection, with deletions under stronger purifying selection than duplications. among duplications, those overlapping exons or introns, as well as those falling on the x chromosome, seem to be subject to stronger purifying selection.
@result effect of k-252a and abscisic acid on the efflux of citrate from soybean roots. in many plants, efflux of organic anions from roots has been proposed as one of the major al resistance mechanisms. however it remains unknown how plants regulate efflux of organic anions in response to al. in this study, the regulatory mechanisms of al-responsive malate efflux in wheat (triticum aestivum) were characterized focusing on the role of protein phosphorylation. al-resistant wheat (cv atlas) initiated malate efflux at 5 min after addition of al, and this response was sensitive to temperature. k-252a, a broad range inhibitor of protein kinases, effectively blocked the al-induced malate efflux accompanied with an increased accumulation of al and intensified al-induced root growth inhibition. a transient activation of a 48-kd protein kinase and an irreversible repression of a 42-kd protein kinase were observed preceding the initiation of malate efflux, and these changes were canceled by k-252a. malate efflux was accompanied with a rapid decrease in the contents of organic anions in the root apex, such as citrate, succinate, and malate but with no change in the contents of inorganic anions such as chloride, nitrate, and phosphate. these results suggest that protein phosphorylation is involved in the al-responsive malate efflux in the wheat root apex and that the organic anion-specific channel might be a terminal target that responds to al signaling mediated by phosphorylation.
@background osteoprotegerin and denosumab stimulate human beta cell proliferation through inhibition of the receptor activator of nf-κb ligand pathway. abstract the cyclic amp (camp) signaling pathway is central in β-cell gene expression and function. in the nucleus, protein kinase a (pka) phosphorylates creb, resulting in recruitment of the transcriptional coactivators p300 and creb binding protein (cbp). cbp, but not p300, is phosphorylated at serine 436 in response to insulin action. cbp phosphorylation disrupts creb-cbp interaction and thus reduces nuclear camp action. to elucidate the importance of the camp-pka-creb-cbp pathway in pancreatic β cells specifically at the nuclear level, we have examined mutant mice lacking the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site of cbp. in these mice, the creb-cbp interaction is enhanced in both the absence and presence of camp stimulation. we found that islet and β-cell masses were increased twofold, while pancreas weights were not different from the weights of wild-type littermates. β-cell proliferation was increased both in vivo and in vitro in isolated islet cultures. surprisingly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from perfused, isolated mutant islets was reduced. however, β-cell depolarization with kcl induced similar levels of insulin release from mutant and wild-type islets, indicating normal insulin synthesis and storage. in addition, transcripts of pgc1a, which disrupts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, were also markedly elevated. in conclusion, sustained activation of cbp-responsive genes results in increased β-cell proliferation. in these β cells, however, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was diminished, resulting from concomitant creb-cbp-mediated pgc1a gene activation.
@method reinduction platform for children with first marrow relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a children's oncology group study[corrected]. the relapse rate in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is approximately 30% but few reinduction regimens have investigated the intensive use of polyethylene glycol escherichia coli asparaginase (peg-asp). therefore, we assessed the pharmocokinetics and efficacy of peg-asp in this setting. children with b-precursor all, in first marrow and/or extramedullary relapse were eligible. reinduction included doxorubicin on day 1, prednisone for 28 days, vincristine weekly for 4 weeks, and peg-asp either weekly or biweekly by randomization. asparaginase levels and antibody to both e coli asparaginase and peg-asp were measured weekly just before each peg-asp dose. overall, 129 of 144 patients (pts) (90%) achieved a complete remission (cr). there was a highly significant difference in cr rates between weekly (69 of 71; 97%) and biweekly (60 of 73; 82%) peg-asp dosing (p =.003). grade 3 or 4 infectious toxicity was common (50%), but only 4 pts died of sepsis during induction. other toxicities were infrequent and hypersensitivity was rare (6 of 144; 4%). low asparaginase levels were associated with high antibody titers to either native (p =.024) or peg asp (p =.0013). the cr rate was significantly associated with higher levels of asparaginase (p =. 012). patients with all in first relapse receiving weekly peg-asp had a higher rate of second remission compared with biweekly dosing. low levels of asparaginase were associated with high antibody titers. increased asparaginase levels may correlate with an improved cr rate. the use of intensive peg-asp should be explored further in the treatment of all.

@background indoor human navigation systems: a survey in the research project navio (pedestrian navigation systems in combined indoor/outdoor environements) at our university we are working on the improvement of navigation services for pedestrians. thereby we are mainly focusing on the information aspect of location-based services, i.e., on the user’s task at hand and the support of the user’s decisions by information provided by such a service. specifications will allow us to select appropriate sensor data and to integrate data when and where needed, to propose context-dependent routes fitting to partly conflicting interests and goals as well as to select appropriate communication methods in terms of supporting the user guidance by various multimedia cartography forms. these taks are addressed in the project in three different work packages, i.e., the first on “integrated positioning”, the second on “pedestrian route modeling” and the third on “multimedia route communication”. in this paper we will concentrate on the research work and findings in the first work package. for continuous positioning of a pedestrian suitable location technologies include gnss and indoor location techniques, cellular phone positioning, dead reckoning sensors (e.g. magnetic compass, gyro and accelerometers) for measurement of heading and travelled distance as well as barometric pressure sensors for height determination. the integration of these sensors in a modern multi-sensor system can be performed using an adapted kalman filter. to test and to demonstrate our approach, we take a use case scenario into account, i.e., the guidance of visitors to departments of the vienna university of technology. the results of simulation studies and practical tests could confirm that such a service can achieve a high level of performance for the guidance of a pedestrian in urban areas and mixed indoor and outdoor environments.
@background in vitro and in vivo evaluation of novel cross-linked saccharide based polymers as bile acid sequestrants beta-cyclodextrin is a compound that forms inclusion complexes with a variety of molecules, specially bile acids and sterols. this study examines the effects of beta-cyclodextrin on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups that received during 7 weeks: control diet, 2% cholesterol diet (a), a+2.5% beta-cyclodextrin (b) and a+5% beta-cyclodextrin (c). the cholesterol-rich diet induced hepatomegaly and fatty liver and significantly reduced cholesterol, bile acid and phospholipid secretion. addition of beta-cyclodextrin normalised biliary lipid secretion. moreover, when compared to a, beta-cyclodextrin significantly lowered plasma phospholipid concentration (b: -21%; c: -29%) and the liver free/total cholesterol molar ratio (b: -40%; c: -38%), increased bile acid faecal output (b: +17%; c: +62%) and enhanced cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity (b:+50%; c : +100%)and mrna levels (b: + 14%; c: +29%). 5% beta-cyclodextrin also reduced plasma triglycerides concentration (-38%). however, alt and ast activities were significantly increased (b: +140% and +280%; c: +72% and +135%) and there was a high incidence of cell necrosis with portal inflammatory cell infiltration. addition of beta-cyclodextrin to a cholesterol-rich diet results in a triglyceride-lowering action, enhancement of bile acid synthesis and excretion, and normalization of biliary lipid secretion, but produces a marked hepatotoxic effect.
@method the submission is for the special topic on large scale learning hash kernels for structured data using extensions of linear algebra concepts to reproducing kernel hilbert spaces (rkhs), we define a unifying framework for random walk kernels on graphs. reduction to a sylvester equation allows us to compute many of these kernels in o(n3) worst-case time. this includes kernels whose previous worst-case time complexity was o(n6), such as the geometric kernels of gartner et al. [1] and the marginal graph kernels of kashima et al. [2]. our algebra in rkhs allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations. experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that our algorithms are often more than 1000 times faster than existing approaches.
@background estrogens and ici182,780 (faslodex) modulate mitosis and cell death in immature cerebellar neurons via rapid activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase cell death is generally classified into two large categories: apoptosis represents active, programmed cell death, while necrosis represents passive cell death without underlying regulatory mechanisms. recent progress revealed that caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. unexpectedly, however, caspase inhibition occasionally turns the morphology of programmed cell death from apoptotic into necrotic without inhibiting death itself. in this article, we review different models of caspase-independent programmed cell death showing necrotic-like morphology, including our ras-mediated caspase-independent cell death. based on these findings, we suggest the existence of a necrotic-like cell death regulated by cellular intrinsic death programs distinct from that of apoptosis. even though type 2 physiological cell death, or autophagic degeneration, has been recognized as a necrotic-like programmed cell death for a long time, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been identified despite its physiological significance. this has been in part due to the previous absence of adequate caspase-independent cellular models to study, recent efforts may now help to elucidate these mechanisms.
@background historical population demography of red snapper (lutjanus campechanus) from the northern gulf of mexico based on analysis of sequences of mitochondrial dna since the 1920s, population geneticists have had measures that describe how genetic variation is distributed spatially within a species’ geographical range. modern genetic survey techniques frequently yield information on the evolutionary relationships among the alleles or haplotypes as well as information on allele frequencies and their spatial distributions. this evolutionary information is often expressed in the form of an estimated haplotype or allele tree. traditional statistics of population structure, such as f statistics, do not make use of evolutionary genealogical information, so it is necessary to develop new statistical estimators and tests that explicitly incorporate information from the haplotype tree. one such technique is to use the haplotype tree to define a nested series of branches (clades), thereby allowing an evolutionary nested analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation. such a nested analysis can be performed regarding the geographical sampling locations either as categorical or continuous variables (i.e. some measure of spatial distance). it is shown that such nested phylogeographical analyses have more power to detect geographical associations than traditional, nonhistorical analyses and, as a consequence, allow a broader range of gene‐flow parameters to be estimated in a precise fashion. more importantly, such nested analyses can discriminate between phylogeographical associations due to recurrent but restricted gene flow vs. historical events operating at the population level (e.g. past fragmentation, colonization, or range expansion events). restricted gene flow and historical events can be intertwined, and the cladistic analyses can reconstruct their temporal juxtapositions, thereby yielding great insight into both the evolutionary history and population structure of the species. examples are given that illustrate these properties, concentrating on the detection of range expansion events.
@method impact of genetic polymorphisms of slc2a2, slc2a5, and khk on metabolic phenotypes in hypertensive individuals the oral or intravenous administration of fructose to children results in dramatic rises in both urate and lactate concentrations in serum and an increase in the excretion of uric acid in the urine, findings interpreted as being caused by rapid nucleic acid degradation due to the increased intracellular lactic acidosis in the liver (perheentupa and raivio, 1967). as lactate also reduces renal excretion of urate (yu, sirota, halpern, and gutman, 1967), these authors were unable to assess the relative importance of hepatic and renal factors in the resultant hyperuricaemia, but the increase in the urinary uric acid suggested either a sudden increase in urate production or a shift of urate from an intracellular pool to the extracellular fluid. moreover, fox and kelley (1972) were unable to demonstrate any consistent decrease in the fractional clearance of urate after fructose infusions. studies in cebus monkeys have also demonstrated hyperuricaemia and increases in urinary uric acid excretion after infusions of high concentrations of hexoses, fructose having the greatest effect and glucose a lesser effect (simkin, 1969). this has not been a uniform finding, however, and no significant changes in serum urate concentrations were demonstrated during the 3 hrs after the intravenous administration of 100 g. fructose to ten young adult males (curreri and pruitt, 1970). because of the conflicting evidence, the lack of information concerning the possible mechanism involved and the potential importance in patients with hyperuricaemia, it was decided to compare the effect of diets containing large quantities of either added fructose or glucose on urate metabolism, as reflected by the miscible urate pool and turnover rate and the simultaneous incorporation of glycine into both urinary and produced uric acid.
@method effects of repetitive shoulder activity on the subacromial space in manual wheelchair users abstract objective to investigate the reliability of ultrasonographic measurement of acromiohumeral distance (ahd) and the effects of shoulder positioning on ahd among manual wheelchair users (mwus) with spinal cord injury (sci) and an able-bodied control group. methods ten mwus with sci and 10 able-bodied subjects participated in this study. the ultrasonographic measurements of ahd from each subject were obtained by two raters during passive and active scapular plane arm elevation in neutral, 45°, 90° with and without resistance and in a weight relief raise position. the measurements were recorded again by each rater using the same procedures after a 30-minute time interval. all raters were blinded to each other's measurements. setting university laboratories and veteran affairs healthcare system. results intra-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient, icc > 0.83) and inter-rater (icc > 0.78) reliability was excellent for both the mwus with sci and able-bodied groups across all arm positions except for the 45° position in the control group for one of the raters (intra-rater: icc < 0.40 and inter-rater: icc < 0.60). ahd significantly reduced when the shoulder was in the 90° arm elevated positions with or without resistance. conclusion findings from our study demonstrated that ultrasonography is a reliable means to evaluate ahd in both able bodied and individuals with sci, who are known to have significant shoulder pathology. this technique could be used to develop reference measures and to identify changes in ahd caused by interventions.
@background endogenous swimming rhythms underlying the spawning migration of the blue crab, callinectes sapidus: ontogeny and variation with ambient tidal regime abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
@background efficient and secure network services in wireless sensor networks making effective use of the vast amounts of data gathered by large-scale sensor networks will require scalable, self-organizing, and energy-efficient data dissemination algorithms. previous work has identified data-centric routing as one such method. in an asso-ciated position paper [23], we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (dcs), is also a useful approach. under dcs, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. in this paper, we describe ght, a geographic hash table system for dcs on sensornets. ght hashes keys into geographic coordi-nates, and stores a key-value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. the system replicates stored data lo-cally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. it uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key-value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. and it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. we evaluate the performance of ght as a dcs system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. our results demonstrate that ght is the preferable approach for the application workloads predicted in [23], offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.
@background neuroenhancement by noninvasive brain stimulation is not a net zero-sum proposition here we review the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) in modulating cortical networks in ways that might produce performance enhancements in healthy human subjects. to date over sixty studies have reported significant improvements in speed and accuracy in a variety of tasks involving perceptual, motor, and executive processing. two basic categories of enhancement mechanisms are suggested by this literature: direct modulation of a cortical region or network that leads to more efficient processing, and addition-by-subtraction, which is disruption of processing which competes or distracts from task performance. potential applications of tms cognitive enhancement, including research into cortical function, rehabilitation therapy in neurological and psychiatric illness, and accelerated skill acquisition in healthy individuals are discussed, as are methods of optimizing the magnitude and duration of tms-induced performance enhancement, such as improvement of targeting through further integration of brain imaging with tms. one technique, combining multiple sessions of tms with concurrent tms/task performance to induce hebbian-like learning, appears to be promising for prolonging enhancement effects. while further refinements in the application of tms to cognitive enhancement can still be made, and questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, this appears to be a fruitful area of investigation that may shed light on the basic mechanisms of cognitive function and their therapeutic modulation.
@background does extended lymph node dissection affect the lymph node density and survival after radical cystectomy? purpose to our knowledge the extent of lymphadenectomy with cystectomy, the number of lymph nodes to be retrieved and the anatomical groups to be dissected are still undetermined. this study was done to clarify these issues.   materials and methods a total of 200 patients underwent radical cystectomy and extended lymphadenectomy up to the level of origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. removed tissues were labeled according to anatomical location and sent separately for pathological evaluation. in each group the number and status of lymph nodes were determined. the number of positive nodes was correlated with the number of retrieved nodes. cases with a single positive node were identified and the anatomical location was defined.   results the mean number of retrieved nodes per patient +/- se was 50.6 +/- 14.4 and 48 (24%) patients had nodal disease. the mean number of positive nodes per involved case was 8.08 +/- 13.2. there was a weak correlation between the number of positive nodes and the number of harvested nodes. bilateral disease was noted in 39.6% of cases. single node involvement was observed in 22 cases, of which all except 1 were in the endopelvic region.   conclusions there is a sentinel region, which is the endopelvic region (that is the internal iliac and obturator groups of lymph nodes). there are no skipped lesions. negative nodes in the endopelvic region indicate that more proximal dissection is not necessary. bilateral endopelvic dissection is mandatory.

@method intraindividual variability in domain-specific cognition and risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia context some studies of hormone treatment in postmenopausal women suggest benefits on specific cognitive functions, particularly memory.   objective the objective of this study was to determine whether hormone therapy influences changes in specific cognitive functions and affect in older women.   design this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.   setting participants were women from 14 of 40 clinical centers of the women's health initiative (whi).   participants postmenopausal women (1416) aged 65 yr and older, free of probable dementia, and enrolled in whi and the whi memory study (whims) trial of combination estrogen and progestin for a mean of 3 yr and followed for a mean of 1.35 yr, were studied.   intervention intervention was conjugated equine estrogen (cee; 0.625 mg) with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (mpa) in one daily tablet (cee + mpa) or placebo.   main outcome measures annual rates of change in specific cognitive functions and affect, adjusted for time since randomization, were measured.   results cee + mpa had a negative impact on verbal memory (p <or= 0.01) and a trend to a positive impact on figural memory (p = 0.012) over time compared with placebo, but other cognitive domains were not affected. both effects on memory were evident only after long-term therapy. cee + mpa did not significantly influence positive affect, negative affect, or depressive symptoms.   conclusions the effect of cee + mpa on cognitive function varies across cognitive domains in older women, reflecting both possible beneficial and detrimental actions of ovarian steroids on the aging brain. our results extend prior findings about dementia and global cognitive function to age-related changes in specific cognitive functions and suggest directions for future research.
@result the two-component adjuvant ic31® boosts type i interferon production of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells via ligation of endosomal tlrs plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) are unique with respect to their capacity to produce unsurpassed amounts of ifn-α and coexpress tlr7 and tlr9, mediating ifn-α production. although tlrs are critical receptors of innate immunity, little is known about the immunological effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation. we have analyzed the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation on ifn-α production by leukocytes and pdcs. our experiments revealed that both synthetic (resiquimod and loxoribine) and natural (ssrna40) tlr7 ligands abrogate cpg-a- and cpg-c-oligodeoxynucleotide (odn)-induced ifn-α production by human leukocytes. because tlr7 ligands themselves represent important ifn-α inducers, we demonstrated that substimulatory tlr7 ligand concentrations significantly inhibited cpg-a-induced ifn-α. delayed addition of tlr7 ligands still resulted in complete suppression of cpg-a-odn-induced ifn-α production, suggesting that the inhibition is unlikely to be caused by a kinetic uptake advantage. unlike for cpg-a and cpg-c, tlr7 ligands did not inhibit cpg-b-odn-induced ifn-α production. experiments with purified human pdcs demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation were mediated directly by pdcs. suppression of ifn-α production was not related to increased cell death and was also detectable in enriched mouse pdcs. analyses of pdcs suggested that the tlr7 signal regulates the outcome of tlr7 ligand/cpg-a-odn costimulation and can either inhibit (ifn-α) or promote (il-8/cd40) cytokine and surface marker expression. our data reveal for the first time a strong inhibitory effect of tlr7 stimulation on ifn-α production induced by cpg-a- and cpg-c-odns. these findings provide novel insight into the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation and may support the development of novel tlr9 inhibitors.
@background human bcas3 expression in embryonic stem cells and vascular precursors suggests a role in human embryogenesis and tumor angiogenesis desmoplastic medulloblastoma (dmb) is a malignant cerebellar tumour composed of two distinct tissue components, pale islands and desmoplastic areas. previous studies revealed mutations in genes encoding members of the sonic hedgehog pathway, including ptch, smoh and sufuh in dmbs. however, little is known about other genomic aberrations. we performed comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) analysis of 22 sporadic dmbs and identified chromosomal imbalances in 20 tumours (91%; mean, 4.9 imbalances/tumour). recurrent chromosomal gains were found on chromosomes 3, 9 (six tumours each), 20, 22 (five tumours each), 2, 6, 7, 17 (four tumours each) and 1 (three tumours). recurrent losses involved chromosomes x (eight tumours), y (six of eleven tumours from male patients), 9, 12 (four tumours each), as well as 10, 13 and 17 (three tumours each). four tumours demonstrated high‐level amplifications involving sequences from 1p22, 5p15, 9p, 12p13, 13q33‐q34 and 17q22‐q24, respectively. further analysis of the 9p and 17q22‐q24 amplicons by array‐based cgh (matrix‐cgh) and candidate gene analyses revealed amplification of jmjd2c at 9p24 in one dmb and amplification of rps6kb1, appbp2, ppm1d and bcas3 from 17q23 in three dmbs. among the 17q23 genes, rps6kb1 showed markedly elevated transcript levels as compared to normal cerebellum in five of six dmbs and four of five classic medulloblastomas investigated. finally, cgh analysis of microdissected pale islands and desmoplastic areas showed common chromosomal imbalances in five of six informative tumours. in summary, we have identified several novel genetic alterations in dmbs and provide genetic evidence for a monoclonal origin of their different tissue components. copyright © 2006 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
@method an integrative model of motor unit activity during sustained submaximal contractions. aim to test the hypothesis that time-wise increase in intramuscular pressure (imp) and subsequent decrease in muscle tissue oxygenation (to(2)) results in muscle fatigue development during a non-exhaustive, low-force contraction evidenced by changes in electromyogram (emg) and particular mechanomyogram (mmg).   methods seven subjects performed static elbow flexion at 10% maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) for 10 min (10% mvc(10 min)). surface emg, mmg, imp and to(2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy was recorded from m. biceps brachii during 10% mvc(10 min) and during 5% mvc test contractions of 1 min duration performed before 10% mvc(10 min), 10 and 30 min post-exercise. emg and mmg were analysed for root mean square (rms) and mean power frequency (mpf).   results during 10% mvc(10 min) mmgrms increased from initial level of 0.04 +/- 0.01 to 0.11 +/- 0.07 m s(-2) in the last minute and mmgmpf and emgmpf decreased from 34.9 +/- 8.2 to 21.3 +/- 3.8 hz and from 71.7 +/- 10.9 to 61.7 +/- 10.0 hz respectively. similar changes were present in 5% mvc test contractions 30 min post-exercise. initially, to(2) decreased by 6.9 +/- 6.5% of resting level but returned to rest within 1 min. imp remained constant during the contraction after an initial fourfold increase from resting level of 12.2 +/- 10.4 mmhg.   conclusions imp was anticipated to increase with time of contraction due to e.g. increased muscle water content; but this was not confirmed. consequently, muscle blood flow was unlikely to be impeded with contraction time, which may account for the maintenance of to(2). thus, decreased to(2) did not underlie either acute or long-term muscle fatigue development evidenced by changes in emg and particular mmg variables.
@background evaluation of pulmonary embolism in a pediatric population with high clinical suspicion summary.  venous thromboembolic (vte) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. systemic vte are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. the epidemiology of systemic vte has been studied in international registries. in children older than 3 months, teenagers are the largest group developing vte. the most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system vte are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. however, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system vte and pulmonary embolism (pe) have not been established. treatment studies for vte consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. the long‐term outcome of systemic vte, post‐thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (csvt) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. the etiology of csvt includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood csvt have recently become available through the canadian pediatric ischaemic stroke registry. clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. there have only been case‐series studies carried out in the treatment of csvt. properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic vte/pe and csvt to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long‐term management.
@background fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis of primary ocular adnexal malt lymphoma we performed a prospective multiparametric correlative clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic analysis of 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations developing in 108 patients between october 1977 and july 1987. the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were distributed among the 108 patients as follows: orbit 69 (64%), conjunctiva 30 (28%), and eyelids nine (8%). the 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were classified as follows: polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia, 32 (22 orbit, nine conjunctiva, one eyelid) (27%); monoclonal b cell lymphoma, 81 (48 orbit, 25 conjunctiva, eight eyelid) (69%); null cell lymphoma, one (orbit) (1%); and histologically indeterminate, three (one each: orbit, conjunctiva, eyelid) (3%). patients presenting with ocular adnexal polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia and monoclonal b cell lymphoma, and patients developing unilateral and bilateral ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, presenting complaints, duration of symptoms, or ophthalmic findings. classifying ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations into benign and malignant categories by histopathologic criteria and into polyclonal and monoclonal b cell categories by immunophenotypic criteria was not useful in predicting eventual outcome, including the occurrence of extraocular lymphoma. however, the clinicopathologic characteristics did differ according to the anatomic site of involvement and histopathology of the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations. lymphoid infiltrates of the conjunctiva were associated with a lower incidence of extra-ocular lymphoma (20%) than were those of the orbit and eyelid, 35% and 67%, respectively (statistically significant, p less than .03). ocular adnexal small lymphocytic and intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas were less often associated with extra-ocular lymphoma than were ocular adnexal lymphomas of all other histologic types, 27% and 46%, respectively (p less than .09). however, the single most important and statistically significant prognostic factor in these patients was the extent of disease at the time of presentation with an ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation (p less than .001). eighty-six percent of patients presenting with a unilateral or bilateral clinical stage le ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation, regardless of the histopathology or the immunophenotype, had a benign indolent clinical course and failed to develop ocular or extra-ocular lymphoma during a median follow-up period of 51 months. the results of this study substantially improve our understanding of extranodal small lymphocytic proliferations in general, and those of the ocular adnexa in particular.
@background is toxoplasma gondii infection a risk factor for leukemia? an evidence-based meta-analysis toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide prevalent pathogen that infects most of the warm-blood vertebrates. to investigate the regulation network of splenic mirnas altered by acute infection with t. gondii, we herein investigated the changes of mirna profile in mouse spleen via next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. a total of 379 mirnas was identified, 131 mirnas of them were differentially expressed (including 97 upregulated and 34 downregulated mirnas). 48 differentially expressed mirnas had validated targets in the mirwalk2.0 database. gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis revealed that the validated targets of differently expressed mirnas were significantly enriched in gene transcription regulation. it suggested that t. gondii can modulate host gene expression through targeting to trans-regulation factors. the genes involved in apoptosis or anti-apoptosis were both targeted by differentially expressed mirnas. the change of power balance between the mirnas targeting host apoptosis genes and those regulating host anti-apoptosis genes contributes to the fate of host apoptosis process. twelve pathways were significantly enriched in kegg analysis with most of them being cancer related, including pathways in cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, axon guidance, mapk signaling pathway, focal adhesion, chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, glioma, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and wnt signaling pathway. our study showed a changed mirna regulation network in mouse spleen infected by t. gondii. these findings will be helpful for better understanding of mirna regulation network in host-t. gondii interaction, revealing the relationship among t. gondii infection, gene regulation, apoptosis and cancer process alterations in infected spleen.
@background daytime cardiac repolarization in patients with obstructive sleep apnea background—whenever a proband is identified with long-qt syndrome (lqts), his or her parents and siblings should be evaluated regarding the possibility of carrying the disorder. in the majority of cases, one of the proband’s parents and one or more siblings are affected. the aim of this study was (1) to determine whether the clinical severity of lqts in the proband is useful in identifying first-degree family members at high risk for cardiac events, and (2) to evaluate the clinical course of affected parents and siblings of lqts probands. methods and results—the clinical and ecg characteristics of 211 lqts probands and 791 first-degree relatives (422 parents and 369 siblings) were studied to determine if the clinical profile of the proband is useful in determining the clinical severity of lqts in affected parents and siblings. affected female parents of an lqts proband had a greater cumulative risk for a first cardiac event than affected male parents. the probability of a parent or sibling having a first cardiac event was not significantly influenced by the severity of the proband’s clinical symptoms. female sex and qtc duration were risk factors for cardiac events among affected parents, and qtc was the only risk factor for cardiac events in affected siblings. conclusions—the severity profile of lqts in a proband was not found to be useful in identifying the clinical severity of lqts in affected first-degree relatives of the proband.
@method pre-restorative crown lengthening surgery outcomes: a systematic review. surgical crown lengthening has been proposed as a means of facilitating restorative procedures and preventing injuries in teeth with structurally inadequate clinical crown or exposing tooth structure in the presence of deep, subgingival pathologies which may hamper the access for proper restorative measures. histological studies utilizing animal models have shown that postoperative crestal resorption allowed reestablishment of the biologic width. however, very little has been done in humans. aims. the purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential changes in the periodontal tissues, particularly the biologic width, following surgical crown lengthening by two surgical procedures before and after crown placement. methods and material. twenty (20) patients who needed surgical crown lengthening to gain retention necessary for prosthetic treatment and/or to access caries, tooth fracture, or previous prosthetic margins entered the study. the following parameters were obtained from line angles of treated teeth (teeth requiring surgical crown lengthening) and adjacent sites: plaque and gingival indices (pi) & (gi), position of gingival margin from reference stent (pgmrs), probing depth (pd), and biologic width (bw). statistical analysis used. student “t” test. results. initial baseline values of biologic width were 2.55 mm (gingivectomy procedure b1 group) and 1.95 mm (ostectomy procedure b2 group) and after surgical procedure the values were 1.15 mm and 1.25 mm. conclusions. within the limitations of the study the biologic width, at treated sites, was re-established to its original vertical dimension by 3 months. ostectomy with apically positioned flap can be considered as a more effective procedure than gingivectomy for surgical crown lengthening.
@background consumption of acidic water alters the gut microbiome and decreases the risk of diabetes in nod mice the gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. how commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. we show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (sfb), is sufficient to induce the appearance of cd4(+) t helper cells that produce il-17 and il-22 (th17 cells) in the lamina propria. sfb adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few th17 cells. colonization with sfb was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen citrobacter rodentium. thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease.
@background metabolic risk markers in women with polycystic ovarian morphology objective the rotterdam criteria extend the phenotypic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). we characterized endocrine and metabolic differences among women meeting the national institutes of health (nih) definition for pcos vs two novel phenotypes established by the european society of human reproduction and embryology/american society for reproductive medicine definition.   study design endocrine and metabolic data from a retrospective analysis of 160 age- and weight-matched women with pcos and 23 controls were compared. insulin sensitivity indices were correlated with androgens, gonadotropins, and lipids within each phenotype.   results ovarian and adrenal androgens were highest in the nih-defined pcos group, lowest in the nonhyperandrogenic pcos group, and intermediate in the hyperandrogenic ovulatory pcos population. insulin sensitivity indices, gonadotropins, and lipids were similar across all pcos phenotypes. the magnitude of insulin resistance correlated with free testosterone only in the nih-defined group.   conclusion androgen levels are the major distinguishing endocrine feature differentiating phenotypic expressions of pcos. hyperinsulinemia correlates with free testosterone levels only in traditional nih-defined women with pcos.
@result the production of determiners: evidence from french in five picture-word interference experiments we explore the gender congruity effect observed in dutch in two languages, spanish and catalan. participants' performance was not affected by the relationship between the gender of the picture and the gender of the word. the results show that the gender congruity effect is not a universal effect, but varies from language to language, depending on crucial characteristics of the gender/determiner selection system used to process a given language. consistent with the crosslinguistic hypothesis presented by miozzo and caramazza we argue that the retrieval of the noun's gender is enough to specify the determiner's phonological form in dutch, but not in catalan or spanish, and this is the cause of the failure to replicate the dutch results in these two languages.
@background ubiquitous associations and a peak fall prevalence between apicomplexan symbionts and reef corals in florida and the bahamas this report documents the extent to which coral colonies show fluctuations in their associations with different endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. the genetic identity of symbiodinium from six coral species [acropora palmata (lamarck), a. cervicornis (lamarck), siderastrea siderea (ellis and solander), montastrea faveolata (ellis and solander), m. annularis (ellis and solander), and m. franksi (gregory)] was examined seasonally over five years (1998 and 2000–2004) in the bahamas and florida keys at shallow (1 to 4 m) fore-reef/patch reef sites and at deeper fore-reef (12–15 m) locations. symbionts were identified genetically using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (its2) of ribosomal rna gene loci. repetitive sampling from most labeled colonies from the bahamas and the florida keys showed little to no change in their dominant symbiont. in contrast, certain colonies of m. annularis and m. franksi from the florida keys exhibited shifts in their associations attributed to recovery from the stresses of the 1997–1998 el niño southern oscillation (enso) event. over several years, a putatively stress-tolerant clade d type of symbiodinium was progressively replaced in these colonies by symbionts typically found in m. annularis and m. franksi in florida and at other caribbean locations. greater environmental fluctuations in florida may explain the observed changes among some of the symbioses. furthermore, symbiotic associations were more heterogeneous at shallow sites, relative to deep sites. the exposure to greater environmental variability near the surface may explain the higher symbiont diversity found within and between host colonies.
@background cyclin‐dependent kinase‐dependent phosphorylation of lif1 and sae2 controls imprecise nonhomologous end joining accompanied by double‐strand break resection the mre11 complex functions in double-strand break (dsb) repair, meiotic recombination, and dna damage checkpoint pathways. sae2 deficiency has opposing effects on the mre11 complex. on one hand, it appears to impair mre11 nuclease function in dna repair and meiotic dsb processing, and on the other, sae2 deficiency activates mre11-complex-dependent dna-damage-signaling via the tel1–mre11 complex (tm) pathway. we demonstrate that sae2 overexpression blocks the tm pathway, suggesting that sae2 antagonizes mre11-complex checkpoint functions. to understand how sae2 regulates the mre11 complex, we screened for sae2 alleles that behaved as the null with respect to mre11-complex checkpoint functions, but left nuclease function intact. phenotypic characterization of these sae2 alleles suggests that sae2 functions as a multimer and influences the substrate specificity of the mre11 nuclease. we show that sae2 oligomerizes independently of dna damage and that oligomerization is required for its regulatory influence on the mre11 nuclease and checkpoint functions.
@background nod2 signaling contributes to host defense in the lungs against escherichia coli infection staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections including the life-threatening conditions endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and septicemia. toll-like receptor (tlr)-2, a membrane-bound microbial sensor, detects staphylococcal components, but macrophages lacking tlr2 or both tlr2 and tlr4 remain s. aureus responsive, suggesting that an alternative microbial recognition receptor might be involved. the cytoplasmic sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing (nod) 2/caspase recruitment domain (card) 15 detects muramyl dipeptide from bacterial peptidoglycans and mediates cytokine responses to s. aureus in vitro, but the physiological significance of these observations is not well defined. here we show that nod2-deficient mice exhibit a delayed but ultimately exacerbated ulcerative response and impaired bacterial clearance after s.c. infection with s. aureus. nod2-dependent recognition of s. aureus and muramyl dipeptide is facilitated by α-toxin (α-hemolysin), a pore-forming toxin and virulence factor of the pathogen. the action of nod2 is dependent on il-1β-amplified production of il-6, which promotes rapid bacterial killing by neutrophils. these results significantly broaden the physiological importance of nod2 in innate immunity from the recognition of bacteria that primarily enter the cytoplasm to the detection of bacteria that typically reside extracellularly and demonstrate that this microbial sensor contributes to the discrimination between commensal bacteria and bacterial pathogens that elaborate pore-forming toxins.
@background a category-based equational logic semantics to constraint programming equational deduction is generalised within a category-based abstract model theory framework, and proved complete under a hypothesis of quantifier projectivity, using a semantic treatment that regards quantifiers as models rather than variables, and valuations as model morphisms rather than functions. applications include many- and order-sorted (conditional) equational logics, horn clause logic, equational deduction modulo a theory, constraint logics, and more, as well as any possible combination among them. in the cases of equational deduction modulo a theory and of constraint logic the completeness result is new. one important consequence is an abstract version of herbrand's theorem, which provides an abstract model theoretic foundation for equational and constraint logic programming.
@result comparison between skeletal, and facial measurements of vertical dimension in edentulous patients in a group of nine dentate students with a mean age of 23.1 years, a comparison of their interocclusal distances was determined using tooth and chin reference points. this determination was made with two reference leds, one attached to a lower tooth and the other attached to a point on the chin. these two leds were registered simultaneously using the selspot system and analyzed with the use of a computer. three different methods were used to establish the interocclusal distance: a phonetic method, a relaxation method, and a swallowing method. independent of the method selected, there was a greater interocclusal distance recorded by the tooth-attached reference led. this study indicates that, in the clinical determination of interocclusal distance, where a chin reference is used the dentist should be aware of this difference--especially when lip activity is involved.
@method systematic review, network meta-analysis and economic evaluation of biological therapy for the management of active psoriatic arthritis indirect and mixed treatment comparison (mtc) approaches to synthesis are logical extensions of more established meta-analysis methods. they have great potential for estimating the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments using an evidence base of trials that individually do not compare all treatment options. connected networks of evidence can be synthesized simultaneously to provide estimates of the comparative effectiveness of all included treatments and a ranking of their effectiveness with associated probability statements.the potential of the use of indirect and mtc methods in technology assessment is considerable, and would allow for a more consistent assessment than simpler alternative approaches. although such models can be viewed as a logical and coherent extension of standard pair-wise meta-analysis, their increased complexity raises some unique issues with far-reaching implications concerning how we use data in technology assessment, while simultaneously raising searching questions about standard pair-wise meta-analysis. this article reviews pair-wise meta-analysis and indirect and mtc approaches to synthesis, clearly outlining the assumptions involved in each approach. it also raises the issues that the national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) needed to consider in updating their 2004 guide to the methods of technology appraisal, if such methods are to be used in their technology appraisals.
@background lipopolysaccharide stress induces cell-type specific production of murine leukemia virus type-endogenous retroviral virions in primary lymphoid cells we have determined the 8,332-nucleotide structure of the genome of moloney murine leukaemia virus. the coding frame for the gag gene is the same as that for pol, separated only by a single amber triplet. the pol gene encodes 132,000 daltons of protein, larger than the 70,000 daltons required for the reverse transcriptase. the env gene overlaps the pol gene.
@background kinematic and temporospatial assessment of habituation of labrador retrievers to treadmill trotting. the current state of canine kinetic and kinematic gait analysis, as developed for the objective description of movement for the study of musculoskeletal disease and lameness, is reviewed. basic terminology of gait is discussed. ground reaction forces, dynamic flexion, and extension angles and angular velocities are described for the canine walk and trot and for lameness in cranial cruciate ligament rupture and canine hip dysplasia.
@method team preceptorship model: a solution for students' clinical experience content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique. rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. all three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. the major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. in conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. with a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. a summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. the authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.

@background omega-3 fatty acid levels in red blood cell membranes and physical decline over 3 years: longitudinal data from the mapt study the effects of manipulating dietary levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids on the function of isolated skeletal muscles in male wistar rats were examined. three isoenergetic diets were used: an essential fatty acid-deficient diet (efad), a diet high in essential (n-6) fatty acids [high (n-6)], and a diet enriched with essential (n-3) fatty acids [high (n-3)]. after 9 wk, groups of rats on each test diet were fed a stock diet of laboratory chow for a further 6 wk. muscle function was examined by using a battery of five tests for soleus (slow twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (edl; fast twitch). tests included single muscle twitches, sustained tetanic contractions, posttetanic potentiation, sustained high-frequency stimulation, and intermittent low-frequency stimulation. results for muscles from the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups were very similar. however, the efad diet resulted in significantly lower muscular tensions and reduced response times compared with the high (n-6) and high (n-3) diets. peak twitch tension in soleus muscles was 16-21% less in the efad group than in the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups, respectively [analysis of variance (anova), p < 0.01). during high-frequency stimulation, edl muscles from the efad rats fatigued 32% more quickly (anova, p < 0.01)]. also, twitch contraction and half-relaxation times were significantly 5-7% reduced in the efad group (anova, p < 0.01). during intermittent low-frequency stimulation, soleus muscles from the efad group generated 25-28% less tension than did the other groups (anova, p < 0.01), but in edl muscles from the efad group, endurance was 20% greater than in the high (n-6) group (anova, p < 0.05). after 6 wk on the stock diet, there were no longer any differences between the dietary groups. manipulation of dietary fatty acids results in significant, but reversible, effects in muscles of rats fed an efad diet.
@method minireviews s 1 p signaling and de novo biosynthesis in blood pressure homeostasis sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk1) and sphk2 are ubiquitous enzymes that generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p), a ligand for a family of g protein-coupled receptors (s1pr1-s1pr5) with important functions in the vascular and immune systems. here we explore the role of these kinases and receptors in recovery from anaphylaxis in mice. we found that sphk2-/- mice had a rapid recovery from anaphylaxis. in contrast, sphk1-/- mice showed poor recovery from anaphylaxis and delayed histamine clearance. injection of s1p into sphk1-/- mice increased histamine clearance and promoted recovery from anaphylaxis. adoptive cell transfer experiments demonstrated that sphk1 activity was required in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments for recovery from anaphylaxis. mice lacking the s1p receptor s1pr2 also showed a delay in plasma histamine clearance and a poor recovery from anaphylaxis. however, s1p did not promote the recovery of s1pr2-/- mice from anaphylaxis, whereas s1pr2+/- mice showed partial recovery. unlike sphk2-/- mice, sphk1-/- and s1pr2-/- mice had severe hypotension during anaphylaxis. thus, sphk1-produced s1p regulates blood pressure, histamine clearance, and recovery from anaphylaxis in a manner that involves s1pr2. this suggests that specific s1pr2 agonists may serve to counteract the vasodilation associated with anaphylactic shock.
@method protection of retinal ganglion cells from natural and axotomy-induced cell death in neonatal transgenic mice overexpressing bcl-2 the patterns of cell death and division are described in the normal postnatal rat retina and following transection of the optic nerve on the day of birth. optic nerve transection on the day of birth results in the rapid degeneration of the ganglion cells. mitosis at the outer retinal surface ceases first in the temporal retina, then in the nasal retina and becomes progressively more restricted to peripheral regions. mitotic activity was not affected by the loss of ganglion cells. cell death takes place in a wave passing from the ganglion cell to the inner nuclear to the outer nuclear layer. the time course of cell death is not affected by the loss of ganglion cells following optic nerve transection, and there is no significant increase in the number of cells which degenerate in the inner nuclear layer. the effects of removing a major postsynaptic target of local circuit neurones appears to be less pronounced than has been reported for relay neurones.
@result a comparative study with rosuvastatin in subjects with metabolic syndrome: results of the comets study. emerging data suggest that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase inhibitors (statins) offer important benefits for the large population of individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease. this population encompasses a sizable portion of individuals who are also at high risk for drug-drug interactions due to their need for multiple medications. in general, statins are associated with a very small risk for myopathy (which may progress to fatal or nonfatal rhabdomyolysis); however, the potential for drug-drug interactions is known to increase this risk in specific high-risk groups. the incidence of myopathy associated with statin therapy is dose related and is increased when statins are used in combination with agents that share common metabolic pathways. of particular concern is the potential for interactions with other lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates and niacin (nicotinic acid), which may be used in patients with mixed lipidemia, and with immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, which are commonly used in patients after transplantation. clinicians should be alert to the potential for drug-drug interactions to minimize the risk of myopathy during long-term statin therapy in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.
@background brain hypoxanthine concentration correlates to lactate/pyruvate ratio but not intracranial pressure in patients with acute liver failure. aimhyperammonemia causes brain edema and high intracranial pressure (icp) in acute liver failure (alf) by accumulation of glutamine in brain. since a high-level glutamine may compromise mitochondrial function, the aim of this study was to determine if the lactate–pyruvate ratio is associated with a rise in the glutamine concentration and icp.patients and methodsin 13 patients with alf (8f/5m; median age 46 (range 18–66) years) the cerebral extracellular concentrations of glutamine, lactate, and pyruvate were measured by in vivo brain microdialysis together with icp and cerebral perfusion pressure (cpp).resultsthe cerebral glutamine concentration was 4,396 (1,011–9,712) μm, lactate 2.15 (1.1–4.45) mm, and pyruvate 101 (43–255) μm. the lactate–pyruvate ratio was 21 (16–40), icp 20 (2–28) mmhg, and cpp 72 (56–115) mmhg. cerebral glutamine concentration correlated with the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). also the icp, but not cpp, correlated to the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.64, p < 0.05).conclusionicp and the cerebral glutamine concentration in patients with alf correlate to the lactate–pyruvate ratio. since cpp was sufficient in all patients the rise in lactate–pyruvate ratio indicates that accumulation of glutamine compromises mitochondrial function and causes intracranial hypertension.
@method diabetes reduces mesenchymal stem cells in fracture healing through a tnfα-mediated mechanism chemokines are thought to play an important role in several aspects of bone metabolism including the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of osteoclasts. we investigated the impact of diabetes on chemokine expression in normal and diabetic fracture healing. fracture of the femur was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and matched normoglycemic control mice. microarray analysis was carried out and chemokine mrna levels in vivo were assessed. ccl4 were examined in fracture calluses by immunohistochemistry and the role of tnf in diabetes-enhanced expression was investigated by treatment of animals with the tnf-specific inhibitor, pegsunercept. in vitro studies were conducted with atdc5 chondrocytes. diabetes significantly upregulated mrna levels of several chemokines in vivo including ccl4, ccl8, ccl6, ccl11, ccl20, ccl24, cxcl2, cxcl5 and chemokine receptors ccr5 and cxcr4. chondrocytes were identified as a significant source of ccl4 and its expression in diabetic fractures was dependent on tnf (p<0.05). tnf-α significantly increased mrna levels of several chemokines in vitro which were knocked down with foxo1 sirna (p<0.05). ccl4 expression at the mrna and proteins levels was induced by foxo1 over-expression and reduced by foxo1 knockdown. the current studies point to the importance of tnf-α as a mechanism for diabetes enhanced chemokine expression by chondrocytes, which may contribute to the accelerated loss of cartilage observed in diabetic fracture healing. moreover, in vitro results point to foxo1 as a potentially important transcription factor in mediating this effect.
@background reactive oxygen species and oxidative dna damage mediate the cytotoxicity of tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys in vitro. caspases, a family of cysteine proteases most often investigated for their roles in apoptosis, have also been demonstrated to have functions that are vital for the efficient execution of cell differentiation. one such role that has been described is the requirement of caspase-3 for the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes but, as yet, the mechanism leading to caspase-3 activation in this case remains elusive. here, we demonstrate that caspase-9, an initiator caspase in the mitochondrial death pathway, is responsible for the activation of caspase-3 in differentiating c2c12 cells. reduction of caspase-9 levels, using an shrna construct, prevented caspase-3 activation and inhibited myoblast fusion. myosin-heavy-chain expression, which accompanies myoblastic differentiation, was not caspase-dependent. overexpression of bcl-xl, a protein that inhibits caspase-9 activation, had the same effect on muscle differentiation as knockdown of caspase-9. these data suggest that the mitochondrial pathway is required for differentiation; however, the release of cytochrome c or smac (diablo) could not be detected, raising the possibility of a novel mechanism of caspase-9 activation during muscle differentiation.
@method regulatory snapshots: integrative mining of regulatory modules from expression time series and regulatory networks a large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. however, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. this limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. a similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. for this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. the goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. in this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. in this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.
@result hmga2 is a direct target gene of runx1 and regulates expansion of myeloid progenitors in mice. we present model-based analysis of chip-seq data, macs, which analyzes data generated by short read sequencers such as solexa's genome analyzer. macs empirically models the shift size of chip-seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. macs also uses a dynamic poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions. macs compares favorably to existing chip-seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.
@background reflective and formative metrics of relationship value: a commentary essay during the last years cooperative buyer-seller relationships in industrial markets were more and more discovered as instruments of strategy. while quite a number of publications emphasize the role of the concept of relationship value for the management of cooperative buyer-seller relationships, only very limited empirical research has been done on this topic so far. therefore, this paper describes a large-scale, three-step empirical study that is aimed at conceptualizing and measuring the value of cooperative business relationships from both buyer and supplier perspective using methods of multivariate analysis. results show that benefits and sacrifice may be considered as building blocks of relationship value, with relationship benefits being the main value drivers.
@method aspects of sound localization and spatial attention in barn owls and rats the topographical relations of the visual field with the superior colliculus of the rat was investigated using constant small visual stimuli and recording the electrical response of aggregate unit activity with fine tip metal microelectrodes. a precise essentially linear projection onto the contralateral colliculus was demonstrated after appropriate corrections for brain curvature were performed. the general pattern and arrangement of the retinotopic projection is similar to that found in infra‐mammalian vertebrates. an ipsilateral projection appears to be absent. the phasic properties and rhythmic discharge patterns of single units in the coliculus were studied with stationary and moving luminous stimuli.
@background stabilizing exposure of conserved epitopes by structure guided insertion of disulfide bond in hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein abstract the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 exterior gp120 envelope glycoprotein is highly flexible, and this flexibility may contribute to the inability of monomeric gp120 immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. we previously showed that an s375w modification of a critical interfacial cavity central to the primary receptor binding site, the phe43 cavity, stabilizes gp120 into the cd4-bound state. however, the immunological effects of this cavity-altering replacement were never tested. subsequently, we screened other mutations that, along with the s375w alteration, might further stabilize the cd4-bound state. here, we define a selected second cavity-altering replacement, t257s, and analyze the double mutations in several gp120 envelope glycoprotein contexts. the gp120 glycoproteins with the t257s-plus-s375w double mutation (t257s+s375w) have a superior antigenic profile compared to the originally identified single s375w replacement in terms of enhanced recognition by the broadly neutralizing cd4 binding-site antibody b12. isothermal titration calorimetry measuring the entropy of the gp120 interaction with cd4 indicated that the double mutant was also stabilized into the cd4-bound state, with increasing relative fixation between core, full-length monomeric, and full-length trimeric versions of gp120. a significant increase in gp120 affinity for cd4 was also observed for the cavity-filling mutants relative to wild-type gp120. the most conformationally constrained t257s+s375w trimeric gp120 proteins were selected for immunogenicity analysis in rabbits and displayed a trend of improvement relative to their wild-type counterparts in terms of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. together, the results suggest that conformational stabilization may improve the ability of gp120 to elicit neutralizing antibodies.
@result herpes zoster by reactivated vaccine varicella zoster virus in a healthy child background the oka strain of live attenuated varicella vaccine is immunogenic and highly protective, but there has been concern about the risk of zoster after immunization.   methods we examined the incidence of zoster, risk factors for it, and measures of immune response in children with leukemia who received the vaccine and in appropriate controls.   results after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, zoster was documented in 13 of the 548 vaccinated children with leukemia (2.4 percent). in a subgroup of 96 vaccinated children matched prospectively with 96 children with leukemia who had had natural varicella infections, there were 4 cases of zoster among the vaccinated children and 15 among the controls, for crude incidence rates of 0.80 and 2.46 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (p = 0.01). of the total of 13 vaccinated children who had zoster, 11 had a skin rash due to varicella-zoster virus, either from the vaccine itself or from breakthrough varicella after household exposure in the period between immunization and the documentation of zoster. in the 268 children who had any type of rash caused by varicella-zoster virus after vaccination, as compared with those who did not have a rash, the relative risk of subsequent zoster was 5.75. for the 21 vaccinated children who received bone marrow transplants, as compared with those who did not, the relative risk of zoster was 7.5. cell-mediated immunity as assessed by lymphocyte stimulation was lower in 4 children in whom zoster later developed than in 29 controls who had been vaccinated but who did not have zoster (mean stimulation index, 5.1 vs. 23.8; p = 0.0001).   conclusions in children with leukemia who receive the live attenuated varicella vaccine, the subsequent incidence of zoster is lower than in children who have natural varicella infections.
@background a high performing meta-heuristic for training support vector regression in performance forecasting of supply chain a comprehensive look at learning and generalization theory. the statistical theory of learning and generalization concerns the problem of choosing desired functions on the basis of empirical data. highly applicable to a variety of computer science and robotics fields, this book offers lucid coverage of the theory as a whole. presenting a method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of learning process, the author covers function estimates from small data pools, applying these estimations to real-life problems, and much more.
@background metabolic responses to oral tryptophan supplementation before exercise in horses. it has been hypothesized that fatigue and prolactin (prl) changes during endurance exercise are influenced by serotonin synthesis, and in turn, release. such a change is thought to occur through an increase in blood free tryptophan (trp) and a concomitant decrease in those large neutral amino acids (lnaa) which compete with free trp for entry into the brain. for further investigation, 10 healthy athletes were randomly subjected to three test units (tu), each consisting of a treadmill run for 90 min. the speed was adjusted to a blood lactate level of 2 mmol/l. during the first 30 min of exercise infusions of 500 ml saline (tu i), 500 ml saline with amino acids (tu ii) or 500 ml saline with 30 u heparin/kg following an oral soy oil solution given 1 h before (tu iii) were administered. rate of perceived exertion (rpe), heart rate and running speed were recorded during exercise. venous blood samples were taken after a 10 h fast, at rest, after 10, 50 and 90 min of exercise as well as 10 and 30 min post-exercise. prl, insulin, glucose, ammonia, lactate, triglycerides (tg), free fatty acids (ffa) and amino acids were determined in each sample. no significant differences were found in rpe. prl increased (p < 0.01) in all tu. tg and heparin administration resulted in an increase (p <0.01) in ffa, which correlated (p < 0.01) with free trp and the ratio of free trp/trp. artificial increase in free trp in tu iii did not affect plasma prl level. the amino acid infusion in tu ii induced an increase in lnaa but had no significant effect on prl. prl and ammonia peaked at the end of exercise. we conclude that neither exercise-induced prl secretion nor rpe are affected by changes in circulating free trp and lnaa under the present conditions.
@method oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnoea is greater in women compared with men the oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnea (v˙(o2 rm)) has been quantified using a variety of techniques with inconsistent findings. between-study variation relates to poor control of breathing patterns and lung mechanics. we developed a methodology allowing precise matching of exercising wob in order to estimate v˙(o2 rm). thirteen healthy young subjects (7 male) completed an incremental cycle exercise test, familiarization and experimental days where exercise hyperpnea was mimicked. on experimental days, feedback of exercise flow, volume and the respiratory pressures were provided while end-tidal co2 was kept at exercise levels during each 5-min trial. minute ventilation levels between 50 and 100% maximum were mimicked 3-5 times. the r(2) between exercise and mimic trails was 0.99 for frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation; 0.86 for esophageal pressure swings and 0.93 for wob. the coefficient of variation for (v˙(o2) averaged 4.3, 4.4 and 5.7% for 50, 75 and 100% ventilation trials. when wob and other respiratory parameters are tightly controlled, the v˙(o2 rm) can be consistently estimated.
@method pattern recognition we present a fast line segment tracker which does not require any knowledge about the motion of the camera nor the structure of the observed scene. it runs on 320 times 240 pixel images at 30 hz. we adapted the rapid tracker with a new way of handling multiple line hypotheses to deal with the simple model of a single line segment. we discuss the difficulty of using a chi2-test as merging criterion and also present a new approach to overcome it. furthermore, instead of making assumptions about the camera motion, a constant velocity motion model to predict the line segment position in the following frame is used. we explain how to deal with the instability of the endpoint extraction in this motion model to avoid unintentional motion along the line. finally, we present results on real world indoor and urban outdoor image sequences.
@method the nature of lexical-semantic access in bilingual aphasia purpose the effect of semantic naming treatment on crosslinguistic generalization was investigated in 3 participants with english-spanish bilingual aphasia.   method a single-subject experimental designed was used. participants received semantic treatment to improve naming of english or spanish items, while generalization was tested to untrained semantically related items in the trained language and translations of the trained and untrained items in the untrained language.   results results demonstrated a within- and across-languages effect on generalization related to premorbid language proficiencies. participant 1 (p1; equal premorbid proficiency across languages) showed within-language generalization in the trained language (spanish) as well as crosslinguistic generalization to the untrained language (english). participant 2 (p2) and participant (p3) were more proficient premorbidly in english. with treatment in english, p2 showed within-language generalization to semantically related items, but no crosslinguistic generalization. with treatment in spanish, both p2 and p3 exhibited no within-language generalization, but crosslinguistic generalization to english (dominant language) occurred. error analyses indicated an evolution of errors as a consequence of treatment.   conclusions these results are preliminary because all participants were not treated in both languages. however, the results suggest that training the less dominant language may be more beneficial in facilitating crosslinguistic generalization than training the more proficient language in an unbalanced bilingual individual.
@background pathway shifts and thermal softening in temperature-coupled forced unfolding of spectrin domains. using a modified atomic force microscope (afm), individual double-stranded (ds) dna molecules attached to an afm tip and a gold surface were overstretched, and the mechanical stability of the dna double helix was investigated. in lambda-phage dna the previously reported b-s transition at 65 piconewtons (pn) is followed by a second conformational transition, during which the dna double helix melts into two single strands. unlike the b-s transition, the melting transition exhibits a pronounced force-loading-rate dependence and a marked hysteresis, characteristic of a nonequilibrium conformational transition. the kinetics of force-induced melting of the double helix, its reannealing kinetics, as well as the influence of ionic strength, temperature, and dna sequence on the mechanical stability of the double helix were investigated. as expected, the dna double helix is considerably destabilized under low salt buffer conditions (</=10 mm nacl), while high ionic strength buffers (1 m nacl) stabilize the double-helical conformation. the mechanical energy that can be deposited in the dna double helix before force induced melting occurs was found to decrease with increasing temperature. this energy correlates with the base-pairing free enthalpy deltag(bp)(t) of dna. experiments with pure poly(dg-dc) and poly(da-dt) dna sequences again revealed a close correlation between the mechanical energies at which these sequences melt with base pairing free enthalpies deltag(bp)(sequence): while the melting transition occurs between 65 and 200 pn in lambda-phage dna, depending on the loading rate, the melting transition is shifted to approximately 300 pn for poly(dg-dc) dna, whereas poly(da-dt) dna melts at a force of 35 pn.
@background effect of moringa oleifera lam. seed extract on toluene diisocyanate-induced immune-mediated inflammatory responses in rats diisocyanates are highly reactive compounds widely used, for example, in the production of polyure-thane foams, elastomers, paints, and adhesives. the high chemical reactivity of these compounds is also reflected in their toxicity: diisocyanates are one of the most important causes of occupational asthma but also other adverse effects, such as irritation and toxic reactions, have been described in exposed subjects. one of the open questions is whether occupational isocyanate exposure is a carcinogenic hazard. the few epidemiological studies available have been based on young cohorts and short follow-up and are not conclusive. toluene diisocyanate (tdi) has been classified as carcinogenic in animals on the basis of gavage administration studies, but no conclusions are available on inhalation exposure. for 4,4′-methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (mdi) there is suggestive evidence for carcinoge-nicity in rats. the possible carcinogenic mechanism of tdi and mdi is not clear. both chemicals have been positive in a number of short-term tests inducing gene mutations and chromosomal damage. the reactive form could be either the diisocyanate itself or may derive from the metabolic activation of the aromatic diamine derivatives formed by hydrolysis. tdi and mdi react with dna in vivo and in vitro. however, the structure of the adducts has not been identified. especially from the in vivo experiment it is not known if the adducts are a product from the reaction with the isocyanate or the corresponding amine. in conclusion, both tdi and mdi are highly reactive chemicals that bind to dna and are probably genotoxic. the alleged animal carcinogenicity of tdi and mdi would suggest that occupational exposure to these compounds is a carcinogenic risk. the few epidemiological studies available have not, however, been able to clarify if tdi and mdi are occupational carcinogens.
@result in vitro vla-4 blockade results in an impaired nk cell-mediated immune surveillance against melanoma. background natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against α₄ integrin used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms). four cases of melanomas occurring in patients prescribed natalizumab to treat ms were recently reported. although some fundamental data suggested that α₄β1 integrin could be linked to the invasiveness of melanoma, none showed any relation with the transformation of melanocytes.   observations we performed a prospective follow-up of a cohort of patients with ms treated with natalizumab to assess the evolution of nevi under treatment. clinical dermatologic examination and videodermoscopy were performed every 6 months. nevi were compared side-by-side with baseline photographs, and histologic analysis was proposed based on clinical and dermoscopic criteria. forty-four patients were included, and 248 nevi were examined and followed up. the mean duration of follow-up was 14 months (range, 6-20 months). seventeen lesions (6.8%) showed modifications over time. only 12 (4.8%) presented substantial dermoscopic changes. five lesions were removed. all of them were classified as benign after histologic examination.   conclusions our results showed the same rate of clinical and dermoscopic changes of nevi during treatment with natalizumab compared with the spontaneous evolution of nevi reported in literature. in accordance with fundamental data, those results suggest that the inhibition of the α₄ integrin does not promote the transformation of melanocytic lesions.
@method flow sensing in developing xenopus laevis is disrupted by visual cues and ototoxin exposure hair cells of the lateral line system in fish may differ in their susceptibility to damage by aminoglycoside antibiotics. gentamicin has been reported to damage hair cells within canal neuromasts, but not those within superficial neuromasts. this finding, based on sem imaging, indicates a distinction in the physiology of hair cells between the two classes of neuromast. studies concerned with the individual roles of canal and superficial neuromasts in behavior have taken advantage of this effect in an attempt to selectively disable canal neuromasts without affecting superficial neuromast function. here we present an experimental test of the hypothesis that canal neuromasts are more vulnerable to gentamicin than superficial neuromasts. we measured the effect of gentamicin exposure on hair cells using vital stains (daspei and fm1-43) in the neuromasts of mexican blind cave fish (astyanaxfasciatus) and zebrafish (daniorerio). contrary to the findings of prior studies that used sem, gentamicin significantly reduced dye uptake by hair cells of both canal and superficial neuromasts in both species. therefore, lateral line hair cells of both neuromast types are vulnerable to gentamicin ototoxicity. these findings argue for a re-evaluation of the results of studies that have used gentamicin to differentiate the roles of the two classes of neuromast in fish behavior.
@method unannounced telephone-based pill counts: a valid and feasible method for monitoring adherence objectives many questionnaires on adherence to antiretroviral therapy are in use, but the validity of patients’ responses has not been tested. the medication adherence self-report inventory (masri) has been developed and tested for its validity against objective measures and treatment outcome. design prospective study comparing questionnaire responses with mems trackcap (mc, a medication event monitoring system), pill count (pc) and plasma hiv viraemia in a publicly funded specialist hiv clinic. participants patients self-medicating antiretroviral therapy who were not cognitively impaired and were able to read and understand english. results mean adherence by mc of the 78 subjects was 92.9% (se, 1.8%) and by pc 96.8% (se, 1.4%). agreement between mc and responses to items about doses missed 1, 2 or 3 days ago was low (κ = 0.23 (p < 0.03), 0.44 (p < 0.001) and 0.28 (p < 0.01) respectively). this improved when these responses were summated (κ = 0.46;p < 0.001) and was similar to that for recall of non-adherence over the preceding 2 weeks (κ = 0.54;p < 0.001). mean self-reported adherence by visual analogue scale (vas) over the preceding month was 93.3% (se, 1.2%). this was strongly associated with both mc (r = 0.63;p < 0.001) and pc (r = 0.75;p < 0.001). on multivariate analysis, the strongest association between a masri item and mc was for the vas. both the 2 week recall and vas items were inversely associated with viral load (p = 0.01). there was no association between dose timing (measured mc or questionnaire) or 3 day self-report and viral load. conclusions the masri provides a means of measuring patient adherence that is valid when compared with objective measures.
@background unique distribution of aromatase in the human brain: in vivo studies with pet and [n‐methyl‐11c]vorozole abstract four rhesus monkeys were surgically implanted with arrays of subcortical electrodes and trained to self-administer rewarding electrical stimulation (icss) to the hypothalamus. in all four animals, concurrent electrical stimulation of the ca3 region of uncal anterior hippocampus or of the cortico-medial region of amygdala inhibited hypothalamic icss. in two of the four animals, concurrent stimulation of the more posterior hippocampus (ca3) facilitated icss. concurrent stimulation of other areas (including basolateral amygdala, hippocampal ca4 region, internal capsule, optic tract, thalamus, and caudate nucleus) had no effect on hypothalamic icss. it is suggested that hypothalamic reinforcement processes may vary according to the parameters of limbic involvement.
@background first report of babesia gibsoni in central america and survey for vector-borne infections in dogs from nicaragua two species of hepatozoon are currently known to infect dogs and cause distinct diseases. hepatozoon canis prevalent in africa, asia, southern europe, south america and recently shown to be present also in the usa causes infection mainly of hemolymphoid organs, whereas hepatozoon americanum prevalent in the southeastern usa causes myositis and severe lameness. h. americanum is transmitted by ingestion of the gulf coast tick amblyomma maculatum and also by predation on infected prey. h. canis is transmitted by rhipicephalus sanguineus, in south america also by amblyomma ovale, and has also been shown to be transmitted transplacentally. hepatozoonosis of domestic cats has been described mostly from the same areas where canine infection is present and the exact identity of the species which infect cats, their pathogenicity and vectors have not been elucidated. the diagnosis of hepatozoonosis is made by observation of gamonts in blood smears, histopathology, pcr or serology. the main treatment for h. canis is with imidocarb dipropionate whereas h. americanum infection is treated with an initial combination of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine and clindamycin followed by maintenance with decoquinate. treatment for both diseases has not been reported to facilitate complete parasite elimination and new effective drugs are needed for the management of these infections. prevention of hepatozoonosis should be based on avoidance of oral ingestion of infected tick vectors and infected prey.
@method climbing time to exhaustion is a determinant of climbing performance in high-level sport climbers objectives to assess oxygen uptake (vo2), blood lactate concentration ([la(b)]), and heart rate (hr) response during indoor and outdoor sport climbing.   methods seven climbers aged 25 (se 1) years, with a personal best ascent without preview or fall (on sight) ranging from 6b to 7a were assessed using an indoor vertical treadmill with artificial rock hand/foot holds and a discontinuous protocol with climbing velocity incremented until voluntary fatigue. on a separate occasion the subjects performed a 23.4 m outdoor rock climb graded 5c and taking 7 min 36 s (se 33 s) to complete. cardiorespiratory parameters were measured using a telemetry system and [la(b)] collected at rest and after climbing.   results indoor climbing elicited a peak oxygen uptake (vo2climb-peak) and peak hr (hrpeak) of 43.8 (se 2.2) ml/kg/min and 190 (se 4) bpm, respectively and increased blood lactate concentration [la(b)] from 1.4 (0.1) to 10.2 (0.6) mmol/l (p < 0.05). during outdoor climbing vo2 and hr increased to about 75% and 83% of vo2climb-peak and hrpeak, respectively. [la(b)] increased from 1.3 (0.1) at rest to 4.5 mmol/l (p < 0.05) at 2 min 32 s (8 s) after completion of the climb.   conclusions the results suggest that for elite climbers outdoor sport rock climbs of five to 10 minutes' duration and moderate difficulty require a significant portion of the vo2climb-peak. the higher hr and vo2 for outdoor climbing and the increased [la(b)] could be the result of repeated isometric contractions, particularly from the arm and forearm muscles.
@background phenotypic and functional separation of memory and effector human cd 8 1 t cells cd27, a lymphocyte-specific member of the tnf/ngf-r family, is expressed on the majority of peripheral blood t cells. activation of t cells via tcr/cd3 induces high cd27 surface expression and the release of a soluble extracellular part of the molecule. after prolonged activation in vitro, cd27 becomes gradually switched off. there is evidence that also in vivo, cd4+ cells that have persistently been stimulated by ag, accumulate within the cd45ra-cd27- subset. in addition, an increase of cd27- t cells has been observed under certain immunopathologic conditions and during aging. this study was undertaken to analyze the regulation of cd27 on different t-cell subsets and to determine whether the loss of cd27 expression is an irreversible event and may thereby mark t-cell differentiation. in agreement with earlier findings, all cd4+cd45ra+cd45ro- t cells were found to express cd27, whereas a small fraction of the cd4+cd45ra-cd45ro+ subset lacks the molecule. in contrast, within the cd8+ compartment cd27- subsets were found both in the cd45ra+ and cd45ra- subpopulations. after stimulation with cd3 mab, both cd27 membrane expression and release was equally up-regulated in cd4+ and cd8+ subpopulations. this stimulus, however, provoked a strikingly predominant up-regulation of membrane cd27 on cd45ro- cells as compared with cd45ra- cells. on cd4+cd45ra-cd27- t cells and long-term grown cd45ra-cd27- tlc, cd27 expression could not be reinduced after stimulation of the tcr/cd3 complex, neither at the protein nor at the mrna level. comparison of cd27 expression with its structural homologue fas/apo-1 showed that down-regulation after prolonged activation is not a general feature of tnf/ngf-r family members. the cd27 ligand was recently identified and was shown to give a co-stimulatory signal to pha-activated t cells. the restricted up-regulation of cd27 on cd45ra+ cells after t-cell stimulation may point at a discrete role of cd27-cd27 ligand interaction during transition of cd45ro- to cd45ra- t cells. in addition, the cd27 negative phenotype seems a stable reflection of differentiation rather than of activation.
@method the interaction of deworming, improved sanitation, and household flooring with soil-transmitted helminth infection in rural bangladesh abstract in this tutorial, we provide a broad introduction to the topic of interaction between the effects of exposures. we discuss interaction on both additive and multiplicative scales using risks, and we discuss their relation to statistical models (e.g. linear, log-linear, and logistic models). we discuss and evaluate arguments that have been made for using additive or multiplicative scales to assess interaction. we further discuss approaches to presenting interaction analyses, different mechanistic forms of interaction, when interaction is robust to unmeasured confounding, interaction for continuous outcomes, qualitative or “crossover” interactions, methods for attributing effects to interactions, case-only estimators of interaction, and power and sample size calculations for additive and multiplicative interaction.
@result toward eliminating catheter-associated urinary tract infections in an academic health center. background and objectives: it is common practice to catheterize the bladder in the presence of epidural analgesia and to leave the bladder catheter in situ to avoid postoperative urinary retention. however, bladder catheterization carries the risk for urinary tract infection (uti). the objective of this randomized control trial was to assess whether the incidence of uti will differ among patients receiving standard care and patients who have the bladder catheterization discontinued on the morning after surgery with the epidural still functioning. methods: patients at low risk for postoperative urinary retention, scheduled for thoracic and abdominal surgery and receiving continuous thoracic epidural analgesia, were randomized on the morning after surgery to 2 groups: in the early removal group (n = 105), the bladder catheter was removed on the same morning after surgery, whereas in the standard group (sg) (n = 110), the bladder catheter was removed when epidural analgesia was discontinued (3-5 days). urinary bladder volume was assessed by ultrasound. primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of uti and rate of recatheterization. results: two hundred fifteen patients were randomized. there were 17 uti cases in total, with 15 (14%) in the sg and 2 (2%) in the early removal group (p = 0.004). the incidence of recatheterizations was not different between the 2 groups (p = 0.09) and did not correlate with the site of epidural insertion. when matched for the types of surgery, the duration of hospital stay was longer in the patients who contracted uti (p = 0.004). there were more patients older than 65 years in the sg. conclusions: leaving the bladder catheter as long as the epidural analgesia is maintained results in a higher incidence of uti and prolonged hospital stay. removal of the bladder catheter on the morning after surgery does not lead to higher rate of catheterizations.
@result mental health problems among conflict-affected adults in grozny, chechnya: a qualitative study historically, organized violence has been a chronic pervasive problem in haiti. we set out to elicit haitians’ views on its effects to guide the development of interventions. in march 2006 we studied a population in the slum area of cap-haitien, haiti’s second largest city, and the nearby towns of milot and limbe. a convenience sample of adults was asked to free list all current problems affecting victims of organized violence. two major categories emerged: psychological problems and financial problems. the psychological problems of “feeling startled and loss of self control,” “sadness/grief,” “continuing to suffer from reliving/reexperiencing past events,” “problems in the head/mental problems,” “deep suffering in the heart,” and “thinking too much” emerged as themes from key-informant interviews. these may correspond to constructs of depression, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric nosology. the development of effective interventions can therefore consider those known to be effective for these problems in other settings. however in selecting interventions, considerations must also include local acceptability, perceived causes of problems, and their social effects.
@background escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
@background effect of household-based drinking water chlorination on diarrhoea among children under five in orissa, india: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial abstract background diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially among young children in low‐income countries. in these settings, many infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are spread through water contaminated with faeces. in remote and low‐income settings, source‐based water quality improvement includes providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes), or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). point‐of‐use water quality improvement interventions include boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection, mainly conducted at home. objectives to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve water quality for preventing diarrhoea. search methods we searched the cochrane infectious diseases group specialized register (11 november 2014), central (the cochrane library, 7 november 2014), medline (1966 to 10 november 2014), embase (1974 to 10 november 2014), and lilacs (1982 to 7 november 2014). we also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked references from identified studies through 11 november 2014. selection criteria randomized controlled trials (rcts), quasi‐rcts, and controlled before‐and‐after studies (cba) comparing interventions aimed at improving the microbiological quality of drinking water with no intervention in children and adults. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. we used meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, where appropriate, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. we assessed the quality of evidence using the grade approach. main results forty‐five cluster‐rcts, two quasi‐rcts, and eight cba studies, including over 84,000 participants, met the inclusion criteria. most included studies were conducted in low‐ or middle‐income countries (lmics) (50 studies) with unimproved water sources (30 studies) and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies). the primary outcome in most studies was self‐reported diarrhoea, which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding in over 80% of the included studies. source‐based water quality improvements there is currently insufficient evidence to know if source‐based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (one cluster‐rct, five cba studies, very low quality evidence). we found no studies evaluating reliable piped‐in water supplies delivered to households. point‐of‐use water quality interventions on average, distributing water disinfection products for use at the household level may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (home chlorination products: rr 0.77, 95% ci 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants, low quality evidence; flocculation and disinfection sachets: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.58 to 0.82, four trials, 11,788 participants, moderate quality evidence). however, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect estimates between individual studies. point‐of‐use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (rr 0.48, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.59, 18 trials, 15,582 participants, moderate quality evidence). important reductions in diarrhoea episodes were shown with ceramic filters, biosand systems and lifestraw® filters; (ceramic: rr 0.39, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.53; eight trials, 5763 participants, moderate quality evidence; biosand: rr 0.47, 95% ci 0.39 to 0.57; four trials, 5504 participants, moderate quality evidence; lifestraw®: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants, low quality evidence). plumbed in filters have only been evaluated in high‐income settings (rr 0.81, 95% ci 0.71 to 0.94, three trials, 1056 participants, fixed effects model). in low‐income settings, solar water disinfection (sodis) by distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (rr 0.62, 95% ci 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants, moderate quality evidence). in subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container. in most cases, the reduction in diarrhoea shown in the studies was evident in settings with improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation. authors' conclusions interventions that address the microbial contamination of water at the point‐of‐use may be important interim measures to improve drinking water quality until homes can be reached with safe, reliable, piped‐in water connections. the average estimates of effect for each individual point‐of‐use intervention generally show important effects. comparisons between these estimates do not provide evidence of superiority of one intervention over another, as such comparisons are confounded by the study setting, design, and population. further studies assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. as evidence suggests effectiveness improves with adherence, studies assessing programmatic approaches to optimising coverage and long‐term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations could also help strategies to improve health outcomes. 16 april 2019 update pending studies awaiting assessment the cidg is currently examining a new search conducted in april 2019 for potentially relevant studies. these studies have not yet been incorporated into this cochrane review.
@background luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone induces nuclear factor k b-activation and inhibits apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells we report here the purification and cdna cloning of apaf-1, a novel 130 kd protein from hela cell cytosol that participates in the cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3. the nh2-terminal 85 amino acids of apaf-1 show 21% identity and 53% similarity to the nh2-terminal prodomain of the caenorhabditis elegans caspase, ced-3. this is followed by 320 amino acids that show 22% identity and 48% similarity to ced-4, a protein that is believed to initiate apoptosis in c. elegans. the cooh-terminal region of apaf-1 comprises multiple wd repeats, which are proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions. cytochrome c binds to apaf-1, an event that may trigger the activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.

@background pharmacokinetics of intravenous n-acetylcysteine in men at rest and during exercise the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
@background carotenoids and carotenogenic genes in podospora anserina: engineering of the carotenoid composition extends the life span of the mycelium backgroundthe dung-inhabiting ascomycete fungus podospora anserina is a model used to study various aspects of eukaryotic and fungal biology, such as ageing, prions and sexual development.resultswe present a 10x draft sequence of p. anserina genome, linked to the sequences of a large expressed sequence tag collection. similar to higher eukaryotes, the p. anserina transcription/splicing machinery generates numerous non-conventional transcripts. comparison of the p. anserina genome and orthologous gene set with the one of its close relatives, neurospora crassa, shows that synteny is poorly conserved, the main result of evolution being gene shuffling in the same chromosome. the p. anserina genome contains fewer repeated sequences and has evolved new genes by duplication since its separation from n. crassa, despite the presence of the repeat induced point mutation mechanism that mutates duplicated sequences. we also provide evidence that frequent gene loss took place in the lineages leading to p. anserina and n. crassa. p. anserina contains a large and highly specialized set of genes involved in utilization of natural carbon sources commonly found in its natural biotope. it includes genes potentially involved in lignin degradation and efficient cellulose breakdown.conclusionthe features of the p. anserina genome indicate a highly dynamic evolution since the divergence of p. anserina and n. crassa, leading to the ability of the former to use specific complex carbon sources that match its needs in its natural biotope.
@background an approach to the genetics of nitrogen use efficiency in maize. a full-length cdna clone, pmgdh1, encoding maize nadh-glutamate dehydrogenase (nadh-gdh) was isolated from a maize root cdna library. the identity of the cdna was established by the coincidence of the structure of the purified protein with that inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the cdna. pmgdh1 had a cdna insert of 1,638 bp and the open reading frame encoded 411 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was similar to putative partial sequences of gdhs from higher plants and to the sequences of gdhs from organisms as diverse as mammals and bacteria. the nh2-terminal sequence deduced from the open reading frame had a typical structure that is associated with the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. the cdna hybridized to an rna of about 1.6 kb. this transcript was more abundant in roots than in leaves and was localized in the bundle sheath cells in leaf tissues. analysis of genomic dna by southern hybridization suggested the existence of gene(s) for another nadh-gdh subunit(s).
@background dose-dependent modulation of myogenesis by hgf: implications for c-met expression and downstream signalling pathways skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells - muscle stem cells resident beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofibre. quiescent satellite cells express the transcription factor pax7 and when activated, coexpress pax7 with myod. most then proliferate, downregulate pax7 and differentiate. by contrast, others maintain pax7 but lose myod and return to a state resembling quiescence. here we show that pax7 is able to drive transcription in quiescent and activated satellite cells, and continues to do so in those cells that subsequently cease proliferation and withdraw from immediate differentiation. we found that constitutive expression of pax7 in satellite-cell-derived myoblasts did not affect myod expression or proliferation. although maintained expression of pax7 delayed the onset of myogenin expression it did not prevent, and was compatible with, myogenic differentiation. constitutive pax7 expression in a pax7-null c2c12 subclone increased the proportion of cells expressing myod, showing that pax7 can act genetically upstream of myod. however these pax7-null cells were unable to differentiate into normal myotubes in the presence of pax7. therefore pax7 may be involved in maintaining proliferation and preventing precocious differentiation, but does not promote quiescence.
@background verifying synchronization for atomicity violation fixing fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.

@method speaker identification using empirical mode decomposition-based voice activity detection algorithm under realistic conditions • speech conveys several levels of information. on a primary level, speech conveys the words or message being spoken, but on a secondary level, speech also reveals information about the speaker. the speech systems technology group at lincoln laboratory has developed and experimented with approaches for automatically recognizing the words being spoken, the language being spoken, and the topic of a conversation. in this article we present an overview of our research efforts in a fourth area-automatic speaker recognition. we base our approach on a statistical speaker-modeling technique that represents the underlying characteristic sounds of a person's voice. using these models, we build speaker recognizers that are computationally inexpensive and capable of recognizing a speaker regardless ofwhat is being said. performance of the systems is evaluated for a wide range of speech quality; from clean speech to telephone speech, by using several standard speech corpora.
@background cardiac interstitial bradykinin release during ischemia is enhanced by ischemic preconditioning. ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which exposure of the heart to a brief period of ischemia causes it to quickly adapt itself to become resistant to infarction from a subsequent ischemic insult. the mechanism is not fully understood but, at least in the rabbit, it is known to be triggered by occupation of adenosine receptors, opioid receptors, bradykinin receptors and the generation of free radicals during the preconditioning ischemia. all of these are thought to converge on and activate protein kinase c (pkc), which in turn activates a tyrosine kinase. this kinase cascade eventually terminates on some unknown effector, possibly a potassium channel or a cytoskeletal protein, which makes the cells resistant to infarction. if this process can be understood, it should be possible to devise a method for conferring this protection to patients with acute myocardial infarction.
@background maternal enodls are required for pollen tube reception in arabidopsis enod40 is one of the genes associated with legume nodule development and has a putative role in general plant organogenesis. we have isolated a small enod40 gene family from white clover (trifolium repens), with three genes designated trenod40-1, trenod40-2, and trenod40-3, all containing the conserved enod40 regions i and ii. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 share over 90% homology in the transcribed regions and high levels of similarity in their upstream regulatory sequences. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 are similar to the enod40 genes of legumes forming indeterminate nodules (group ii) and are predominantly expressed in nodules. trenod40-3 shares only 32.8% identity with trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 within the transcribed region. trenod40-3 is similar to the enod40 genes of legumes with determinate nodules (group i) and is not predominantly expressed in nodules. to our knowledge, this is the first report of both group iand group ii-type enod40 genes being expressed in a single legume species. in situ hybridization studies revealed that trenod40 genes were highly expressed in non-symbiotic tissues, particularly in stolon nodes during nodal root and lateral shoot development. high levels of trenod40 transcripts were also present in the vascular bundles of mature plant organs, mainly at sites of intensive lateral transport, suggesting a role in vascular tissue function. the expression pattern of trenod40 genes was analyzed further using trenod40 promoter-gus fusions in transgenic white clover and tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), indicating that white clover and tobacco share the regulatory mechanisms for trenod40-1/2 promoters and some aspects of trenod40-3 regulation.
@method a "natural experiment" in childrearing ecologies and adolescents' attachment and separation representations. this meta-analysis on 33 studies, including more than 2,000 adult attachment interview (aai) classifications, presents distributions of aai classifications in samples of nonclinical fathers and mothers, in adolescents, in samples from different cultures, and in clinical groups. fathers, adolescents, and participants from different countries show about the same distribution of aai classifications as nonclinical mothers do. the distribution of nonclinical mothers is as follows: 24% dismissing, 58% autonomous, and 18% preoccupied mothers. about 19% of the nonclinical mothers are unresolved with respect to loss or trauma of other kinds. mothers from low socioeconomic status show more often dismissing attachment representations and unresolved loss or trauma. autonomous women and autonomous men are more often married to each other than can be expected by chance, and the same goes for unresolved men and women. clinical participants show highly deviating distributions of aai classifications, with a strong overrepresentation of insecure attachment representations, but systematic relations between clinical diagnosis and type of insecurity are absent.
@background protein kinase c ( pkc )-a activation inhibits pkc-z and mediates the action of ped / pea-15 on glucose transport in the l 6 skeletal muscle cells we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
@method knowledge integration for improving performance in lvcsr most statistical speech recognition systems make use of segment-level features, derived mainly from spectral envelope characteristics of the signal, but ignore supra-segmental cues that carry additional information likely to be useful for speech recognition. these cues, which constitute the prosody of the utterance and occur at the syllable, word and utterance level, are closely related to the lexical and syntactic organization of the utterance. in this paper, we explore the use of acoustic and lexical correlates of a subset of these cues in order to improve recognition performance on a read-speech corpus, using word error rate (wer) as the metric. using the features and methods described in this paper, we were able to obtain a relative wer improvement of 1.3% over a baseline asr system on the boston university radio news corpus.
@background pelvic floor disorders among women in dabat district, northwest ethiopia: a pilot study context pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect many women. no national prevalence estimates derived from the same population-based sample exists for multiple pelvic floor disorders in women in the united states.   objective to provide national prevalence estimates of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders in us women.   design, setting, and participants a cross-sectional analysis of 1961 nonpregnant women (>or=20 years) who participated in the 2005-2006 national health and nutrition examination survey, a nationally representative survey of the us noninstitutionalized population. women were interviewed in their homes and then underwent standardized physical examinations in a mobile examination center. urinary incontinence (score of >or=3 on a validated incontinence severity index, constituting moderate to severe leakage), fecal incontinence (at least monthly leakage of solid, liquid, or mucous stool), and pelvic organ prolapse (seeing/feeling a bulge in or outside the vagina) symptoms were assessed.   main outcome measures weighted prevalence estimates of urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.   results the weighted prevalence of at least 1 pelvic floor disorder was 23.7% (95% confidence interval [ci], 21.2%-26.2%), with 15.7% of women (95% ci, 13.2%-18.2%) experiencing urinary incontinence, 9.0% of women (95% ci, 7.3%-10.7%) experiencing fecal incontinence, and 2.9% of women (95% ci, 2.1%-3.7%) experiencing pelvic organ prolapse. the proportion of women reporting at least 1 disorder increased incrementally with age, ranging from 9.7% (95% ci, 7.8%-11.7%) in women between ages 20 and 39 years to 49.7% (95% ci, 40.3%-59.1%) in those aged 80 years or older (p < .001), and parity (12.8% [95% ci, 9.0%-16.6%], 18.4% [95% ci, 12.9%-23.9%], 24.6% [95% ci, 19.5%-29.8%], and 32.4% [95% ci, 27.8%-37.1%] for 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more deliveries, respectively; p < .001). overweight and obese women were more likely to report at least 1 pelvic floor disorder than normal weight women (26.3% [95% ci, 21.7%-30.9%], 30.4% [95% ci, 25.8%-35.0%], and 15.1% [95% ci, 11.6%-18.7%], respectively; p < .001). we detected no differences in prevalence by racial/ethnic group.   conclusion pelvic floor disorders affect a substantial proportion of women and increase with age.
@background primary murine microglia are resistant to nitric oxide inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) and nitric oxide synthase (nos) is involved in the immunomodulatory roles of ifn-gamma and evidence suggests that these pathways are functionally cross-regulated. we report here that nitric oxide (no) negatively modulates the expression of ido activity in ifn-gamma-primed macrophages, but not in microglial cells from mouse. in mt2 macrophages, the induction of ido activity by ifn-gamma was further increased by the presence of nos inhibitors, whereas culturing of ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells with no generators produced a marked reduction of ido activity expression. conversely, neither nos inhibitors nor exogenous no affected the induction of the enzyme activity in n11 microglial cells after ifn-gamma activation. lps and picolinic acid, two costimulatory agents that up-regulate inducible nos in activated cells, regulated ido induction differently in the two cell lines. lps and picolinic acid caused a significant decrease of ido activity in ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells. this effect, however, did not appear to be mediated by the ability of lps and picolinic acid to stimulate no production. in n11 cells, lps further stimulated the enzyme activity and picolinic acid had no effect. northern blot analysis revealed that, in mt2 macrophages, nos inhibitors increased the levels of ido mrna, while a reduction was observed with picolinic acid. no changes in ido mrna levels were detected in n11 cells. consistent with the functional heterogeneity of phagocytes, the reported results indicate the existence of marked differences in the regulation of ido expression between murine macrophages and microglial cells.
@method stable simulation of fluid flow with high-reynolds number using ehrenfests’ steps the entropy maximum approach to constructing equilibria in lattice kinetic equations is revisited. for a suitable entropy function, we derive explicitly the hydrodynamic local equilibrium, prove the $h$ theorem for lattice bhatnagar-gross-krook models, and develop a systematic method to account for additional constraints.
@background gaba-immunohistological observations, at the electron-microscopical level, of the neurons of isthmic nuclei in chicken, gallus domesticus the chick brain is a useful model system for studying the ontogeny and phylogeny of neural circuitry, especially that of the visual system. in this study the distribution of cells and processes showing gaba‐like immunoreactivity (gaba+) in the diencephalon and mesencephalon of the posthatch chick was determined immunohistochemically with a polyclonal antibody to gaba and compared with the results of similar studies in mammals. most of the small gaba+ cells were found in the chick visual centers such as the nucleus lateralis anterior, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate, optic tract, dorsolateralis anterior pars lateralis, lentiformis mesencephali, ectomammillary nucleus, area pretectalis, and the optic tectum. large gaba+ cells were found in the following nuclei: reticularis superior, posteroventralis thalami, subpretectalis, isthmi pars magnocellularis, interstitiopretectosubpretectalis, mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis. these large cell‐containing nuclei receive projections from visual or auditory centers. gaba+ axons were found throughout the diencephalon and mesencephalon but were especially prominent in the ansa lenticularis, fasciculus medialis longitudinalis, and optic tract. the distribution of gaba+ cells in the chick is more widespread than in rodents and exhibits an increased association with the visual centers suggesting a correlation with the specialized visual requirements of the bird.
@background a diffusion-reaction model of signal transduction by mapk cascades cells respond to a plethora of signals using a limited set of intracellular signal transduction components. surprisingly, pathways that transduce distinct signals can share protein components, yet avoid erroneous cross-talk. a highly tractable model system in which to study this paradox is the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which harbors three mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction cascades that share multiple signaling components. in this review we first describe potential mechanisms by which specificity could be achieved by signaling pathways that share components. second, we summarize key features and components of the yeast mapk pathways that control the mating pheromone response, filamentous growth, and the response to high osmolarity. finally, we review biochemical analyses in yeast of mutations that cause cross-talk between these three mapk pathways and their implications for the mechanistic bases for signaling specificity. although much remains to be learned, current data indicate that scaffolding and cross pathway inhibition play key roles in the maintenance of fidelity.

@background inferring past demographic changes from contemporary genetic data: a simulation‐based evaluation of the abc methods implemented in diyabc the analysis of genetic variation to estimate demographic and historical parameters and to quantitatively compare alternative scenarios recently gained a powerful and flexible approach: the approximate bayesian computation (abc). the likelihood functions does not need to be theoretically specified, but posterior distributions can be approximated by simulation even assuming very complex population models including both natural and human‐induced processes. prior information can be easily incorporated and the quality of the results can be analysed with rather limited additional effort. abc is not a statistical analysis per se, but rather a statistical framework and any specific application is a sort of hybrid between a simulation and a data‐analysis study. complete software packages performing the necessary steps under a set of models and for specific genetic markers are already available, but the flexibility of the method is better exploited combining different programs. many questions relevant in ecology can be addressed using abc, but adequate amount of time should be dedicated to decide among alternative options and to evaluate the results. in this paper we will describe and critically comment on the different steps of an abc analysis, analyse some of the published applications of abc and provide user guidelines.
@background baseline chronic kidney disease and ischemic method of partial nephrectomy are important factors for the short- and long-term deterioration in renal function for renal cell carcinoma staged t1-t2: a retrospective single center study the activity of the malate-aspartate shuttle for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) by mitochondria was assessed in six lines of rodent ascites tumor cells (two strains of ehrlich ascites carcinoma, krebs ii carcinoma, novikoff hepatoma, as-30d hepatoma, and l1210 mouse leukemia). all the tumor cells examined showed mitochondrial reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh, as evidenced by the accumulation of pyruvate when the cells were incubated aerobically with l-lactate. reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh thus generated was completely inhibited by the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. the involvement of the respiratory chain in the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh was demonstrated by the action of cyanide, rotenone, and antimycin a, which strongly inhibited the formation of pyruvate from added l-lactate. compounds that inhibit the carrier-mediated entry of malate into mitochondria, such as butylmalonate, benzenetricarboxylate, and iodobenzylmalonate, also inhibited the accumulation of pyruvate from added l-lactate by the tumor cells. the maximal rate of the malate-aspartate shuttle was established by addtion of arsenite to inhibit the mitochondrial oxidation of the pyruvate formed from added lactate. the capacity of the various tumor lines for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh via the malate-aspartate shuttle approaches 20% of the total respiratory rate of the cells and thus appears to be sufficient to account for the mitochondrial reoxidation of that fraction of glycolytic nadh not reoxidized by pyruvate and lactate dehydrognenase in the cytoplasm.
@background custom-fit minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty: effect on blood loss and early clinical outcomes purposecorrect alignment of the leg and positioning of the components are important factors in good long-term outcome of total knee arthroplasty (tka). computer-assisted navigation systems were introduced to improve component alignment accuracies. the three main hypotheses of this study were that the navigated compared to jig-based patient will show the following: (1) no difference in clinical outcomes. (2) better alignment in the frontal and sagittal plane. (3) better rotational positioning of components.methodsthe authors evaluated 100 patients who had minimally invasive tka using either an image-free computer-assisted navigation system (n = 50) or a jig-based technique (n = 50). six months postoperatively, clinical and radiological evaluations were performed using full-length standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs and ct scans of the knee.resultsknee society knee score, function score, and range of motion were comparable in the two groups after surgery. the percentage of patients with a frontal tibiofemoral angle within ±3° of the ideal was significantly higher in the navigated group than in the jig-based group (94% vs. 78%, respectively; p = 0.041). no significant differences were found between groups in terms of the frontal and sagittal planes as well as rotational alignment of the femoral or tibial components.conclusioncomputer-assisted tka gives a better correction of alignment of the leg compared with jig-based tka when combined with a minimally invasive surgical approach.
@result polychaete richness and abundance enhanced in anthropogenically modified estuaries despite high concentrations of toxic contaminants we examine macrofaunal and physico-chemical responses to organic enrichment beneath salmon farms in contrasting flow environments, and reveal pronounced flow-related differences in the magnitude and spatial extent of effects. total macrofaunal abundances at high flow sites were nearly an order of magnitude greater than at comparable low flow sites, representing a significant benthic biomass. these very high abundances occurred in conjunction with moderate-to-high species richness, and were evident in the absence of appreciable organic matter accumulation. biological responses to increasing sulfide were variable; however a significant biological threshold was evident at 1500 μm. macrofaunal responses at high flow sites differed substantially from the pearson-rosenberg model. the atypical ecological conditions were attributed to (i) limited accumulation of fine sediments, (ii) maintenance of aerobic conditions in near-surface sediments, and (iii) an abundant food supply. thus, enhanced resilience to organic waste at well-flushed sites appears related to both biological and physical processes.
@background standstill frequency response test for obtaining parameters of six phase double delta salient-pole synchronous machine on example of claw-pole alternator this paper presents the steps of the approach to identify the linear parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine at standstill and by frequency response tests data (ssfr). it is currently established and demonstrated that stability parameters for synchronous machines can be obtained by performing frequency response tests with the machine at standstill. the objective of this study is to use several input-output signals, according to a setup test recommended by the standard ieee std 115, to identify the model structure and parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine from frequency response tests data. this procedure consists of defining and conducting the frequency response tests, identifying the model structure, estimating the corresponding parameters, and making valid the resulting model. we estimate the parameters of operational impedances, or in other terms, the reactances and the time constants. the results are presented from tests on the synchronous machine of 1.5 kva/380v/1500 rpm. k e y w o r d s: synchronous machine, parameter estimation, modeling, standstill tests, frequency response
@background the mechanoreflex and hemodynamic response to passive leg movement in heart failure. we investigated the role of somatosensory feedback on cardioventilatory responses to rhythmic exercise in five men. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects performed the same leg cycling exercise (50/100/150/325 ± 19 w, 3 min each) under placebo conditions (interspinous saline, l(3)-l(4)) and with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl impairing central projection of spinal opioid receptor-sensitive muscle afferents. quadriceps strength was similar before and after fentanyl administration. to evaluate whether a cephalad migration of fentanyl affected cardioventilatory control centers in the brain stem, we compared resting ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (hcvr) and cardioventilatory responses to arm vs. leg cycling exercise after each injection. similar hcvr and minor effects of fentanyl on cardioventilatory responses to arm exercise excluded direct medullary effects of fentanyl. central command during leg exercise was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram. no differences between conditions were found in resting heart rate (hr), ventilation [minute ventilation (ve)], or mean arterial pressure (map). quadriceps electromyogram, o(2) consumption (vo(2)), and plasma lactate were similar in both conditions at the four steady-state workloads. compared with placebo, a substantial hypoventilation during fentanyl exercise was indicated by the 8-17% reduction in ve/co(2) production (vco(2)) secondary to a reduced breathing frequency, leading to average increases of 4-7 torr in end-tidal pco(2) (p < 0.001) and a reduced hemoglobin saturation (-3 ± 1%; p < 0.05) at the heaviest workload (∼90% maximal vo(2)) with fentanyl. hr was reduced 2-8%, map 8-13%, and ratings of perceived exertion by 13% during fentanyl vs. placebo exercise (p < 0.05). these findings demonstrate the essential contribution of muscle afferent feedback to the ventilatory, cardiovascular, and perceptual responses to rhythmic exercise in humans, even in the presence of unaltered contributions from other major inputs to cardioventilatory control.
@background parental occupational exposure to pesticides and childhood brain cancer. pesticides are used worldwide in agriculture, industry, public health and for domestic applications: as a consequence, a great part of the population may be exposed to these compounds. in spite of this extensive use, knowledge on the health risks associated with prolonged exposure is rather poor, and major uncertainties still exist. epidemiological observations in man have so far produced little conclusive information, mainly because of weaknesses in exposure assessment. therefore, information on the type and levels of exposure is fundamental in order to better understand and characterize risk to human health. exposure assessment can be carried out via measurement of environmental concentrations, as well as via determination of the chemical or its metabolites in body tissues (biological monitoring). besides indices of internal dose, biological monitoring also includes measurements of early effects attributable to interaction between the chemical agent and the human body. biological monitoring has the advantage, over environmental monitoring, of determining the dose actually absorbed via any possible route: differences in absorption can be taken into account. whether they are due to biological variability or to use of protective equipment. when, in some cases, a combination of occupational and non-occupational exposure occurs, this also can be taken into consideration by biological monitoring. few reference documents have been published on biological monitoring of pesticides. for this reason, the office of occupational health of the world health organization gave icps a mandate to prepare a monograph specifically addressed to reviewing methods for biological monitoring of pesticide exposure. this review is based on more than 300 studies published over the period 1980-1999. for the most representative chemical classes, the available biological exposure indices are reported. both indices of internal dose and. when available, of early effects are discussed. the reported tests were used to monitor exposure of pesticide applicators in agriculture and public health, manufacturing and formulating workers. subjects poisoned after accidental exposure or attempted suicide, volunteers involved in pharmacokinetic studies, as well as sub-groups of the general population exposed to environmentally persistent pesticides. single chapters deal with organophosphorus insecticides, carbamate pesticides, dithiocarbamates, phenoxyacids, quaternary ammonium compounds. coumarin rodenticides, synthetic pyrethroids, organochlorine pesticides, chlorotriazines, and pentachlorophenol.
@background vaccinations and malaria prophylaxis for long-term travellers travelling from greece: a prospective, questionnaire-based analysis. an increasing number of travelers travel to hepatitis b-endemic countries. in travel medicine, vaccinations should be advised according to risks. the actual incidence of hepatitis b infection in short-term tourists is very low and probably not higher than it is for people who do not travel. there is evidence that long-term travelers and immigrants originating from hepatitis b-endemic countries are at higher risk of infection and they should always be offered vaccination. for all other travelers living in countries with universal hepatitis b vaccination, vaccination could be advised as a catch-up strategy.
@background screening for depression in adults: a summary of the evidence for the u.s. preventive services task force background high utilizers of nonpsychiatric health care services have disproportionally high rates of undiagnosed or undertreated depression.   objective to determine the impact of offering a systematic primary care-based depression treatment program to depressed "high utilizers" not in active treatment.   design randomized clinical trial.   setting one hundred sixty-three primary care practices in 3 health maintenance organizations located in different geographic regions of the united states.   patients a group of 1465 health maintenance organization members were identified as depressed high utilizers using a 2-stage telephone screening process. eligibility criteria were met by 410 patients and 407 agreed to enroll: 218 in the depression management program (dmp) practices and 189 in the usual care (uc) group.   intervention the dmp included patient education materials, physician education programs, telephone-based treatment coordination, and antidepressant pharmacotherapy initiated and managed by patients' primary care physicians.   main outcome measures depression severity was measured using the hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d) and functional status using the medical outcomes study 20-item short form (sf-20) subscales. outpatient visit and hospitalization rates were measured using the health plan's encounter data.   results based on an intent-to-treat analysis, at least 3 antidepressant prescriptions were filled in the first 6 months by 151 (69.3%) of 218 of dmp patients vs 35 (18.5%) of 189 in uc (p < .001). improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001). at 12 months, dmp intervention patients were more improved than uc patients on the mental health, social functioning, and general health perceptions scales of the sf-20 (p < .05 for all).   conclusion in depressed high utilizers not already in active treatment, a systematic primary care-based treatment program can substantially increase adequate antidepressant treatment, decrease depression severity, and improve general health status compared with usual care.
@method fatty acid translocase/cd36 mediates the uptake of palmitate by type ii pneumocytes. nucleic acid probes are an important tool in molecular diagnosis. to facilitate the detection of hybridized probes, they are labeled with a reporter molecule, which is usually a radioisotope. for diagnostic techniques carried out in a clinical laboratory, radioisotopes are hazardous and, thus, recently there is a move to use nonisotopic labels, such as biotin and digoxigenin. nonisotopic probes also have the advantage of much better stability over time compared with isotopic probes that have limited half-lives.

@result activation of risk and safe pathways is not involved in the effects of cx43 deficiency on tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and preconditioning protection activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
@background a language modeling approach for the recommendation of tourism-related services we describe our efforts in trec 2012 contextual suggestion track. the task is to provide sug- gestions to users based on their personal interests as well as their contexts. to tackle the problem, we propose to rank candidate suggestions based on their similarity to the personal profile and that to the contexts (i.e., geographic and temporal information). the ranking function is computed based on the similarity between a suggestion and the places that the user like and the dis-similarity between the suggestion and the places disliked by the user. the similarities are computed based on the either the category or description of the suggestions.
@background an aqueous extract of marine microalgae exhibits antimetastatic activity through preferential killing of suspended cancer cells and anticolony forming activity angiogenesis is required for invasive tumor growth and metastasis and constitutes an important point in the control of cancer progression. its inhibition may be a valuable new approach to cancer therapy. avascular tumors are severely restricted in their growth potential because of the lack of a blood supply. for tumors to develop in size and metastatic potential they must make an "angiogenic switch" through perturbing the local balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. frequently, tumors overexpress proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, allowing them to make this angiogenic switch. two strategies used in the development of antiangiogenic agents involve the inhibition of proangiogenic factors (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibodies) as well as therapy with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as endostatin and angiostatin. therapy with endogenous angiogenic inhibitors such as endostatin and angiostatin may reverse the angiogenic switch preventing growth of tumor vasculature. preclinical studies have shown that endostatin effectively inhibits tumor growth and shrinks existing tumor blood vessels. phase 1 clinical trials of endostatin and angiostatin are ongoing, and preliminary results show minimal toxicities.
@method increased chemosensitivity and elevated reactive oxygen species are mediated by glutathione reduction in glutamine deprived neuroblastoma cells the microtiter plate technique reported by baker and colleagues for the glutathione reductase-dtnb recycling assay of total glutathione (gsx) and glutathione disulfide (gssg) has been modified according to anderson's recommendations, in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of this miniaturized method for the measurement of glutathione status in cultured/isolated cells. dilute hcl (10 mmol/l) has been used to lyse cells, before protein removal by centrifugation in the presence of 1.3% sulfosalicylic acid. the final dtnb, gssg-reductase and nadph concentrations in the reaction mixture have been increased to 0.7 mmol/l, 1.2 iu/ml and 0.24 mmol/l, respectively. the procedure specificity has been tested by spiking and dilution assays, showing that about 90% of the expected gsx amounts could actually be recovered, while no changes of gssg concentrations were caused in the cells. accuracy has been assessed by analysis of within-series precision as well as of intra- and interassay reproducibility, showing coefficient variation of <10%. glutathione changes measured either in control rat hepatocytes or in primary cultures treated with paracetamol or menadione were in good agreement with well-known literature data. these data suggest that the experimental conditions reported in this paper are suitable for the analysis of total glutathione and glutathione disulfide concentrations in cultured/isolated cells.
@background amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine up‐regulates telomerase activity in panc‐1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells glycation has been implicated in the endothelial dysfunction that contributes to both diabetes‐ and aging‐associated vascular complications. the aim of the present study was to determine whether amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine (amadori‐pe), a lipid‐linked glycation compound that is formed at an increased rate in hyperglycemic states, affected proliferation, migration and tube formation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). amadori‐pe at a low concentration of less than 5 μm significantly enhanced these three factors involved in angiogenesis. furthermore, stimulation of huvec with amadori‐pe resulted in secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp‐2), a pivotal enzyme in the initial step of angiogenesis. our results demonstrated for the first time that amadori‐pe may be an important compound that promotes vascular disease as a result of its angiogenic activity on endothelial cells. we also demonstrated that mmp‐2 is a primary mediator of amadori‐pe‐driven angiogenesis.
@background activation of innate immunity to reduce lung metastases in breast cancer bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) stimulate mouse peritoneal macrophages to kill tumor cells in vitro. lysis is confined to tumor cells where it is nonspecific; both allogeneic and syngeneic cells being susceptible. stimulation by lps appears to be due to direct interaction between lps and macrophages and does not involve participation by lymphocytes. after exposure to lps, a latent period must elapse before macrophages can lyse tumor cells. the cytolytic mechanism requires contact between target cells and viable effector cells which maintain their lytic capacity for a sustained period and can kill on repeated occasions. the generation of a macrophage cytolytic effect by lps is critically dependent upon the absolute number of macrophages which must be sufficient to produce confluent monolayers. these findings indicate that lps stimulation of macrophages in vitro represents a valuable model system for the study of the mechanisms of macrophage stimulation and of the mediation of tumor cell death.
@method scheduling workflows with budget workflow management is emerging as an important service in grid computing. a simple model that can be used for the representation of certain workflows is a directed acyclic graph. although many heuristics have been proposed to schedule such graphs on heterogeneous environments, most of them assume accurate prediction of computation and communication costs. this limits their direct applicability to a dynamically changing environment, such as the grid. in this environment, an initial schedule may be built based on estimates, but run-time rescheduling may be needed to improve application performance. this paper presents a low-cost rescheduling policy, which considers rescheduling at a few, carefully selected points during the execution. this policy achieves performance results, which are comparable with those achieved by a policy that dynamically attempts to reschedule before the execution of every task.
@background the kunitz-like modulatory protein haemangin is vital for hard tick blood-feeding success in recent years, the basement membrane (bm) — a specialized form of extracellular matrix (ecm) — has been recognized as an important regulator of cell behaviour, rather than just a structural feature of tissues. the bm mediates tissue compartmentalization and sends signals to epithelial cells about the external microenvironment. the bm is also an important structural and functional component of blood vessels, constituting an extracellular microenvironment sensor for endothelial cells and pericytes. vascular bm components have recently been found to be involved in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis, making them attractive candidate targets for potential cancer therapies.
@background cpla2-interacting protein, plip, causes apoptosis and decreases g1 phase in mesangial cells. abstract the group iv cytosolic phospholipase a2(cpla2) has been localized to the nucleus (m. r. sierra-honigmann, j. r. bradley, and j. s. pober, lab. investig. 74:684–695, 1996) and is known to translocate from the cytosolic compartment to the nuclear membrane (s. glover, m. s. de carvalho, t. bayburt, m. jonas, e. chi, c. c. leslie, and m. h. gelb, j. biol. chem. 270:15359–15367, 1995; a. r. schievella, m. k. regier, w. l. smith, and l. l. lin, j. biol. chem. 270:30749–30754, 1995). we hypothesized that nuclear proteins interact with cpla2 and participate in the functional effects of this translocation. we have identified a nuclear protein, cpla2-interacting protein (plip), a splice variant of human tip60, which interacts with the amino terminal region of cpla2. like tip60, plip cdna includes the myst domain containing a c2hc zinc finger and well-conserved similarities to acetyltransferases. both plip and tip60 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize with cpla2 within the nuclei of transfected cos cells. a polyclonal antibody raised to plip recognizes both plip and tip60. endogenous tip60 and/or plip in rat mesangial cells is localized to the nucleus in response to serum deprivation. nuclear localization coincides temporally with apoptosis. plip expression, mediated by adenoviral gene transfer, potentiates serum deprivation-induced prostaglandin e2 (pge2) production and apoptosis in mouse mesangial cells from cpla2 +/+ mice but not in mesangial cells derived from cpla2 −/− mice. thus plip, a splice variant of tip60, interacts with cpla2 and potentiates cpla2-mediated pge2 production and apoptosis.
@background construction of a taste-blind medaka fish and quantitative assay of its preference–aversion behavior in mammals, taste perception is a major mode of sensory input. we have identified a novel family of 40-80 human and rodent g protein-coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. these candidate taste receptors (t2rs) are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. notably, a single taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of t2rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. t2rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the g protein alpha subunit gustducin, implying that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. in the accompanying paper, we demonstrate that t2rs couple to gustducin in vitro, and respond to bitter tastants in a functional expression assay.
@method changes in clinical trials methodology over time recently, paradigm shift from expert opinion towards evidence-based medicine has occurred encouraging physicians to base their treatment decisions on the best available research evidence. in the hierarchy of evidence randomized clinical trials (level 1 evidence) are considered of the highest quality (least biased) while non-randomized studies represent lower levels (levels 2–4). several pitfalls in the design and conduct of clinical research include: lack of randomization, lack of concealment, lack of blinding, and errors in hypothesis testing (type i and ii errors). a basic understanding of these principles of research will empower both investigators and readers when applying the results of research to clinical practice.
@method structural, biochemical, and cell biological characterization of rab7 mutants that cause peripheral neuropathy prenylated rab gtpases occur in the cytosol in their gdp‐bound conformations bound to a cytosolic protein termed gdp‐dissociation inhibitor (gdi). rab–gdi complexes represent a pool of active, recycling rab proteins that can deliver rabs to specific and distinct membrane‐bound compartments. rab delivery to cellular membranes involves release of gdi, and the membrane‐associated rab protein then exchanges its bound gdp for gtp. we report here the identification of a novel, membrane‐associated protein factor that can release prenylated rab proteins from gdi. this gdi‐displacement factor (gdf) is not a guanine nucleotide exchange factor because it did not influence the intrinsic rates of nucleotide exchange by rabs 5, 7 or 9. rather, gdf caused the release of each of these endosomal rabs from gdi, permitting them to exchange nucleotide at their intrinsic rates. gdf displayed the greatest catalytic rate enhancement on rab9–gdi complexes. however, catalytic rate enhancement paralleled the potency of gdi in blocking nucleotide exchange: gdi was shown to be most potent in blocking nucleotide exchange by rab9. the failure of gdf to act on rab1–gdi complexes suggests that it may be specific for endosomal rab proteins. this novel, membrane‐associated activity may be part of the machinery used to localize rabs to their correct intracellular compartments.
@background sor guidelines for concomitant chemoradiotherapy for patients with uterine cervical cancers: evidence update bulletin 2004. purpose to report mature results of a randomized trial that compared extended-field radiotherapy (efrt) versus pelvic radiotherapy with concomitant fluorouracil and cisplatin (ctrt) in women with locoregionally advanced carcinomas of the uterine cervix.   patients and methods four hundred three women with cervical cancer were randomly assigned to receive either efrt or ctrt. patients were eligible if they had stage iib to iva disease, stage ib to iia disease with a tumor diameter > or = 5 cm, or positive pelvic lymph nodes. patients were stratified by stage and by method of lymph node evaluation.   results the median follow-up time for 228 surviving patients was 6.6 years. the overall survival rate for patients treated with ctrt was significantly greater than that for patients treated with efrt (67% v 41% at 8 years; p <.0001). there was an overall reduction in the risk of disease recurrence of 51% (95% ci, 36% to 66%) for patients who received ctrt. patients with stage ib to iib disease who received ctrt had better overall and disease-free survival than those treated with efrt (p <.0001); 116 patients with stage iii to iva disease had better disease-free survival (p =.05) and a trend toward better overall survival (p =.07) if they were randomly assigned to ctrt. the rate of serious late complications of treatment was similar for the two treatment arms.   conclusion mature analysis confirms that the addition of fluorouracil and cisplatin to radiotherapy significantly improved the survival rate of women with locally advanced cervical cancer without increasing the rate of late treatment-related side effects.
@background dynamics of photogenerated holes in surface modified α-fe2o3 photoanodes for solar water splitting transient absorption spectroscopy on the μs-s time scale is used to monitor the yield and decay dynamics of photogenerated holes in nanocrystalline hematite photoanodes. in the absence of a positive applied bias, these holes are observed to undergo rapid electron-hole recombination. the application of a positive bias results in the generation of long-lived (3 ± 1 s lifetime) photoholes.
@method chapter 9 action recognition in realistic sports videos deformable part models have achieved impressive performance for object detection, even on difficult image datasets. this paper explores the generalization of deformable part models from 2d images to 3d spatiotemporal volumes to better study their effectiveness for action detection in video. actions are treated as spatiotemporal patterns and a deformable part model is generated for each action from a collection of examples. for each action model, the most discriminative 3d sub volumes are automatically selected as parts and the spatiotemporal relations between their locations are learned. by focusing on the most distinctive parts of each action, our models adapt to intra-class variation and show robustness to clutter. extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the strength of spatiotemporal dpms for classifying and localizing actions.
@method genetic screen of african americans with fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy fuchs corneal dystrophy (fcd) is a degenerative genetic disorder of the corneal endothelium that represents one of the most common causes of corneal transplantation in the united states. despite its high prevalence (4% over the age of 40), the underlying genetic basis of fcd is largely unknown. here we report missense mutations in tcf8, a transcription factor whose haploinsufficiency causes posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (ppcd), in a cohort of late-onset fcd patients. in contrast to ppcd-causing mutations, all of which are null, fcd-associated mutations encode rare missense changes suggested to cause loss of function by an in vivo complementation assay. importantly, segregation of a recurring p.q840p mutation in a large, multigenerational fcd pedigree showed this allele to be sufficient but not necessary for pathogenesis. execution of a genome-wide scan conditioned for the presence of the 840p allele identified an additional late-onset fcd locus on chromosome 9p, whereas haplotype analysis indicated that the presence of the tcf8 allele and the disease haplotype on 9p leads to a severe fcd manifestation with poor prognosis. our data suggest that ppcd and fcd are allelic variants of the same disease continuum and that genetic interaction between genes that cause corneal dystrophies can modulate the expressivity of the phenotype.
@method deep feature fusion network for answer quality prediction in community question answering we describe semeval–2017 task 3 on community question answering. this year, we reran the four subtasks from semeval-2016: (a) question–comment similarity, (b) question–question similarity, (c) question–external comment similarity, and (d) rerank the correct answers for a new question in arabic, providing all the data from 2015 and 2016 for training, and fresh data for testing. additionally, we added a new subtask e in order to enable experimentation with multi-domain question duplicate detection in a larger-scale scenario, using stackexchange subforums. a total of 23 teams participated in the task, and submitted a total of 85 runs (36 primary and 49 contrastive) for subtasks a–d. unfortunately, no teams participated in subtask e. a variety of approaches and features were used by the participating systems to address the different subtasks. the best systems achieved an official score (map) of 88.43, 47.22, 15.46, and 61.16 in subtasks a, b, c, and d, respectively. these scores are better than the baselines, especially for subtasks a–c.
@method recognizing complex events in videos by learning key static-dynamic evidences this paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. while previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. this makes them difficult and expensive to apply. the goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. taking a support vector machine (svm) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. from a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. the theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. it shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.
@result inhibition of unfolding and aggregation of lens protein human gamma d crystallin by sodium citrate. data are reported for tm, the temperature midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, of ribonuclease a, versus ph (range 2–9) and salt concentration (range 0–1 m) for two salts, na2so4 and nacl. the results show stabilization by sulfate via anion‐specific binding in the concentration range 0–0.1 m and via the hofmeister effect in the concentration range 0.1–1.0 m. the increase in tm caused by anion binding at 0.1 m sulfate is 20° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9, where the net proton charge on the protein is near 0. the 10° increase in tm between 0.1 and 1.0 m na2so4, caused by the hofmeister effect, is independent of ph. a striking property of the nacl results is the absence of any significant stabilization by 0.1 m nacl, which indicates that any debye screening is small. ph‐dependent stabilization is produced by 1 m nacl: the increase in tm between 0 and 1.0 m is 14° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9. the 14° increase at ph 2 may result from anion binding or from both binding and debye screening. taken together, the results for na2so4 and nacl show that native ribonuclease a is stabilized at low ph in the same manner as molten globule forms of cytochrome c and apomyoglobin, which are stabilized at low ph by low concentrations of sulfate but only by high concentrations of chloride.
@background ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract ghrelin, an acylated peptide produced predominantly in the stomach, stimulates feeding and gh secretion via interactions with the gh secretagogue type 1a receptor (ghs-r1a), the functionally active form of the ghs-r. ghrelin molecules exist in the stomach and hypothalamus as two major endogenous forms, a form acylated at serine 3 (ghrelin) and a des-acylated form (des-acyl ghrelin). acylation is indispensable for the binding of ghrelin to the ghs-r1a. ghrelin enhances feeding via the neuronal pathways of neuropeptide y and orexin, which act as orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. we here studied the effect of des-acyl ghrelin on feeding behavior. intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of rat des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice fed ad libitum stimulated feeding during the light phase; neither ip nor icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin to fasting mice suppressed feeding. the icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin induced the expression of fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in orexin-expressing neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area, but not neuropeptide y-expressing neurons of the arcuate nucleus. peripheral administration of des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice did not affect feeding. although icv administration of ghrelin did not induce food intake in ghs-r-deficient mice, it did in orexin-deficient mice. in contrast, icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin stimulated feeding in ghs-r-deficient mice, but not orexin-deficient mice. des-acyl ghrelin increased the intracellular calcium concentrations in isolated orexin neurons. central des-acyl ghrelin may activate orexin-expressing neurons, perhaps functioning in feeding regulation through interactions with a target protein distinct from the ghs-r.
@background attentional and nonattentional forms of sequence learning how is complex sequential material acquired, processed, and represented when there is no intention to learn? two experiments exploring a choice reaction time task are reported. unknown to ss, successive stimuli followed a sequence derived from a "noisy" finite-state grammar. after considerable practice (60,000 exposures) with experiment 1, ss acquired a complex body of procedural knowledge about the sequential structure of the material. experiment 2 was an attempt to identify limits on ss ability to encode the temporal context by using more distant contingencies that spanned irrelevant material. taken together, the results indicate that ss become increasingly sensitive to the temporal context set by previous elements of the sequence, up to 3 elements. responses are also affected by priming effects from recent trials. a connectionist model that incorporates sensitivity to the sequential structure and to priming effects is shown to capture key aspects of both acquisition and processing and to account for the interaction between attention and sequence structure reported by cohen, ivry, and keele (1990).
@background differential expression of enzymes associated with serine/glycine metabolism in different breast cancer subtypes identification of the factors critical to the tumor-initiating cell (tic) state may open new avenues in cancer therapy. here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (gldc) is critical for tics in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). tics from primary nsclc tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor lin28b and gldc, which are both required for tic growth and tumorigenesis. overexpression of gldc and other glycine/serine enzymes, but not catalytically inactive gldc, promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. we found that gldc induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. in the clinic, aberrant activation of gldc correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients, and aberrant gldc expression is observed in multiple cancer types. this link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy.
@method reduced incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in walkers and runners we provide an updated version of the compendium of physical activities, a coding scheme that classifies specific physical activity (pa) by rate of energy expenditure. it was developed to enhance the comparability of results across studies using self-reports of pa. the compendium coding scheme links a five-digit code that describes physical activities by major headings (e.g., occupation, transportation, etc.) and specific activities within each major heading with its intensity, defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate (met). energy expenditure in met-minutes, met-hours, kcal, or kcal per kilogram body weight can be estimated for specific activities by type or met intensity. additions to the compendium were obtained from studies describing daily pa patterns of adults and studies measuring the energy cost of specific physical activities in field settings. the updated version includes two new major headings of volunteer and religious activities, extends the number of specific activities from 477 to 605, and provides updated met intensity levels for selected activities.
@method computational logics and agents: a road map of current technologies and future trends this paper presents an argumentation based framework to support the decision making of an agent within a modular architecture for agents. the proposed argumentation framework is dynamic, with arguments and their strength depending on the particular context that the agent finds himself, thus allowing the agent to adapt his decisions in a changing environment. in addition, in order to enable the agent to operate within an open environment where the available information may be incomplete we have integrated abduction within this argumentation framework. this is particular useful when the agent finds himself in a dilemma and hence needs additional information to resolve this. we have also developed, motivated by work in cognitive psychology, within the same framework an argumentation based personality theory for agents thus incorporating a dimension of individuality in the decisions of the agent.
@background native vietnamese medicinal plants with anti-atopic dermatitis activity: a systematic review licorice (glycyrrhiza glabra l., leguminosae) is frequently used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory and allergic diseases. in this study, the main components (glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin) were isolated from licorice, and their anti-allergic effects, such as antiscratching behavior and ige production-inhibitory activity, were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid most potently inhibited the degranulation of rbl-2h3 cells induced by ige with the antigen (dnp-hsa) and rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction as well as the scratching behavior in mice induced by compound 48/80. these components inhibited the production of ige in ovalbumin-induced asthma mice but liquiritigenin had little effect. this suggests that the antiallergic effects of licorice are mainly due to glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and liquiritigenin, which can relieve ige-induced allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma.
@background comparing mental health of school-age children of parents with/without bipolar disorders: a case control study background to examine the risk for psychopathology in offspring at risk for bipolar disorder and the course of psychiatric disorders in these youth.   methods using structured diagnostic interviews (structured clinical interview for dsm-iv [scid] and kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia [k-sads]), psychiatric diagnoses of 117 nonreferred offspring of parents with diagnosed bipolar disorder were compared with those of 171 age- and gender-matched offspring of parents without bipolar disorder or major depression.   results compared with offspring of parents without mood disorders, high-risk youth had elevated rates of major depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders. high-risk offspring also had significantly more impaired global assessment of functioning (gaf) scores, higher rates of psychiatric treatment, and higher rates of placement in special education classes. disruptive behavior disorders, separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (gad), social phobia, and depression tended to have their onset in early or middle childhood, whereas bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), panic disorder, and substance use disorder had onset most frequently in adolescence.   conclusions these findings support the hypothesis that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder are at significantly increased risk for developing a wide range of severe psychiatric disorders and accompanying dysfunction. early disruptive behavior and anxiety disorders, as well as early-onset depression, may be useful markers of risk for subsequent bipolar disorder in high-risk samples.
@result paralympic athletes with cerebral palsy display altered pacing strategies in distance‐deceived shuttle running trials the studies of amann et al. (2006, 2007) conclude that feedback from fatiguing skeletal muscle during exercise at different reduces central motor output to the working muscles “in order to reinvent excessive development of peripheral muscle fatigue beyond a critical threshold or sensory tolerance limit” (amann et al. 2006, p. 950). we suggest that their findings can be better explained by hypoxia-induced changes in central motor output acting in an anticipatory manner.
@method the role of social actors in the sustainability of e-government implementation and use: experience from indonesian regencies the problem and the solution. this chapter overviews case study research and proposes a manner in which case study research can contribute to theory building in applied disciplines. although theory building using case study research has been discussed previously in the literature, there is no clarity as to how case study research can be used to build theory. moreover, it should not be assumed that there is clarity on the processes of case writing, case studies, or case study research. this chapter presents definitions, purposes, and elements of case study research for the purpose of understanding how case study research can be used to build theory in applied disciplines.
@method researching multilingually: new theoretical and methodological directions thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. in this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. we outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. we then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. we conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.
@background prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases in the indigenous qom population of rosario, argentina objective. the preclinical period of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies such as anticitrullinated protein antibodies (acpa) and rheumatoid factor (rf). little is known about the joint symptom profile preceding onset of ra, and whether symptoms are associated with ra autoantibodies. because first-degree relatives (fdr) of north american native (nan) ra probands exhibit multiple risk factors for development of future ra, we investigated the prevalence of joint symptoms in this high-risk population. methods. we studied 306 fdr of nan patients with ra, 323 nan controls (nc), and 293 white controls (wc) having no family history of autoimmune diseases. study subjects completed a questionnaire that asked whether they had pain, swelling, or morning stiffness in their hand joints, or in other joints. serum samples were gathered at the same time and tested for the presence of acpa, rf, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein levels. results. in all cases, fdr were significantly more likely to report experiencing joint symptoms compared to the 2 control groups. fdr also exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of ra autoantibodies than the control groups. there were modest trends for joint symptoms to associate with ra autoantibodies, and individuals who were both acpa-positive and rf-positive had the highest prevalence of joint symptoms. conclusion. fdr of nan patients with ra have a higher prevalence of joint symptoms compared to individuals with no family history of autoimmune disease. this finding is only partially explained by a high prevalence of ra autoantibodies in the fdr.
@result infantile anorexia and co-parenting: a pilot study on mother–father–child triadic interactions during feeding and play objective the aim of this study was to examine the differences among three subtypes of feeding disorders (fd), defined through the criteria of the dc:0-3r: "infantile anorexia" (ia), "feeding disorder associated with insults to the gastrointestinal tract" (fdigt), and "sensory food aversions" (sfa), by exploring mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   method the sample consisted of 146 italian mother-child pairs, of which 51 children with ia, 47 children with fdigt, and 48 mothers and their children with sfa. all dyads were videotaped during feeding; mothers completed questionnaires assessing their psychological profiles and eating attitudes, as well as their children's temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning.   results analyses revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups of fd in relation to mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   discussion both interactional and individual variables may contribute differently to specific fd and outcomes during childhood. definitions by fd subtypes, using operational diagnostic criteria, and the assessment of mother-child interactions are relevant to target interventions strategies to treat specific disorders.
@background rack1, a multifaceted scaffolding protein: structure and function background: peripheral anionic site (pas) blockade of acetylcholinesterase (ache) notably affects neuronal activity and cyto-architecture, however, the mechanism(s) involved are incompletely understood. objective: we wished to specify the pas extracellular effects on specific ache mrna splice variants, delineate the consequent cellular remodeling events, and explore the inhibitory effects on interchanging rack1 interactions. methods: we exposed rat hippocampal cultured neurons to bw284c51, the peripheral anionic site inhibitor of ache, and to the non-selective ache active site inhibitor, physostigmine for studying the neuronal remodeling of ache mrna expression and trafficking. results: bw284c51 induced overexpression of both ache splice variants, yet promoted neuritic translocation of the normally rare ache-r, and retraction of ache-s mrna in an antisense-suppressible manner. bw284c51 further caused modest decreases in the expression of the scaffold protein rack1 (receptor for activated protein kinase βii), followed by drastic neurite retraction of both rack1 and the ache homologue neuroligin1, but not the tubulin-associated map2 protein. accompanying bw284c51 effects involved decreases in the fyn kinase and membrane insertion of the glutamate receptor nr2b variant and impaired glutamatergic activities of treated cells. intriguingly, molecular modeling suggested that direct, non-catalytic competition with fyn binding by the rack1-interacting ache-r variant may be involved. conclusions: our findings highlight complex neuronal ache-r/rack1 interactions and are compatible with the hypothesis that peripheral site ache inhibitors induce rack1-mediated neuronal remodeling, promoting suppressed glutamatergic neurotransmission.
@method iaa–amido synthetase activity and gh3 expression during development of pea seedlings auxins are hormones involved in many cellular, physiological and developmental processes in seed plants and in mosses such as physcomitrella patens. control of auxin levels is achieved in higher plants via synthesis of auxin conjugates by members of the gh3 family. the role of the two gh3-like proteins from p. patens for growth and auxin homeostasis was therefore analysed. the in vivo-function of the two p. patens gh3 genes was investigated using single and double knockout mutants. the two p. patens gh3 proteins were also heterologously expressed to determine their enzymatic activity. both p. patens gh3 enzymes accepted the auxin indole acetic acid (iaa) as substrate, but with different preferences for the amino acid to which it is attached. cytoplasmic localization was shown for ppgh3-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (gfp). targeted knock-out of either gene exhibited an increased sensitivity to auxin, resulting in growth inhibition. on plain mineral media mutants had higher levels of free iaa and less conjugated iaa than the wild type, and this effect was enhanced when auxin was supplied. the deltappgh3-1/deltappgh3-2 double knockout had almost no iaa amide conjugates but still synthesized ester conjugates. taken together, these data suggest a developmentally controlled involvement of p. patens gh3 proteins in auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess of physiologically active free auxin to inactive iaa-amide conjugates.
@background genomic characterization of group c orthobunyavirus reference strains and recent south american clinical isolates bunyaviruses are a large family of segmented rna viruses which, like influenza virus, use a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription whereby short capped primers derived by endonucleolytic cleavage of host mrnas are used by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (l-protein) to transcribe viral mrnas. it was recently shown that the cap-snatching endonuclease of influenza virus resides in a discrete n-terminal domain of the pa polymerase subunit. here we structurally and functionally characterize a similar endonuclease in la crosse orthobunyavirus (lacv) l-protein. we expressed n-terminal fragments of the lacv l-protein and found that residues 1-180 have metal binding and divalent cation dependent nuclease activity analogous to that of influenza virus endonuclease. the 2.2 å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the domain confirms that lacv and influenza endonucleases have similar overall folds and identical two metal binding active sites. the in vitro activity of the lacv endonuclease could be abolished by point mutations in the active site or by binding 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (dpba), a known influenza virus endonuclease inhibitor. a crystal structure with bound dpba shows the inhibitor chelating two active site manganese ions. the essential role of this endonuclease in cap-dependent transcription was demonstrated by the loss of transcriptional activity in a rnp reconstitution system in cells upon making the same point mutations in the context of the full-length lacv l-protein. using structure based sequence alignments we show that a similar endonuclease almost certainly exists at the n-terminus of l-proteins or pa polymerase subunits of essentially all known negative strand and cap-snatching segmented rna viruses including arenaviruses (2 segments), bunyaviruses (3 segments), tenuiviruses (4–6 segments), and orthomyxoviruses (6–8 segments). this correspondence, together with the well-known mapping of the conserved polymerase motifs to the central regions of the l-protein and influenza pb1 subunit, suggests that l-proteins might be architecturally, and functionally equivalent to a concatemer of the three orthomyxovirus polymerase subunits in the order pa-pb1-pb2. furthermore, our structure of a known influenza endonuclease inhibitor bound to lacv endonuclease suggests that compounds targeting a potentially broad spectrum of segmented rna viruses, several of which are serious or emerging human, animal and plant pathogens, could be developed using structure-based optimisation.
@result high responsivity to threat during the initial stage of perception in repression: a 3 t fmri study. this research project posits a model of repression that incorporates both repressive personality and repressive social behavior. the 1st parameter of the model specifies the motivation for repressors' distancing of themselves from emotional events. experiment 1 demonstrates that repressors are hypersensitive--in their cognitive attention--to both negative and positive emotional events. the 2nd parameter of the model specifies the conditions under which repressors distance themselves from emotional events. experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that repressors psychologically distance themselves when the situation threatens their self-evaluation and provides opportunity for them to attend to and process self-relevant and non-self-relevant information. this 2-factor model extends the current conceptualization of repression in that it identifies motivation (dispositional emotional sensitivity) and context (situational threats to self-evaluation and distraction availability) for repressors' distancing of themselves from negative and positive emotional events.
@result a tract-based spatial statistics study in anorexia nervosa: abnormality in the fornix and the cerebellum the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (an) is associated with high anxiety. the brain mechanisms that drive those behaviors are unknown. in this study we wanted to test whether brain white matter (wm) integrity is altered in an, and related to heightened anxiety. sixteen adult women with an (mean age 24 ± 7 years) and 17 healthy control women (cw, mean age 25 ± 4 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (dti) of the brain. the dti brain images were used to calculate the fractional anisotropy (fa) of wm tracts, which is a measure for wm integrity. an individuals compared to cw showed clusters of significantly reduced fa (p<0.05, corrected) in the bilateral fimbria-fornix and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, as well as the posterior cingulum wm. in the an group, harm avoidance was predicted by fa in the left and right fimbria-fornix. those findings were not due to wm volume deficits in an. this study indicates that wm integrity is abnormal in an in limbic and association pathways, which could contribute to disturbed feeding, emotion processing and body perception in an. the prediction of harm avoidance in an by fimbria-fornix wm integrity suggests that this pathway may be mechanistically involved in high anxiety in an.
@background cytochrome p450 and abcb1 genetics: association with quetiapine and norquetiapine plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations and with clinical response in patients suffering from schizophrenia. a pilot study authors' objectives the main objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia in comparison with conventional antipsychotic drugs, placebo and other atypical antipsychotic drugs. the secondary objectives of the review were to investigate response in those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with predominantly negative symptoms or experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia.
@background patient-related factors and complications after arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon background arthroscopic management has been recommended for some superior labrum anterior and posterior (slap) lesions, but no studies have focused on patients over 50 years of age with rotator cuff tear and a type ii slap lesion. hypothesis in patients over 50 years of age with an arthroscopically confirmed lesion of the rotator cuff and a type ii slap lesion, there is no difference between (1) repair of both lesions and (2) repair of the rotator cuff tear without repair of the slap ii lesion but with a tenotomy of the long head of the biceps. study design randomized controlled clinical trial; level of evidence, 1. methods we recruited 63 patients. in 31 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and the type ii slap lesion (group 1). in the other 32 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and tenotomized the long head of the biceps (group 2). seven patients (2 in group 1 and 5 in group 2) were lost to final follow-up. results at a minimum 2.9 years’ follow-up, statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the university of california, los angeles (ucla) score and range of motion values. in group 1 (slap repair and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.4 (range, 6–14) to an average of 27.9 (range, 24–35) postoperatively (p < .001). in group 2 (biceps tenotomy and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.1 (range, 5–14) to an average of 32.1 (range, 30–35) postoperatively (p < .001) there was a statistically significant difference in total postoperative ucla scores and range of motion when comparing the 2 groups postoperatively (p < .05). conclusions there are no advantages in repairing a type ii slap lesion when associated with a rotator cuff tear in patients over 50 years of age. the association of rotator cuff repair and biceps tenotomy provides better clinical outcome compared with repair of the type ii slap lesion and the rotator cuff.
@method robustness of treatment planning for electrochemotherapy of deep-seated tumors irreversible electroporation (ire) is a new tissue ablation technique in which micro to millisecond electrical pulses are delivered to undesirable tissue to produce cell necrosis through irreversible cell membrane permeabilization. ire affects only the cell membrane and no other structure in the tissue. the goal of the study is to test our ire tissue ablation methodology in the pig liver, provide first experience results on long term histopathology of ire ablated tissue, and discuss the clinical implications of the findings. the study consists of: a) designing an ire ablation protocol through a mathematical analysis of the electrical field during electroporation; b) using ultrasound to position the electroporation electrodes in the predetermined locations and subsequently to monitor the process; c) applying the predetermined electrotroporation pulses; d) performing histolopathology on the treated samples for up to two weeks after the procedure; and e) correlating the mathematical analysis, ultrasound data, and histology. we observed that electroporation affects tissue in a way that can be imaged in real time with ultrasound, which should facilitate real time control of electroporation during clinical applications. we observed cell ablation to the margin of the treated lesion with several cells thickness resolution. there appears to be complete ablation to the margin of blood vessels without compromising the functionality of the blood vessels, which suggests that ire is a promising method for treatment of tumors near blood vessels (a significant challenge with current ablation methods). consistent with the mechanism of action of ire on the cell membrane only, we show that the structure of bile ducts, blood vessels, and connective tissues remains intact with ire. we report extremely rapid resolution of lesions, within two weeks, which is consistent with retention of vasculature. we also document tentative evidence for an immunological response to the ablated tissue. last, we show that mathematical predictions with the laplace equation can be used in treatment planning. the ire tissue ablation technique, as characterized in this report, may become an important new tool in the surgeon armamentarium.
@background ischemic stroke associated with cough and cold preparation containing methylephedrine and supplement containing chinese herbal drugs. background dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids (sometimes called ma huang) are widely promoted and used in the united states as a means of losing weight and increasing energy. in the light of recently reported adverse events related to use of these products, the food and drug administration (fda) has proposed limits on the dose and duration of use of such supplements. the fda requested an independent review of reports of adverse events related to the use of supplements that contained ephedra alkaloids to assess causation and to estimate the level of risk the use of these supplements poses to consumers.   methods we reviewed 140 reports of adverse events related to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids that were submitted to the fda between june 1, 1997, and march 31, 1999. a standardized rating system for assessing causation was applied to each adverse event.   results thirty-one percent of cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31 percent were deemed to be possibly related. among the adverse events that were deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, 47 percent involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18 percent involved the central nervous system. hypertension was the single most frequent adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13); stroke (10); and seizures (7). ten events resulted in death, and 13 events produced permanent disability, representing 26 percent of the definite, probable, and possible cases.   conclusions the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids may pose a health risk to some persons. these findings indicate the need for a better understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of such dietary supplements.
@method facial expression recognition and expression intensity estimation within the past decade, significant effort has occurred in developing methods of facial expression analysis. because most investigators have used relatively limited data sets, the generalizability of these various methods remains unknown. we describe the problem space for facial expression analysis, which includes level of description, transitions among expressions, eliciting conditions, reliability and validity of training and test data, individual differences in subjects, head orientation and scene complexity image characteristics, and relation to non-verbal behavior. we then present the cmu-pittsburgh au-coded face expression image database, which currently includes 2105 digitized image sequences from 182 adult subjects of varying ethnicity, performing multiple tokens of most primary facs action units. this database is the most comprehensive testbed to date for comparative studies of facial expression analysis.
@background in vitro effectiveness of acidic and alkline solutions on scolices of hydatid cyst hydatid disease is a parasitic disease that is treated primarily by surgery. the most important complication of surgical treatment is spillage of the contents of the cyst, leading to secondary dissemination. in this study, the effect of chlorhexidine gluconate (chx-glu) was investigated in the treatment of experimental intraperitoneal hydatidosis (iph). iph was reproduced in 100 wistar albino rats by inoculation with 1 ml of a suspension contained approximately 1500 viable protoscolices of echinococcus granulosus following determination of scolicidal activity of chlorhexidine gluconate in vitro. five minutes after protoscolex inoculation, 5 ml of the scolicidal solution was instilled into the peritoneal cavity: 0.9% nacl (control group), 4.0% chx-glu, 0.4% chx-glu, and 0.04% chx-glu. after 6 months of follow-up, the rats were sacrificed, and the number of isolated cysts, peroperative and postoperative deaths, and toxicity were evaluated. cyst formation did not occur in any of the chx-glu groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas it was detected in all of the control rats. in addition, to 4.0% chx-glu was found to be more toxic and to cause a high mortality rate compared to the 0.4% and 0.04% chx-glu groups and the control group (p < 0.05). chx-glu 0.04% was found to be the most potent, nontoxic agent; it is easily available, inexpensive, and highly potent in a short period of time at the low concentration. chx-glu 0.04% can be used safely in the treatment of intraperitoneal hydatidosis and hydatid cyst.
@result distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) protein and mrna in the normal adult rat cns: evidence for anterograde axonal transport the site and regulation of neurotrophic factor release from neurons is poorly understood. we used a combination of model cell lines and primary culture systems to study the polarity of bdnf sorting and the regulation of its release from hippocampal neurons. transfection and expression of a human bdnf cdna in a mouse pituitary cell line, att20, resulted in the colocalization of bdnf with the secretory granule marker, chromogranin a. furthermore, stimulation of these cells with 56 mm kcl or with 5 mm 8-bromo-camp increased the release of bdnf approximately 10-to 15-fold within 30 min. to study bdnf release from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, cells were infected with a defective herpes simplex viral (hsv) vector expressing human bdnf. depolarizing conditions increased the release of bdnf 5-fold from these cells, further verifying that secretion is regulated. immunocytochemical analysis using highly specific antibodies determined that endogenous bdnf was predominantly localized to the somatodentritic domain of hippocampal neurons. these findings support the view that bdnf functions as a target-derived signal for afferents to hippocampal pyramidal cells and that it may serve as a regulator of hippocampal plasticity.

@result [relationship between cigarette smoking and the carbon monoxide concentration in the exhaled breath with perioperative respiratory complications]. objective to determine the impact of smoking on the rate of pulmonary and upper respiratory complications following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.   methods we retrospectively identified all patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery at one institution between january 2000 and january 2009. pulmonary and upper respiratory complications were defined as atelectasis, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum occurring within 30 days after surgery   results nine hundred three patients underwent attempt at laparoscopic surgery. fifty-four were excluded because of conversion to laparotomy and 31 because of insufficient data. of the 818 patients included, 356 (43%) had cancer. a total of 576 (70%) patients were never smokers, 156 (19%) were past smokers, and 86 (10%) were current smokers (smoked within 6 weeks before surgery). these three groups were similar with regard to median body mass index, operative time, and length of hospital stay. compared to never and past smokers, current smokers were more likely to undergo high-complexity laparoscopic procedures (10.4%, 15.4%, and 19.8%, respectively; p=0.015) and had younger median age 49 years, 51 years, and 46 years, respectively; p=0.035. nineteen (2.3%) patients experienced pulmonary complications - symptomatic atelectasis (n=9), pneumonia (n=5), acute respiratory failure (n=2), hypoxemia (n=1), pneumomediastinum (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=2). the rate of pulmonary complications was 2.1% (12 of 564 patients) in never smokers, 4.5% (7 of 156 patients) in past smokers, and zero in current smokers.   conclusion in this cohort, smoking history did not appear to impact postoperative pulmonary and upper respiratory complications. in smokers scheduled for operative procedures, laparoscopy should be considered when feasible.
@method investigation of pathways for the low-ph conformational transition in influenza hemagglutinin. viral envelope glycoproteins promote viral infection by mediating the fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane. structural and biochemical studies of two viral glycoproteins, influenza hemagglutinin and hiv-1 envelope protein, have led to a common model for viral entry. the fusion mechanism involves a transient conformational species that can be targeted by therapeutic strategies. this mechanism of infectivity is likely utilized by a wide variety of enveloped viruses for which similar therapeutic interventions should be possible.
@method neural correlates of after-effects caused by adaptation to multiple face displays the psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task. this paper, together with its companion paper (wichmann & hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function’s parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. the present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. using monte carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. first, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (orlapses). we show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function’s parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. we demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditionalx2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of monte carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. we have made available the software to implement our methods.
@result is there any relationship between medication compliance and affective temperaments in patients with type 2 diabetes? background in non-diabetic populations, anxious and depressive affective temperaments are associated with stress and distress disorders (anxious and depressive). in type 2 diabetes, distress with diabetes and distress disorders have been associated with metabolic control. there are few studies undertaken on temperament and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. the aim of our study was to examine the independent association between affective temperaments and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.   methods the sample included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes from two outpatient clinics aged 53.54 (sd ± 8.05) years and with 66.7% female gender. depression was evaluated by using the madrs observer rating scale (mean value: 16.38 ± 11).   results patients with excessive depressive and anxious temperaments had more depressive symptoms, worse psychological adjustment to diabetes and worse metabolic control. in logistic regression (crude model), only depressive temperament was independently associated with metabolic control.   conclusions affective temperaments are associated with psychological adjustment to diabetes and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. patients above threshold on depressive temperament should be considered for greater scrutiny and psycho-education by the diabetes clinic staff.
@background prolactin-stimulated survivin induction is required for beta cell mass expansion during pregnancy in mice objective—diabetes results from a deficiency of functional β-cells due to both an increase in β-cell death and an inhibition of β-cell replication. the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects in susceptible individuals are mostly unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether a gene critical for cell division and cell survival in cancer cells, survivin, might also be important for β-cells. research design and methods—we generated mice harboring a conditional deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells using mice with a pax-6-cre transgene promoter construct driving tissue-specific expression of cre-recombinase in these cells. we performed metabolic studies and immunohistochemical analyses to determine the effects of a mono- and biallelic deletion of survivin. results—selective deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells in the mouse had no discernible effects during embryogenesis but was associated with striking decreases in β-cell number after birth, leading to hyperglycemia and early-onset diabetes by 4 weeks of age. serum insulin levels were significantly decreased in animals lacking endocrine cell survivin, with relative stability of other hormones. exogenous expression of survivin in mature β-cells lacking endogenous survivin completely rescued the hyperglycemic phenotype and the decrease in β-cell mass, confirming the specificity of the survivin effect in these cells. conclusions—our findings implicate survivin in the maintenance of β-cell mass through both replication and antiapoptotic mechanisms. given the widespread involvement of survivin in cancer, a novel role for survivin may well be exploited in β-cell regulation in diseased states, such as diabetes.
@background suspected spontaneous reports of birth defects in the uk associated with the use of carbimazole and propylthiouracil in pregnancy maternal thyrotoxicosis, predominantly secondary to graves' disease, affects 0.2% of all pregnancies. the endocrine society guidelines recommend the use of propylthiouracil as a first-line drug for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy because of associations between carbimazole or methimazole and congenital anomalies. however, recent studies have highlighted the risk of severe liver injury with propylthiouracil. here, we report another case with multiple congenital anomalies following in utero exposure to carbimazole and review the literature to consider the risks and benefits of available pharmacological treatments for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
@background linking supply to demand: the neuronal monocarboxylate transporter mct2 and the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxyl‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole‐propionic acid receptor glur2/3 subunit are associated in a common trafficking process ampa receptors mediate the majority of the fast excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. much evidence suggests that the fast trafficking of ampa receptors into and out of the postsynaptic membrane underlies changes in synaptic strength thought to be necessary for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. despite the abundance of research conducted in this area, a direct, real-time functional assay that measures the trafficking of native ampa receptors has been lacking. toward this aim, we use a photoreactive, irreversible antagonist of ampa receptors, anqx, to rapidly silence surface ampa receptors and investigate directly the trafficking of native ampa receptors in real time. we find that the most dynamic movement of ampa receptors occurs by lateral movement across the surface of neurons. fast cycling of surface ampa receptors with receptors from internal stores does occur but exclusively at extrasynaptic somatic sites. the cycling of synaptic ampa receptors only occurs on a much longer timescale with complete exchange requiring at least 16 hr. this cycling is not dependent on protein synthesis or action potential driven network activity. these data suggest a revised model of ampa receptor trafficking wherein a large internal store of ampa receptors exchanges rapidly with extrasynaptic somatic ampa receptors, and these newly inserted ampa receptors then travel laterally along dendrites to reside stably at synapses.
@background insulin-like growth factor-i correlates more closely than growth hormone with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in patients with acromegaly unlabelled insulin resistance (ir) can be induced by high amounts of growth hormone (gh).   aim to set up, in acromegaly without diabetes mellitus, a correlation between the disease activity in gh-secreting adenoma (aa) - assessed by minimum gh serum level during an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) - and severity of insulin resistance (ir), assessed by homa-ir index.   methods 75 out of 88 consecutive patients with acromegaly hospitalized in our department were included in this study. 13 patients proved to have diabetes mellitus and were excluded. serum glucose, gh and insulin levels were measured by immunoradiometricassay basal and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after a 75 g ogtt in 88 patients with active or cured acromegaly. ir was assessed using homa-ir index (homa-ir=basal serum glucose (mg/dl) x basal serum insulin (mu/l)/22.5 x 18). a value over 2.5 was considered indicating ir.   results out of 75 patients without diabetes mellitus, 36 subjects (48%) were presenting with ir (34 with active disease, 2 cured). we found a significant positive correlation (r=0.56, p<0.001) between aa and homa-ir. the gh minimal level corresponding to the intersection of the exponential regression curve with the homa-ir level of 2.5 was 8.8 ng/ml, a cut-off point indicating ir with 82% specificity and 78% sensitivity. the odds ratio for developing ir becomes significant at a minimum gh level during ogtt of 2 ng/ml (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 2-29).   conclusions the severity of ir revealed by acromegaly correlates with gh production. a gh serum level higher than 2 ng/ml during ogtt indicates an increased risk for developing ir. this cut-off level of gh can be used as one of criteria of cured disease, regarding the lack of metabolic effects.
@background validation, repeatability and reproducibility of a noninvasive instrument for measuring thoracic and lumbar curvature of the spine in the sagittal plane. study design an observational study in which vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, developed in this study, was used to examine lumbar curvature. the intra- and interobserver reliability of the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis and the cobb technique were compared.   objectives to evaluate the reliability of a new method of measuring lumbar lordosis and to examine the changes in the lordotic curve from 0 degree to 90 degrees flexion of the trunk.   summary of background data several different methods are used to measure lumbar lordosis. the cobb technique, based on measurement of vertebral endplates, is the method most frequently adopted for clinical diagnosis. however, because of the variations in the vertebral endplate architecture, the vertebral surface angle is difficult to identify. this reduces the reliability of the cobb technique.   methods lateral radiographs of 16 study participants were taken from the upright position to a trunk flexion of 90 degrees in 30 degrees increments. the lumbar lordotic curve was measured by three observers individually using two applications of the traditional cobb technique and the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis.   results correlation coefficients of lumbar lordosis between the two methods ranged from 0.589 to 0.772 with participants standing upright (all p < 0.05). interobserver reliability coefficients were 0.903 for vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, 0.826 for cobb (l1-l5), and 0.784 for cobb (l1-s1), although the three measurements all revealed an excellent intraobserver reproducibility (r greater than 0.9). the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis showed the smallest mean absolute differences between any two observers' measurements (< 1.7 degrees).   conclusions the findings from this study indicate that the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis is more reliable than the cobb method for assessing lumbar lordosis. the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis also can be used to evaluate the actual lumbar curvature in outline at various angles of trunk flexion.

@result improved treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis with fluconazole plus probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr‐1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc‐14 vulvovaginal candidasis (vvc) is a common disease. the majority of cases is caused by candida albicans, but in recent years an increase has been observed in the frequency of non‐albicans candida infections, especially due to c. glabrata and c. tropicalis. the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of non‐albicans candida infections in patients suffering from vvc. therefore, the statistical data of culture‐confirmed vvc ascertained at the institute of hygiene (medical university graz) have been studied. altogether, 10 463 samples from patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000–2004, a number of 3184 proved to be culture‐positive for yeast. candida albicans was the most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. non‐albicans candida yeast were detected in 12.1%, mainly c. glabrata and saccharomyces cerevisiae. during a 1‐year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of vvc. patients aged 21–40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from vvc compared with other age‐related groups.
@background identification of genes upregulated by the transcription factor bcr1 that are involved in impermeability, impenetrability, and drug resistance of candida albicans a/α biofilms abstract although the fungus candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of humans, the organism is also an important opportunistic pathogen. most infections caused by c. albicans arise from organisms that were previously colonizing the host as commensals, and therefore successful establishment of colonization is a prerequisite for pathogenicity. to elucidate fungal activities that promote colonization, an analysis of the transcription profile of c. albicans cells recovered from the intestinal tracts of mice was performed. the results showed that within the c. albicans colonizing population, cells expressed genes characteristic of the laboratory-grown exponential phase and genes characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells. thus, gene expression both promoted the ability to grow rapidly (a characteristic of exponential-phase cells) and enhanced the ability to resist stresses (a characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells). similarities in gene expression in commensal colonizing cells and cells invading host tissue during disease were found, showing that c. albicans cells adopt a particular cell surface when growing within a host in both situations. in addition, transcription factors cph2p and tec1p were shown to regulate c. albicans gene expression during intestinal colonization.
@method methodological considerations in the analysis of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in tufted capuchins (cebus apella) 1. the measurement of steroid hormone metabolites from faeces in wild animal populations is a powerful, noninvasive tool in behavioural endocrinology of all major vertebrate taxa. however, because such research is often done in remote areas with limited infrastructure, storage of samples for hormone analysis over long periods at high temperature is a critical issue in field endocrinology. previous studies have indicated that storage of alcoholic faecal extracts is more reliable than storage of unprocessed faeces if no freezer is available, but a standardmethod has not been established yet. 2. we tested the validity of three commonly applied storage conditions – liquid extracts, dried extracts and extracts placed on solid-phase extraction (spe) cartridges – to preserve concentrations of glucocorticoid and androgenmetabolites from faecal extracts of olive baboons (papio anubis) at high temperature over 1 year. 3. temporal variation in concentrations was detected for all metabolites and all storage conditions, including values measured from the control condition, that is, extracts stored at 20°c. this suggested that most variation was due to interassay variability, corroborated by comparisons of variation in ‘quality controls’ and samples. 4. compared to frozen control samples, liquid extracts were stable for up to 24 weeks, extracts on spe cartridges were stable for up to 50 weeks, while steroidmetabolite concentrations in dried extracts decreased slightly over time. 5. if steroid samples have to be stored at ambient temperature, we suggest storage of liquid extracts for up to 24 weeks in a dark and cool place. for longer periods, spe cartridges should be applied as evaporation, a potential confound arising with long-term storage of liquid extracts at higher temperatures, is not a problem in this storage condition. storage of dried extracts is more cost-effective, but may result in small time-dependent changes in steroid concentrations.
@background the effect of foot orthoses and in-shoe wedges during cycling: a systematic review to validate the measurement of peak power output (ppo) using a short cycling sprint test (inertial load (il) test), we compare it to the widely accepted wingate anaerobic test (want). fifteen healthy, young, active subjects performed 2 experimental trials. in each trial, subjects warmed up and sprinted 4 times for the il test. after recovery, they cycled for 30 s at maximum capacity for the want. the experimental trial was replicated 3 d later to test for reliability. inter- and intra-day ppo measured with the il test was very reliable (r(1) = 0.99 and r(1) = 0.94, respectively). the correlation between the il and want was highly significant (r = 0.82; p < 0.001), although the absolute ppo values were markedly higher for the il test (1268 +/- 41 w vs. 786 +/- 27 w; p < 0.001). in conclusion, cycling ppo can be validly assessed with the il test. the higher ppo attained with an il test could be related to better identification of peak power, since both velocity and resistance are free to vary during the sprint in comparison with the want, where resistance is fixed. owing to the short duration of the sprint (4 s) and high intra-day reliability despite a short recovery time (180 s), the il test is optimal for repeated measurements of anaerobic performance.
@background shiga toxigenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli in water and fish from pay‐to‐fish ponds we have isolated one sorbitol-nonfermenting (snf) escherichia coli o157:h7 isolate and five sorbitolfermenting (sf) e. coli o157:h isolates that do not contain shiga toxin (stx) genes (stx). isolates originated from patients with diarrhea (n 5 4) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) (n 5 2). all isolates harbored a chromosomal eae gene encoding gamma-intimin as well as the plasmid genes e-hly and etp. the e. coli o157:h7 isolate was katp and espp positive. respective sera obtained from the patient with hus contained antibodies to the o157 lipopolysaccharide antigen. the stx-negative e. coli o157:h7 isolate is genetically related to stx-positive snf e. coli o157:h7. all stx-negative sf e. coli o157:h isolates belong to the same genetic cluster and are closely related to stx-positive sf e. coli o157:h isolates. our data indicate that stx-negative e. coli o157: h7/h variants may occur at a low frequency and cannot be recognized by diagnostic methods that target stx.
@background tocolysis for inhibiting preterm birth in extremely preterm birth, multiple gestations and in growth-restricted fetuses: a systematic review and meta-analysis we sought to estimate the effect of indomethacin on duration of pregnancy in women with dilated cervix between 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks. demographics, risk factors, and outcomes were compared in women 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks with a dilated cervix > or = 1 cm who received indomethacin versus no indomethacin therapy, stratified for cerclage. primary outcome was interval from presentation until delivery. of 222 singleton gestations, 68 (31%) received indomethacin. in unadjusted and adjusted analyses, no significant differences were observed in interval from presentation to delivery and preterm birth < 28, < 32, or < 35 weeks comparing the indomethacin and no indomethacin groups, even after stratification for cerclage. in multivariate logistic regression analysis limited to women receiving cerclage, preterm birth < 32 weeks (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.26, 1.25) and < 35 weeks (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23, 1.14) suggested a possible but not significant benefit for indomethacin use. indomethacin therapy in women with dilated cervix at 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks, regardless of cerclage or not, had no effect on pregnancy outcomes.
@result cortical speech-evoked response patterns in multiple auditory fields are correlated with behavioral discrimination ability. the rat auditory cortex is divided anatomically into several areas, but little is known about the functional differences in information processing between these areas. to determine the filter properties of rat posterior auditory field (paf) neurons, we compared neurophysiological responses to simple tones, frequency modulated (fm) sweeps, and amplitude modulated noise and tones with responses of primary auditory cortex (a1) neurons. paf neurons have excitatory receptive fields that are on average 65% broader than a1 neurons. the broader receptive fields of paf neurons result in responses to narrow and broadband inputs that are stronger than a1. in contrast to a1, we found little evidence for an orderly topographic gradient in paf based on frequency. these neurons exhibit latencies that are twice as long as a1. in response to modulated tones and noise, paf neurons adapt to repeated stimuli at significantly slower rates. unlike a1, neurons in paf rarely exhibit facilitation to rapidly repeated sounds. neurons in paf do not exhibit strong selectivity for rate or direction of narrowband one octave fm sweeps. these results indicate that paf, like nonprimary visual fields, processes sensory information on larger spectral and longer temporal scales than primary cortex.
@method analysis and modeling of mobile traffic using real traces reliable network measurements are a fundamental component of networking research as they enable network analysis, system debugging, performance evaluation and optimization. in particular, decoding the lte control channel would give access to the full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. although a few open-source implementations of lte are available, they do not provide tools to reliably decoding the lte control channel and, thus, accessing the scheduling information. in this paper, we present owl, an online watcher for lte that is able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames, significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. compared to previous attempts, owl grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained from the lte random access mechanism. this makes it possible to run our software on inexpensive hardware coupled with almost any software defined radio capable of sampling the lte signal with sufficient accuracy.
@result childhood dysglycemia: prevalence and outcome in a referral hospital transient hyperglycemia occurs as a part of stress response in acute illnesses and is brought about by elevated levels of counter regulatory hormones. it is frequently encountered but the exact prevalence and implications, especially in childhood have not been studied in detail. 758 children (1 month to 6 years) with acute illness were screened for hyperglycemia; of these 36 children were found to have a glucose level of ≥150 mg/dl at admission and were designated hyperglycemics. the overall prevalence of hyperglycemia was 4.7 per cent. the disease-wise prevalence in neurological disorders, septicemia, respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea was 7.9, 7.6, 4.2 and 3.0 per cent respectively. family history of diabetes did not predispose towards developing transient hyperglycemia. the demographic profile (age, sex, nutrition status and disease pattern) and severity of illness (as assessed by temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, duration of illness and hospitalization, treatment modalities required, hypoxia and acidosis) did not affect the prevalence, extent and the rate of normalization of hyperglycemia. the mortality in hyperglycemics was double (13.9%) as compared to 6.9% in non-hyperglycemics, although the difference was insignificant, statistically (o.r=2.17, ci=0.81–5.82, p>0.05). it was, therefore, concluded that transient hyperglycemia occurs in 4–5% of patients with acute pediatric illnesses. however, it does not significantly correlate with the clinical profile and severity of the illness, and has no immediate prognostic significance.
@background humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
@method ages induce oxidative stress and activate protein kinase c-beta(ii) in neonatal mesangial cells. the use of flow cytometric techniques has significantly aided the rapid advancement of our understanding of the process of apoptosis. our laboratory is currently involved in investigating the ways in which cells can be induced to die and some of the signals that may be involved. to this end, we are using flow cytometry to detect apoptosis in cell cultures and to measure intracellular changes that occur during apoptosis, in particular, alterations in parameters such as mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and gene expression. in this review of recent and ongoing research in our laboratory, we outline our studies on mechanisms of apoptosis by cytotoxic drugs, particularly in relation to the involvement of oxidative stress. in addition, we are studying the increased sensitivity to apoptosis seen in k652 cells that have been transfected with the p53 gene.

@background mutational analyses of c-flipr, the only murine short flip isoform, reveal requirements for disc recruitment death receptor signaling is initiated by the assembly of the deathinducing signaling complex, which culminates in the activation of the initiator caspase, either caspase-8 or caspase-10. a family of viral and cellular proteins, known as flip, plays an essential role in the regulation of death receptor signaling. viral flip (v-flip) and short cellular flip (c-flips) inhibit apoptosis by interfering with death receptor signaling. the structure and mechanisms of v-flip and c-flips remain largely unknown. here we report a high resolution crystal structure of mc159, a v-flip derived from the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is a member of the human poxvirus family. unexpectedly, the two tandem death effector domains (deds) of mc159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface. structure-based sequence analysis suggests that this interface is conserved in the tandem deds from other v-flip, c-flips, and caspase-8 and -10. strikingly, the overall packing arrangement between the two deds of mc159 resembles that between the caspase recruitment domains of apaf-1 and caspase-9. in addition, each ded of mc159 contains a highly conserved binding motif on the surface, to which loss-of-function mutations in mc159 map. these observations, in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of v-flip and suggest a mechanism by which v-flip and c-flips inhibit death receptor signaling.
@background an investigation into the factors of adoption of wireless applications for data management by nurses nearly two decades ago, british neurologist and author (awakenings and the man who mistook his wife for a hat), dr. oliver sacks, resolved health care’s current dilemma when he said: “there is only one cardinal rule in medicine: one must always listen to the patient.” if only it were that simple. and yet, for nursing—typically considered the “caring” constituency—it is that simple. problem is, nursing, as with every other health care constituency, has to serve several masters. the cruelest master of them all? the bottom line. unfortunately, nursing must all too often subjugate the ideal of listening to the patient to the reality of doing what is cost-effective. fortunately, there is a means to that ideal end—information technology (it).

@background use of telemedicine in spain — perceptions of patients , physicians , and pharmacists congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension are common causes of hospitalization in the elderly. short-term postdischarge clinical outcomes regarding compliance, symptom control, readmission, functional status, and mortality rates are in need of improvement. this observational study documents the results of a home-based case-managed telemedicine (cmtm) program delivered over a 2-month period postdischarge. a population of 851, predominantly elderly (over age 60), recently discharged patients were enrolled in the program. they received a nurse visit up to 3 times/week and home telemedicine monitoring (weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose, and oximeter recordings) on a daily basis. patient education was provided by the nurse and reinforced through telemedicine. compliance rates, quality of life parameters, patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and data regarding nine quality of care measures (qcm), hospital readmission, and mortality rates were documented. patient demographics and outcomes of care were analyzed. there were 68% females and 56% african americans. the readmission rate was 13% and mortality 2%. treatment goals were met in 67%, patient compliance rate was 77%, and the average improvement in the nine qcm indicators was 66%. a majority of patients showed improved quality of health perception, better disease understanding, and high satisfaction rates with telemedicine. this is one of the larger observational studies in a predominantly elderly patient population enrolled in a cmtm program, to date. this model of care was well accepted by the elderly and produced excellent short-term clinical outcomes.
@background newborn care and knowledge translation - perceptions among primary healthcare staff in northern vietnam this randomized controlled study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program entitled 'capacity building for community leaders in a healthy living environment,' and to assess the usefulness of a participatory style of education and the applicability of an intersectoral approach in the educational process. an intervention group and a control group (consisting of 150 and 154 community leaders, respectively) were both evaluated, after the intervention group took part in a 5-day participatory-style educational program. healthy living environment promotion competency (hpc) was evaluated by an instrument consisted of four competency areas: identifying the steps required for a healthy living environment; understanding the principles to reduce potential health risks; providing public health management to improve the living environment; and applying the principles of health communication skills. scores between the intervention and control groups were examined to identify changes between the baseline and post-intervention periods. a qualitative evaluation of the educational program by participants and facilitators was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the intervention. the results indicated significant increases in the total hpc score and scores of individual hpc competency areas in the intervention group. thus, the effectiveness of a capacity building program for community leaders in a healthy living environment was demonstrated. qualitative evaluation revealed that the participatory-style and intersectoral collaboration approach facilitated the educational process. community leaders, who are representatives of various sectors and mass organizations within the community, can be important implementers in the promotion of a healthy living environment.
@background boule gene expression underpins the meiotic arrest in spermatogenesis in male rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to dehp and butachlor. the deleted in azoospermia (daz) genes encode potential rna-binding proteins that are expressed exclusively in prenatal and postnatal germ cells and are strong candidates for human fertility factors. here we report the identification of an additional member of the daz gene family, which we have called boule. with the identification of this gene, it is clear that the human daz gene family contains at least three members: daz, a y-chromosome gene cluster that arose 30–40 million years ago and whose deletion is linked to infertility in men; dazl, the “father” of daz, a gene that maps to human chromosome 3 and has homologs required for both female and male germ cell development in other organisms; and boule, a gene that we propose is the “grandfather” of daz and maps to human chromosome 2. human and mouse boule resemble the invertebrate meiotic regulator boule, the proposed ortholog of daz, in sequence and expression pattern and hence likely perform a similar meiotic function. in contrast, the previously identified human daz and dazl are expressed much earlier than boule in prenatal germ stem cells and spermatogonia; dazl also is expressed in female germ cells. these data suggest that homologs of the daz gene family can be grouped into two subfamilies (boule and dazl) and that members of the daz family evolved from an ancestral meiotic regulator, boule, to assume distinct, yet overlapping, functions in germ cell development.
@method a three‐plane architectonic atlas of the rat hippocampal region we studied the distribution and coexpression of vesicular glutamate transporters (vglut1, vglut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and calretinin (cr, calcium-binding protein) in rat entorhinal cortex, using immunofluorescence staining and multichannel confocal laser scanning microscopy. images were computer processed and subjected to automated 3d object recognition, colocalization analysis and 3d reconstruction. since the vgluts (in contrast to cr and gad) occurred in fibers and axon terminals only, we focused our attention on these neuronal processes. an intense, punctate vglut1-staining occurred everywhere in the entorhinal cortex. our computer program resolved these punctae as small 3d objects. also vglut2 showed a punctate immunostaining pattern, yet with half the number of 3d objects per tissue volume compared with vglut1, and with statistically significantly larger 3d objects. both vgluts were distributed homogeneously across cortical layers, with in mea vglut1 slightly more densely distributed than in lea. the distribution pattern and the size distribution of gad 3d objects resembled that of vglut2. cr-immunopositive fibers were abundant in all cortical layers. in double-stained sections we noted ample colocalization of cr and vglut2, whereas coexpression of cr and vglut1 was nearly absent. also in triple-staining experiments (vglut2, gad and cr combined) we noted coexpression of vglut2 and cr and, in addition, frequent coexpression of gad and cr. modest colocalization occurred of vglut2 and gad, and incidental colocalization of all three markers. we conclude that the cr-containing axon terminals in the entorhinal cortex belong to at least two subpopulations of cr-neurons: a glutamatergic excitatory and a gabaergic inhibitory.
@background long distance movement of dir1 and investigation of the role of dir1-like during systemic acquired resistance in arabidopsis abietane diterpenoids are major constituents of conifer resins that have important industrial and medicinal applications. however, their function in plants is poorly understood. here we show that dehydroabietinal (da), an abietane diterpenoid, is an activator of systemic acquired resistance (sar), which is an inducible defense mechanism that is activated in the distal, non-colonized, organs of a plant that has experienced a local foliar infection. da was purified as a sar-activating factor from vascular sap of arabidopsis thaliana leaves treated with a sar-inducing microbe. locally applied da is translocated through the plant and systemically induces the accumulation of salicylic acid (sa), an important activator of defense, thus leading to enhanced resistance against subsequent infections. the npr1 (non-expressor of pr genes1), fmo1 (flavin-dependent monooxygenase1) and dir1 (defective in induced resistance1) genes, which are critical for biologically induced sar, are also required for the da-induced sar, which is further enhanced by azelaic acid, a defense priming molecule. in response to the biological induction of sar, da in vascular sap is redistributed into a sar-inducing 'signaling da' pool that is associated with a trypsin-sensitive high molecular weight fraction, a finding that suggests that da-orchestrated sar involves a vascular sap protein(s).
@background policy trap and optimal subsidization policy under limited supply of vaccines the term "herd immunity" is widely used but carries a variety of meanings. some authors use it to describe the proportion immune among individuals in a population. others use it with reference to a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection. still others use it to refer to a pattern of immunity that should protect a population from invasion of a new infection. a common implication of the term is that the risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals (this is sometimes referred to as "indirect protection" or a "herd effect"). we provide brief historical, epidemiologic, theoretical, and pragmatic public health perspectives on this concept.
@background sox2 up-regulation and glial cell proliferation following degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons in the adult mouse inner ear the mammalian cochlea is innervated by two classes of sensory neurons. type i neurons make up 90–95% of the cochlear nerve and contact single inner hair cells to provide acoustic analysis as we know it. in contrast, the far less numerous type ii neurons arborize extensively among outer hair cells (ohcs) and supporting cells. their scarcity and smaller calibre axons have made them the subject of much speculation, but little experimental progress for the past 50 years. here we record from type ii fibres near their terminal arbors under ohcs to show that they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input. the type ii peripheral arbor conducts action potentials, but the small and infrequent glutamatergic excitation indicates a requirement for strong acoustic stimulation. furthermore, we show that type ii neurons are excited by atp. exogenous atp depolarized type ii neurons, both directly and by evoking glutamatergic synaptic input. these results prove that type ii neurons function as cochlear afferents, and can be modulated by atp. the lesser magnitude of synaptic drive dictates a fundamentally different role in auditory signalling from that of type i afferents.
@background adaptive reorganization of cortical networks in alzheimer’s disease background and purpose two mechanisms for recovery from aphasia, repair of damaged language networks and activation of compensatory areas, have been proposed. in this study, we investigated whether both mechanisms or one instead of the other take place in the brain of recovered aphasic patients.   methods using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional mri (fmri), we studied cortical language networks during lexical-semantic processing tasks in 7 right-handed aphasic patients at least 5 months after the onset of left-hemisphere stroke and had regained substantial language functions since then.   results we found that in the recovered aphasic patient group, functional language activity significantly increased in the right hemisphere and nonsignificantly decreased in the left hemisphere compared with that in the normal group. bilateral language networks resulted from partial restitution of damaged functions in the left hemisphere and activation of compensated (or recruited) areas in the right hemisphere. failure to restore any language function in the left hemisphere led to predominantly right hemispheric networks in some individuals. however, better language recovery, at least for lexical-semantic processing, was observed in individuals who had bilateral rather than right hemisphere-predominant networks.   conclusions the results indicate that the restoration of left-hemisphere language networks is associated with better recovery and inversely related to activity in the compensated or recruited areas of the right hemisphere.
@background bmpr2 loss in fibroblasts promotes mammary carcinoma metastasis via increased inflammation initiation of bmp signaling is dependent upon activation of type i bmp receptor by constitutively active type ii bmp receptor. three type ii bmp receptors have been identified; acvr2a and acvr2b serve as receptors for bmps and for activin‐like ligands whereas bmpr‐ii functions only as a bmp receptor. as bmp signaling is required for endochondral ossification and loss of either acvr2a or acvr2b is not associated with deficits in limb development, we hypothesized that bmpr‐ii would be essential for bmp signaling during skeletogenesis. we removed bmpr‐ii from early limb mesoderm by crossing bmpr‐ii floxed mice with those carrying the prx1‐cre transgene. mice lacking limb expression of bmpr‐ii have normal skeletons that could not be distinguished from control littermates. from these data, we conclude that bmpr‐ii is not required for endochondral ossification in the limb where loss of bmpr‐ii may be compensated by bmp utilization of acvr2a and acvr2b. genesis, 00:1‐6, 2011. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.
@method testosterone and financial risk preferences we hypothesized from the parasite theory of sexual selection that men (homo sapiens) would prefer averageness and symmetry in women's faces, that women would prefer averageness and symmetry in men's faces, and that women would prefer largeness (not averageness) of the secondary sexual traits of men's faces. we generated computer images of men's and women's faces and of composites of the faces of each sex, and then had men and women rate opposite-sex faces for 4 variables (attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy). symmetry, averageness, and the sizes of facial features were measured on the computerized faces. the hypotheses were supported, with the exception of the hypothesized effects of averageness of female and male faces on attractiveness ratings. this is the first study to show that facial symmetry has a positive influence on facial attractiveness ratings.

@background long-term leaf production response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone in this review i am drawing attention to some constraints and biases in co2 enrichment experiments and the analysis of data in the literature. conclusions drawn from experimental works differ when the data are grouped in a way such that the relative frequency of test conditions does not determine the emerging trends, for instance unrealistically strong co2-'fertilization' effects, which are in conflict with some basic ecological principles. i suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (i); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (ii); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (lai) and fine root renewal (iii). data for 10 type iii experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated co2 on plant biomass production, if any. in steady-state grassland, the effects are water-related; in closed tree stands, initial effects decline rapidly with time. plant-soil coupling (soil conditions) deserves far greater attention than plant-atmosphere coupling (co2 enrichment technology).

@result oxytocin increases autonomic cardiac control: moderation by loneliness background in nonhuman mammals, the neuropeptide oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to increase social approach behavior and pair bonding. in particular, central nervous oxytocin reduces behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and is suggested to mediate the rewarding aspects of attachment in highly social species. however, to date there have been no studies investigating the effects of central oxytocin mechanisms on behavior and physiology in human couple interaction.   methods in a double-blind placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before a standard instructed couple conflict discussion in the laboratory. the conflict session was videotaped and coded for verbal and nonverbal interaction behavior (e.g., eye contact, nonverbal positive behavior, and self-disclosure). salivary cortisol was repeatedly measured during the experiment.   results oxytocin significantly increased positive communication behavior in relation to negative behavior during the couple conflict discussion (f = 4.18, p = .047) and significantly reduced salivary cortisol levels after the conflict compared with placebo (f = 7.14, p = .011).   conclusions these results are in line with animal studies indicating that central oxytocin facilitates approach and pair bonding behavior. our findings imply an involvement of oxytocin in couple interaction and close relationships in humans.
@background primary intracranial melanoma with early leptomeningeal spread: a case report and treatment options available primary central nervous system (cns) melanoma is a type of rare and aggressive tumor that can easily spread to the leptomeninges, and in fact, leptomeningeal metastasis is one of the most serious complications in patients with this carcinoma. prognosis is extremely poor if a cns melanoma has metastasized, and there are no effective treatments. here, we present a case of a 37-year-old woman who presented with horizontal diplopia and progressive headache. magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with the diagnosis of melanoma. the results of cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) showed malignant cells characteristic of melanoma. no extracranial lesions were observed. all of the available evidence confirmed a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from a primary cns melanoma. the patient received aggressive treatment, which consisted of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf methotrexate (mtx) followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx. her survival time was 13 months after diagnosis. this case report suggests that the modality of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf mtx followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx may be used as the mainstay of treatment for such patients.
@method ethnic differences in total and hdl cholesterol among turkish, moroccan and dutch ethnic groups living in amsterdam, the netherlands background ethnic minorities living in western societies may have a higher prevalence of diabetes. we investigated whether the prevalence of diabetes among turkish and moroccan migrants differs from the indigenous urban population in the netherlands, and whether these differences can be explained by differences in risk factors.   methods in 2004 a general health survey, stratified by ethnicity and age, was carried out among the population of amsterdam. the current study included 375 turkish, 314 moroccan and 417 dutch individuals aged 18-70 years. participants underwent a physical examination and a health interview. diabetes was based on self-report, the use of anti-diabetic medicine, blood glucose levels and hba1c.   results the prevalence of diabetes in the amsterdam population was significantly higher in turkish (5.6%) and moroccan (8.0%), compared to dutch individuals (3.1%). these differences, which were much larger after adjustment for age, were only partly explained by the lower socioeconomic status and higher frequency of obesity among ethnic minorities. the difference between dutch and moroccan individuals remained significant even after adjustments for multiple risk factors. the typical age of onset of diabetes in both turks and moroccans is respectively one and two decades younger than in the indigenous population.   conclusion diabetes is more prevalent among turkish and moroccan migrants as compared to the indigenous population. only part of this difference can be explained by differences in demographic and lifestyle risk factors.
@background heparg microencapsulated spheroids in dmso-free culture: novel culturing approaches for enhanced xenobiotic and biosynthetic metabolism cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. as distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. as cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to this class of anti-cancer drugs. therefore, substances that target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of solid tumors. with three-dimensional growth conditions, multicellular tumor spheroids (mcts) reproduce several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor regions. we here report the setup of a 3d cell culture compatible high-content screening system and the identification of nine substances from two commercially available drug libraries that specifically target cells in inner mcts core regions, while cells in outer mcts regions or in 2d cell culture remain unaffected. we elucidated the mode of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in inner mcts core regions critically depends on extracellular glucose concentrations. finally, combinational treatment with cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in mcts. the data presented here shows for the first time a high-content based screening setup on 3d tumor spheroids for the identification of substances that specifically induce cell death in inner tumor spheroid core regions. this validates the approach to use 3d cell culture screening systems to identify substances that would not be detectable by 2d based screening in otherwise similar culture conditions.
@method opposing effects of nitric oxide and prostaglandin inhibition on muscle mitochondrial vo(2) during exercise. prostaglandins, nitric oxide (no) and endothelial‐derived hyperpolarizing factors (edhfs) are substances that have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow during physical activity. we measured haemodynamics, plasma atp and at rest and during one‐legged knee‐extensor exercise (19 ± 1 w) in nine healthy subjects with and without intra‐arterial infusion of indomethacin (indo; 621 ± 17 μg min−1), indo +ng‐monomethyl‐l‐arginine (l‐nmma; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (double blockade) and indo +l‐nmma + tetraethylammonium chloride (tea; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (triple blockade). double and triple blockade lowered leg blood flow (lbf) at rest (p < 0.05), while it remained unchanged with indo. during exercise, lbf and vascular conductance were 2.54 ± 0.10 l min−1 and 25 ± 1 mmhg, respectively, in control and they were lower with double (33 ± 3 and 36 ± 4%, respectively) and triple (26 ± 4 and 28 ± 3%, respectively) blockade (p < 0.05), while there was no difference with indo. the lower lbf and vascular conductance with double and triple blockade occurred in parallel with a lower o2 delivery, cardiac output, heart rate and plasma [noradrenaline] (p < 0.05), while blood pressure remained unchanged and o2 extraction and femoral venous plasma [atp] increased. despite the increased o2 extraction, leg was 13 and 17% (triple and double blockade, respectively) lower than control in parallel to a lower femoral venous temperature and lactate release (p < 0.05). these results suggest that no and prostaglandins play important roles in skeletal muscle blood flow regulation during moderate intensity exercise and that edhfs do not compensate for the impaired formation of no and prostaglandins. moreover, inhibition of no and prostaglandin formation is associated with a lower aerobic energy turnover and increased concentration of vasoactive atp in plasma.
